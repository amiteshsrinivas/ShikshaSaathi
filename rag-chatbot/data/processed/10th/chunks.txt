BEFORE YOU READ
Anneliese Marie ‘Anne’ Frank (12
June 1929 – February/March
1945) was a German – born
Jewish girl who wrote while in
hiding with her family and four
friends in Amsterdam during the
German occupation of the
Netherlands in World War II. Her
family had moved to Amsterdam
after the Nazis gained power in
Germany but were trapped when
the Nazi occupation extended into
the Netherlands. As persecutions
against the Jewish population
increased, the family went into
hiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank’s
office building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed
and transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died
of typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank.
Her father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam
after the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced
that it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in
English under the name The Diary of a Young Girl.
The diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday
and chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its
final entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its
original Dutch into many languages and became one of the world’s
most widely read books. There have also been several films,
television and theatrical productions, and even an opera, based on
the diary. Described as the work of a mature and insightful mind,
the diary provides an intimate examination of daily life under Nazi
occupation. Anne Frank has become one of the most renowned and
discussed of the Holocaust victims.
“This is a photo as I would wish
myself to look all the time. Then
I would, maybe, have a chance
to come to Hollywood.”
– Anne Frank, 10 October 1942

WRITING in a diary is a really strange experience for
someone like me. Not only because I’ve never written
anything before, but also because it seems to me
that later on neither I nor anyone else will be
interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old
schoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn’t matter. I feel like
writing, and I have an even greater need to get all
kinds of things off my chest.
‘Paper has more patience than people.’ I thought
of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling
a little depressed and was sitting at home with my
chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering
whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I
was, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience,
and since I’m not planning to let anyone else read
this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a
‘diary’, unless I should ever find a real friend, it
probably won’t make a bit of difference.
Now I’m back to the point that prompted me
to keep a diary in the first place: I don’t have a
friend.
Let me put it more clearly, since no one will
believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely
alone in the world. And I’m not. I have loving parents
and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about
thirty people I can call friends. I have a family,
loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I
seem to have everything, except my one true friend.
All I think about when I’m with friends is having a
good time. I can’t bring myself to talk about anything
but ordinary everyday things. We don’t seem to be
able to get any closer, and that’s the problem. Maybe
it’s my fault that we don’t confide in each other. In
any case, that’s just how things are, and
unfortunately they’re not liable to change. This is
why I’ve started the diary.
To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend
in my imagination, I don’t want to jot down the
facts in this diary the way most people would do,
but I want the diary to be my friend, and I’m going
to call this friend ‘Kitty’.

Why does Anne want to keep a diary?

Why did Anne think she could confide more in her diary than in people?
Since no one would understand a word of my
stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I’d better
provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike
doing so.
My father, the most adorable father I’ve ever seen,
didn’t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and
she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born
in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12
June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My
father emigrated to Holland in 1933. My mother,
Edith Hollander Frank, went with him to Holland
in September, while Margot and I were sent to
Aachen to stay with our grandmother. Margot went
to Holland in December, and I followed in February,
when I was plunked down on the table as a birthday
present for Margot.
I started right away at the Montessori nursery
school. I stayed there until I was six, at which time
I started in the first form. In the sixth form my
teacher was Mrs Kuperus, the headmistress. At the
end of the year we were both in tears as we said a
heartbreaking farewell.
In the summer of 1941 Grandma fell ill and had
to have an operation, so my birthday passed with
little celebration.
Grandma died in January 1942. No one knows
how often I think of her and still love her. This
birthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make
up for the other, and Grandma’s candle was lit along
with the rest.
The four of us are still doing well, and that brings
me to the present date of 20 June 1942, and the
solemn dedication of my diary.

Saturday, 20 June 1942
Dearest Kitty,
Our entire class is quaking in its boots. The
reason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in
which the teachers decide who’ll move up to the
next form and who’ll be kept back. Half the class is
making bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the
two boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have
staked their entire holiday savings on their bet.
From morning to night, it’s “You’re going to pass”,
“No, I’m not”, “Yes, you are”, “No, I’m not”. Even G.’s
pleading glances and my angry outbursts can’t calm
them down. If you ask me, there are so many
dummies that about a quarter of the class should
be kept back, but teachers are the most
unpredictable creatures on earth.
I’m not so worried about my girlfriends and
myself. We’ll make it. The only subject I’m not sure
about is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until
then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.
I get along pretty well with all my teachers. There
are nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr
Keesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was
annoyed with me for ages because I talked so much.
After several warnings, he assigned me extra
homework. An essay on the subject, ‘A Chatterbox’.
A chatterbox — what can you write about that? I’d
worry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the
title in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried
to keep quiet.
That evening, after I’d finished the rest of my
homework, the note about the essay caught my eye.
I began thinking about the subject while chewing
the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on
and leave big spaces between the words, but the
trick was to come up with convincing arguments to
prove the necessity of talking. I thought and
thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the
three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was
satisfied. I argued that talking is a student’s trait
and that I would do my best to keep it under control,

but that I would never be able to cure myself of the
habit since my mother talked as much as I did if
not more, and that there’s not much you can do
about inherited traits.
Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments,
but when I proceeded to talk my way through the
next lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This
time it was supposed to be on ‘An Incorrigible
Chatterbox’. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had
nothing to complain about for two whole lessons.
However, during the third lesson he’d finally had
enough. “Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in
class, write an essay entitled — ‘Quack, Quack,
Quack, Said Mistress Chatterbox’.”

The class roared. I had to laugh too, though I’d
nearly exhausted my ingenuity on the topic of
chatterboxes. It was time to come up with
something else, something original. My friend,
Sanne, who’s good at poetry, offered to help me write
the essay from beginning to end in verse and I
jumped for joy. Mr Keesing was trying to play a
joke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I’d make
sure the joke was on him.
I finished my poem, and it was beautiful! It was
about a mother duck and a father swan with three
baby ducklings who were bitten to death by the
father because they quacked too much. Luckily, Mr
Keesing took the joke the right way. He read the

Some phrasal verbs have three parts: a verb followed by an adverb and a
preposition.
(c) Our car ran out of petrol just outside the city limits.
(d) The government wants to reach out to the people with this new
campaign.

The text you’ve just read has a number of phrasal verbs commonly
used in English. Look up the following in a dictionary for their
meanings (under the entry for the italicised word).
(i) plunge (right) in
(iii) ramble on
(ii) kept back
(iv) get along with

Now find the sentences in the lesson that have the phrasal verbs
given below. Match them with their meanings. (You have already
found out the meanings of some of them.) Are their meanings the
same as that of their parts? (Note that two parts of a phrasal verb
may occur separated in the text.)
(i) plunge in
– speak or write without focus
(ii) kept back
– stay indoors
(iii) move up
– make (them) remain quiet
(iv) ramble on
– have a good relationship with
(v) get along with
– give an assignment (homework) to a person in
authority (the teacher)
(vi) calm down
– compensate
(vii) stay in
– go straight to the topic
(viii) make up for
– go to the next grade
(ix) hand in
– not promoted
III. Idioms
Idioms are groups of words with a fixed order, and a particular meaning,
different from the meanings of each of their words put together. (Phrasal
verbs can also be idioms; they are said to be ‘idiomatic’ when their meaning
is unpredictable.) For example, do you know what it means to ‘meet one’s
match’ in English? It means to meet someone who is as good as oneself, or
even better, in some skill or quality. Do you know what it means to ‘let the
cat out of the bag’? Can you guess?
1.
Here are a few sentences from the text which have idiomatic
expressions. Can you say what each means? (You might want to
consult a dictionary first.)
(i) Our entire class is quaking in its boots. 
(ii) Until then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.

• Ability to See 3 [sing.] the ability to see: A surgeon needs a good eye

• Way of Seeing 4 [C, usually sing.] a particular way of seeing sth: He

• Of Needle 5 [C] the hole in the end of a needle that you put the thread

IDM be all eyes to be watching sb/sth carefully and with a lot of interest

(iv) Mr Keesing was trying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous
subject, but I’d make sure the joke was on him. 
2.
Here are a few more idiomatic expressions that occur in the text.
Try to use them in sentences of your own.
(i) caught my eye
(iii) laugh ourselves silly
(ii) he’d had enough
(iv) can’t bring myself to
IV. Do you know how to use a dictionary to find out the meanings of idiomatic
expressions? Take, for example, the expression caught my eye in the story.
Where — under which word — would you look for it in the dictionary?
Look for it under the first word. But if the first word is a ‘grammatical’ word
like a, the, for, etc., then take the next word. That is, look for the first
‘meaningful’ word in the expression. In our example, it is the word caught.
But you won’t find caught in the dictionary, because it is the past tense of
catch. You’ll find caught listed under catch. So you must look under catch for
the expression caught my eye. Which other expressions with catch are listed
in your dictionary?
Note that a dictionary entry usually first gives the meanings of the word
itself, and then gives a list of idiomatic expressions using that word. For
example, study this partial entry for the noun ‘eye’ from the Oxford Advanced
Learner’s Dictionary, 2005.

You have read the expression ‘not to lose heart’ in this text. Now find
out the meanings of the following expressions using the word ‘heart’.Use
each of them in a sentence of your own.

2.
close/dear to heart
3.
from the (bottom of your) heart
4.
have a heart
5.
have a heart of stone
6.
your heart goes out to somebody
V. Contracted Forms
When we speak, we use ‘contracted forms’ or short forms such as these:
can’t (for can not or cannot)
I’d  (for I would or I had)
she’s (for she is)
Notice that contracted forms are also written with an apostrophe to show a
shortening of the spelling of not, would, or is as in the above example.
Writing a diary is like speaking to oneself. Plays (and often, novels) also have
speech in written form. So we usually come across contracted forms in
diaries, plays and novels.
1.
Make a list of the contracted forms in the text. Rewrite them as full
forms of two words.
For example:
I’ve = I have
2.
We have seen that some contracted forms can stand for two different
full forms:
I’d = I had or I would
Find in the text the contracted forms that stand for two different
full forms, and say what these are.
Here is an extract adapted from a one-act play. In this extract, angry neighbours
who think Joe the Inventor’s new spinning machine will make them lose their
jobs come to destroy Joe’s model of the machine.
You’ve just seen how contracted forms can make a written text sound like actual
speech. Try to make this extract sound more like a real conversation by changing
some of the verbs back into contracted forms. Then speak out the lines.

Now you know what a diary is and how to keep one. Can you keep a diary for a
week recording the events that occur? You may share your diary with your
class, if you wish to. Use the following hints to write your diary.
•
Though your diary is very private, write as if you are writing for someone else.
•
Present your thoughts in a convincing manner.
•
Use words that convey your feelings, and words that ‘paint pictures’ for the
reader. Be brief.
‘Diary language’ has some typical features such as subjectless sentences (Got
up late in the morning), sentence fragments without subjects or verbs (…too
bad, boring, not good), contracted forms (they’re, I’ve, can’t, didn’t, etc.),  and
everyday expressions which people use  in speech. Remember not to use such
language in more formal kinds of writing.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE
1.
Diary writing is one of the best ways to practise writing. Students do not have to
think up or imagine what to write about; they only have to find words to write
about what has happened.  Initiate your students into the habit of keeping a diary.
2.
Anne Frank’s diary became a public document after World War II. Discuss with your
students diaries which became historical documents, such as Samuel Pepys’s diary.
You may draw students’ attention to different types of diaries, e.g. private diary,
general diary. Army officers, businessmen, doctors, executives, lawyers, motorists,
police officers keep a general diary  to record events that happen during the day
and events that are scheduled for the day, such as appointments, meetings, things
to be done, etc.
3.
Passage for listening exercise:
The Great Fire of London [1666]
September 2nd (Lord’s Day). Jane called us up about three in the morning,
to tell us of a great fire they saw in the city. So I rose and slipped on my
nightgown, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the backside
of Marke-Lane at the farthest; but being unused to such fire as followed,
I thought it far enough off, and so went to bed again and to sleep.
About seven rose again to dress myself, and then looked out of the
window, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. By and by
Jane comes and tells me that she hears that above 300 houses have
been burned down tonight by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning
down all Fish Street, by London Bridge.
So I made myself ready presently, and walked to the Tower, and there got
up upon one of the high places, Sir J. Robinson’s little son going up with
me; and there I did see the houses at that end of the bridge all on fire,
and an infinite great fire on this and the other side of the bridge.
[From The Diary of Samuel Pepys ]
WHAT YOU CAN DO
After they have completed the lesson, including the writing exercise, students can be
asked to make a diary jotting for the previous day. Perhaps you could also write a diary
entry describing what happened in school/class on the previous day, to share with the
class — try and make it amusing and interesting! Collect students’ pages (they may be
allowed to sign their names or make it anonymous, as they wish) and put them up on
the class notice board, together with your page, for everyone to read.

OUR elders are often heard reminiscing nostalgically
about those good old Portuguese days, the Portuguese
and their famous loaves of bread. Those eaters of loaves
might have vanished but the makers are still there.
We still have amongst us the mixers, the moulders
and those who bake the loaves. Those age-old, time-
tested furnaces still exist. The fire in the furnaces

the traditional baker’s bamboo, heralding his arrival
in the morning, can still be heard in some places.
Maybe the father is not alive but the son still carries
on the family profession. These bakers are, even today,
known as pader in Goa.
During our childhood in Goa, the baker used to
be our friend, companion and guide. He used to
come at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in
the morning on his selling round, and then again,
when he returned after emptying his huge basket.
The jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from
sleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was
it so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The
loaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine,
the maid-servant of the house! What we longed for
were those bread-bangles which we chose carefully.
Sometimes it was sweet bread of special make.
The baker made his musical entry on the scene
with the ‘jhang, jhang’ sound of his specially made
bamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on
his head and the other banged the bamboo on the
ground. He would greet the lady of the house with
“Good morning” and then place his basket on the
vertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed aside
with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered
to the servant. But we would not give up. We would
climb a bench or the parapet and peep into the
basket, somehow. I can still recall the typical
fragrance of those loaves. Loaves for the elders and
the bangles for the children. Then we did not even
care to brush our teeth or wash our mouths
properly. And why should we? Who would take the
trouble of plucking the mango-leaf for the
toothbrush? And why was it necessary at all? The
tiger never brushed his teeth. Hot tea could wash
and clean up everything so nicely, after all!

Marriage gifts are meaningless without the sweet
bread known as the bol, just as a party or a feast
loses its charm without bread. Not enough can be
said to show how important a baker can be for a
village. The lady of the house must prepare
sandwiches on the occasion of her daughter’s
engagement. Cakes and bolinhas are a must for
Christmas as well as other festivals. Thus, the
presence of the baker’s furnace in the village is
absolutely essential.
The baker or bread-seller of those days had a
peculiar dress known as the kabai. It was a single-
piece long frock reaching down to the knees. In our
childhood we saw bakers wearing a shirt and
trousers which were shorter than full-length ones
and longer than half pants. Even today, anyone
who wears a half pant which reaches just below
the knees invites the comment that he is dressed
like a pader!
The baker usually collected his bills at the end
of the month. Monthly accounts used to be recorded
on some wall in pencil. Baking was indeed a
profitable profession in the old days. The baker and
his family never starved. He, his family and his
servants always looked happy and prosperous. Their
plump physique was an open testimony to this. Even
today any person with a jackfruit-like physical
appearance is easily compared to a baker.

After Goa’s liberation, people used
to say nostalgically that the
Portuguese bread vanished with
the paders. But the paders have
managed to survive because they
have perfected the art of door-to-
door delivery service. The paders
pick up the knowledge of bread-
making from traditions in the
family. The leavened, oven-baked
bread is a gift of the Portuguese
to India.

Coorg
Coorg is coffee country, famous for its rainforests and spices.
MIDWAY between Mysore and the coastal town of
Mangalore sits a piece of heaven that must have
drifted from the kingdom of god. This land of rolling
hills is inhabited by a proud race of martial men,
beautiful women and wild creatures.
Coorg, or Kodagu, the smallest district of
Karnataka, is home to evergreen rainforests, spices
and coffee plantations.  Evergreen rainforests cover
thirty per cent of this district. During the monsoons,
it pours enough to keep many visitors away. The
season of joy commences from September and
continues till March. The weather is perfect, with
some showers thrown in for
good measure. The air
breathes of invigorating
coffee. Coffee estates and
colonial bungalows stand
tucked under tree canopies
in prime corners.
The fiercely independent
people of Coorg are possibly
of Greek or Arabic descent.
As one story goes, a part of
Alexander’s army moved
south along the coast and
settled here when return
became impractical. These
people married amongst the
locals and their culture is
apparent in the martial
traditions, marriage and
religious rites, which are

Known as kuppia, it resembles the kuffia worn by
the Arabs and the Kurds.
Coorgi homes have a tradition of hospitality, and
they are more than willing to recount numerous
tales of valour related to their sons and fathers.
The Coorg Regiment is one of the most decorated in
the Indian Army, and the first Chief of the Indian
Army, General Cariappa, was a Coorgi. Even now,
Kodavus are the only people in India permitted to

The river, Kaveri, obtains its water from the hills
and forests of Coorg.  Mahaseer — a large freshwater
fish — abound in these waters. Kingfishers dive for
their catch, while squirrels and langurs drop

Tea from Assam
Pranjol, a youngster from Assam, is Rajvir’s classmate at school
in Delhi. Pranjol’s father is the manager of a tea-garden in Upper
Assam and Pranjol has invited Rajvir to visit his home during the
summer vacation.
“CHAI-GARAM... garam-chai,” a vendor called out in  a
high-pitched voice.
He came up to their window and asked,”Chai, sa’ab?”
“Give us two cups,” Pranjol said.
They sipped the steaming hot liquid. Almost
everyone in their compartment was drinking tea too.
“Do you know that over eighty crore cups of tea
are drunk every day throughout the world?” Rajvir said.
“Whew!” exclaimed Pranjol. “Tea really is very
popular.”
The train pulled out of the station. Pranjol buried
his nose in his detective book again. Rajvir too was
an ardent fan of detective stories, but at the moment
he was keener on looking at the beautiful scenery.
It was green, green everywhere. Rajvir had never
seen so much greenery before. Then the soft green
paddy fields gave way to tea bushes.
It was a magnificent view. Against the backdrop
of densely wooded hills a sea of tea bushes stretched
as far as the eye could see. Dwarfing the tiny tea
plants were tall sturdy shade-trees and amidst the
orderly rows of bushes busily moved doll-like figures.

In the distance was an ugly building with smoke
billowing out of tall chimneys.
“Hey, a tea garden!” Rajvir cried excitedly.
Pranjol, who had been born and brought up on
a plantation, didn’t share Rajvir’s excitement.
“Oh, this is tea country now,” he said. “Assam has
the largest concentration of plantations in the world.
You will see enough gardens to last you a lifetime!”
“I have been reading as much as I could about
tea,” Rajvir said. “No one really knows who
discovered tea but there are many legends.”
“What legends?”
“Well, there’s the one about the Chinese emperor
who always boiled water before drinking it. One
day a few leaves of the twigs burning under the pot
fell into the water giving it a delicious flavour. It is
said they were tea leaves.”
“Tell me another!” scoffed Pranjol.
“We have an Indian legend too. Bodhidharma, an
ancient Buddhist ascetic, cut off his eyelids because
he felt sleepy during meditations. Ten tea plants
grew out of the eyelids. The leaves of these plants
when put in hot water and drunk banished sleep.
“Tea was first drunk in China,” Rajvir added,
“as far back as 2700 B.C.! In fact words such as
tea, ‘chai’ and ‘chini’ are from Chinese. Tea came to
Europe only in the sixteenth century and was drunk
more as medicine than as beverage.”
The train clattered into Mariani junction. The
boys collected their luggage and pushed their way
to the crowded platform.
Pranjol’s parents were waiting for them.
Soon they were driving towards Dhekiabari, the
tea-garden managed by Pranjol’s father.
An hour later the car veered sharply off the main
road. They crossed a cattle-bridge and entered
Dhekiabari Tea Estate.
On both sides of the gravel-road were acre upon
acre of tea bushes, all neatly pruned to the same
height. Groups of tea-pluckers, with bamboo baskets
on their backs, wearing plastic aprons, were
plucking the newly sprouted leaves.

used for ‘interior decoration’ in cities while forests are cut down, are
‘imprisoned’, and need to ‘break out’?

metaphor for human beings; this is a recurrent image in her poetry.
What new meanings emerge from the poem if you take its trees to be

Do you have a pet? If you do, you perhaps know that a pet is a
serious responsibility. Read in the box below what the SPCA —
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals — has to
say about how to care for a pet.
Owning a pet is a lifetime of commitment (up to ten years or
more if you own a dog or a cat) involving considerable
responsibility. The decision to acquire one, therefore, should
be made by the whole family. Without full agreement by
everyone, the pet could end up unwanted. Puppies and
kittens are so adorable, it is easy to understand why adults
and children alike would be attracted to them. Unfortunately
their cute looks are often a disadvantage, because people
purchase them without consideration and the knowledge on
how to take proper care of them. The basic points you should
keep in mind before adopting a puppy are:
• an annual dog licence in accordance with government
regulations
• its annual vaccination against major diseases
• toilet training
• regular grooming and bathing

Otters are found in large numbers in the marshes (i.e. wet
areas near lakes, rivers or seas) near Basra, a town in Iraq.
Imagine you wanted to bring an otter from Iraq to London,
as a pet. What special arrangements would you need to
make for your pet otter? You would need to find a place
with lots of water, for example. What other points should
you think about? The information about Iraq and London
given below may help you.
Iraq
Iraq has mostly broad plains
and marshes along the
Iranian border in the south,
with large flooded areas. A
large part of Iraq’s land area
is desert, so it has cool
winters and dry, hot and
cloudless summers. The
mountain areas near Iran
and Turkey have cold winters.
There is heavy snowfall there,
and when the snow melts in
spring, it causes floods in
central and southern Iraq.
London
London 
has 
a 
large
population and is a very busy
city. In addition to multi-
storeyed buildings, however,
it has many open spaces or
parks. It has a temperate
climate (i.e. it is neither very
hot, nor very cold), with
regular but generally light
rainfall or snow throughout
the year. The warmest month
is July, and the coolest
month is January. February
is the driest month. Snow is
not very common in London.
Reading up on the subject beforehand is another
important requirement and will guide you towards being a
responsible pet owner. Selected pet shops and major book
stores provide books on the care of various breeds/pets.

I
EARLY in the New Year of 1956 I travelled to Southern
Iraq. By then it had crossed my mind that I should
like to keep an otter instead of a dog, and that
Camusfearna, ringed by water a stone’s throw from
its door, would be an eminently suitable spot for
this experiment.
When I casually mentioned this to a friend, he
as casually replied that I had better get one in the
Tigris marshes, for there they were as common as
mosquitoes, and were often tamed by the Arabs.
We were going to Basra to the Consulate-General
to collect and answer our mail from Europe. At the
Consulate-General we found that my friend’s mail
had arrived but that mine had not.
I cabled to England, and when, three days later,
nothing had happened, I tried to telephone. The call
had to be booked twenty-four hours in advance. On
the first day the line was out of order; on the second
the exchange was closed for a religious holiday. On
the third day there was another breakdown. My
friend left, and I arranged to meet him in a week’s
time. Five days later, my mail arrived.
I carried it to my bedroom to read, and there,
squatting on the floor, were two Arabs; beside them
lay a sack that squirmed from time to time. They
handed me a note from my friend: “Here is your otter...”
II
With the opening of that sack began a phase of my
life that has not yet ended, and may, for all I know,
not end before I do. It is, in effect, a thraldom to
otters, an otter fixation, that I have since found to
be shared by most other people, who have ever
owned one.
The creature that emerged from this sack on to
the spacious tiled floor of the Consulate bedroom
resembled most of all a very small, medievally-
conceived, dragon. From the head to the tip of the

tail he was coated with symmetrical pointed scales
of mud armour, between whose tips was visible a
soft velvet fur like that of a chocolate-brown mole.
He shook himself, and I half expected a cloud of
dust, but in fact it was not for another month that I
managed to remove the last of the mud and see the
otter, as it were, in his true colours.
Mijbil, as I called the otter, was, in fact, of a
race previously unknown to science, and was at
length christened by zoologists Lutrogale perspicillata
maxwelli, or Maxwell’s otter. For the first twenty-
four hours Mijbil was neither hostile nor friendly;
he was simply aloof and indifferent, choosing to
sleep on the floor as far from my bed as possible.
The second night Mijbil came on to my bed in the
small hours and remained asleep in the crook of
my knees until the servant brought tea in the
morning, and during the day he began to lose his
apathy and take a keen, much too keen, interest in
his surroundings. I made a body-belt for him and
took him on a lead to the bathroom, where for half
an hour he went wild with joy in the water, plunging
and rolling in it, shooting up and down the length
of the bathtub underwater, and making enough slosh
and splash for a hippo. This, I was to learn, is a
characteristic of otters; every drop of water must
be, so to speak, extended and spread about the
place; a bowl must at once be overturned, or, if it
will not be overturned, be sat in and sploshed in
until it overflows. Water must be kept on the move
and made to do things; when static it is wasted
and provoking.

Two days later, Mijbil escaped from my bedroom
as I entered it, and I turned to see his tail
disappearing round the bend of the corridor that
led to the bathroom. By the time I got there he was
up on the end of the bathtub and fumbling at the
chromium taps with his paws. I watched, amazed;
in less than a minute he had turned the tap far
enough to produce a trickle of water, and after a
moment or two achieved the full flow. (He had been
lucky to turn the tap the right way; on later
occasions he would sometimes screw it up still
tighter, chittering with irritation and disappointment
at the tap’s failure to cooperate.)
Very soon Mij would follow me without a lead
and come to me when I called his name. He spent
most of his time in play. He spent hours shuffling a
rubber ball round the room like a four-footed soccer
player using all four feet to dribble the ball, and he
could also throw it, with a powerful flick of the
neck, to a surprising height and distance. But the
real play of an otter is when he lies on his back
and juggles with small objects between his paws.
Marbles were Mij’s favourite toys for this pastime:
he would lie on his back rolling two or more of them
up and down his wide, flat belly without ever
dropping one to the floor.

The days passed peacefully at Basra, but I dreaded
the prospect of transporting Mij to England, and to
Camusfearna. The British airline to London would
not fly animals, so I booked a flight to Paris on
another airline, and from there to London. The
airline insisted that Mij should be packed into a
box not more than eighteen inches square, to be
carried on the floor at my feet. I had a box made,
and an hour before we started, I put Mij into the
box so that he would become accustomed to it, and
left for a hurried meal.
When I returned, there was an appalling
spectacle. There was complete silence from the box,
but from its airholes and chinks around the lid,
blood had trickled and dried. I whipped off the lock
and tore open the lid, and Mij, exhausted and blood-
spattered, whimpered and caught at my leg. He had
torn the lining of the box to shreds; when I removed
the last of it so that there were no cutting edges
left, it was just ten minutes until the time of the
flight, and the airport was five miles distant. I put
the miserable Mij back into the box, holding down
the lid with my hand.
I sat in the back of the car with the box beside
me as the driver tore through the streets of Basra
like a ricochetting bullet. The aircraft was waiting
to take off; I was rushed through to it by infuriated
officials. Luckily, the seat booked for me was at
the extreme front. I covered the floor around my
feet with newspapers, rang for the air hostess,
and gave her a parcel of fish (for Mij) to keep in a
cool place. I took her into my confidence about the
events of the last half hour. I have retained the
most profound admiration for that air hostess; she
was the very queen of her kind. She suggested
that I might prefer to have my pet on my knee, and
I could have kissed her hand in the depth of my
gratitude. But, not knowing otters, I was quite
unprepared for what followed.

Mij was out of the box in a flash. He disappeared
at high speed down the aircraft. There were squawks
and shrieks, and a woman stood up on her seat
screaming out, “A rat! A rat!” I caught sight of Mij’s
tail disappearing beneath the legs of a portly white-
turbaned Indian. Diving for it, I missed, but found
my face covered in curry. “Perhaps,” said the air
hostess with the most charming smile, “it would be
better if you resumed your seat, and I will find the
animal and bring it to you.”
I returned to my seat. I was craning my neck
trying to follow the hunt when suddenly I heard
from my feet a distressed chitter of recognition and
welcome, and Mij bounded on to my knee and began
to nuzzle my face and my neck.

After an eventful journey, Maxwell and his otter reach London, where
he has a flat.
Mij and I remained in London for nearly a month.
He would play for hours with a selection of toys,
ping-pong balls, marbles, rubber fruit, and a
terrapin shell that I had brought back from his native
marshes. With the ping-pong ball he invented a
game of his own which could keep him engrossed
for up to half an hour at a time. A suitcase that I
had taken to Iraq had become damaged on the
journey home, so that the lid, when closed,
remained at a slope from one end to the other. Mij
discovered that if he placed the ball on the high
end it would run down the length of the suitcase.
He would dash around to the other end to ambush
its arrival, hide from it, crouching, to spring up
and take it by surprise, grab it and trot off with it
to the high end once more.
Outside the house I exercised him on a lead,
precisely as if he had been a dog. Mij quickly developed
certain compulsive habits on these walks in the
London streets, like the rituals of children who on
their way to and from school must place their feet
squarely on the centre of each paving block; must
touch every seventh upright of the iron railings, or
pass to the outside of every second lamp post. Opposite
to my flat was a single-storied primary school, along
whose frontage ran a low wall some two feet high. On
his way home, but never on his way out, Mij would
tug me to this wall, jump on to it, and gallop the full
length of its thirty yards, to the hopeless distraction
both of pupils and of staff within.

It is not, I suppose, in any way strange that the
average Londoner should not recognise an otter, but
the variety of guesses as to what kind of animal this
might be came as a surprise to me. Otters belong to
a comparatively small group of animals called
Mustellines, shared by the badger, mongoose, weasel,
stoat, mink and others. I faced a continuous barrage
of conjectural questions that sprayed all the
Mustellines but the otter; more random guesses hit
on ‘a baby seal’ and ‘a squirrel.’ ‘Is that a walrus,
mister?’ reduced me to giggles, and outside a dog
show I heard ‘a hippo’. A beaver, a bear cub, a leopard
— one, apparently, that had changed its spots —
and a ‘brontosaur’; Mij was anything but an otter.
But the question for which I awarded the highest
score came from a labourer digging a hole in the street.
I was still far from him when he laid down his tool,
put his hands on his hips, and began to stare. As I
drew nearer I saw his expression of surprise and
affront, as though he would have me know that he
was not one upon whom to play jokes. I came abreast
of him; he spat, glared, and then growled out, “Here,
Mister — what is that supposed to be?”

THERE was a girl named Valliammai who was called
Valli for short. She was eight years old and very
curious about things. Her favourite pastime was
standing in the front doorway of her house,
watching what was happening in the street outside.
There were no playmates of her own age on her
street, and this was about all she had to do.
But for Valli, standing at the front door was every
bit as enjoyable as any of the elaborate games other
children played. Watching the street gave her many
new unusual experiences.

The most fascinating thing of all was the bus
that travelled between her village and the nearest
town. It passed through her street each hour, once
going to the town and once coming back. The sight
of the bus, filled each time with a new set of
passengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli.
Day after day she watched the bus, and
gradually a tiny wish crept into her head and
grew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even
if just once. This wish became stronger and
stronger, until it was an overwhelming desire.
Valli would stare wistfully at the people who got
on or off the bus when it stopped at the street
corner. Their faces would kindle in her longings,
dreams, and hopes. If one of her friends happened
to ride the bus and tried to describe the sights of
the town to her, Valli would be too jealous to listen
and would shout, in English: “Proud! proud!”
Neither she nor her friends really understood the
meaning of the word, but they used it often as a
slang expression of disapproval.
Over many days and months Valli listened
carefully to conversations between her neighbours
and people who regularly used the bus, and she also
asked a few discreet questions here and there. This
way she picked up various small details about the
bus journey. The town was six miles from her village.
The fare was thirty paise one way — “which is almost
nothing at all,” she heard one well-dressed man say,
but to Valli, who scarcely saw that much money
from one month to the next, it seemed a fortune. The
trip to the town took forty-five minutes. On reaching
town, if she stayed in her seat and paid another
thirty paise, she could return home on the same
bus. This meant that she could take the one-o’clock
afternoon bus, reach the town at one forty-five, and
be back home by about two forty-five...
On and on went her thoughts as she calculated
and recalculated, planned and replanned.

Well, one fine spring day the afternoon bus was
just on the point of leaving the village and turning
into the main highway when a small voice was heard
shouting: “Stop the bus! Stop the bus!” And a tiny
hand was raised commandingly.
The bus slowed down to a crawl, and the
conductor, sticking his head out the door, said,
“Hurry then! Tell whoever it is to come quickly.”
“It’s me,” shouted Valli. “I’m the one who has to
get on.”
By now the bus had come to a stop, and the
conductor said, “Oh, really! You don’t say so!”
“Yes, I simply have to go to town,” said Valli,
still standing outside the bus, “and here’s my
money.” She showed him some coins.
“Okay, okay, but first you must get on the bus,”
said the conductor, and he stretched out a hand to
help her up.
“Never mind,” she said, “I can get on by myself.
You don’t have to help me.”
The conductor was a jolly sort, fond of joking. “Oh,
please don’t be angry with me, my fine madam,” he
said. “Here, have a seat right up there in front.
Everybody move aside please — make way for madam.”
It was the slack time of day, and there were
only six or seven passengers on the bus. They were
all looking at Valli and laughing with the conductor.
Valli was overcome with shyness. Avoiding
everyone’s eyes, she walked quickly to an empty
seat and sat down.

“May we start now, madam?” the conductor
asked, smiling. Then he blew his whistle twice, and
the bus moved forward with a roar.
It was a new bus, its outside painted a gleaming
white with some green stripes along the sides.
Inside, the overhead bars shone like silver. Directly
in front of Valli, above the windshield, there was a
beautiful clock. The seats were soft and luxurious.
Valli devoured everything with her eyes. But
when she  started to look outside, she found her
view cut off by a canvas blind that covered the lower
part of her window. So she stood up on the seat
and peered over the blind.
The bus was now going along the bank of a canal.
The road was very narrow. On one side there was
the canal and, beyond it, palm trees, grassland,
distant mountains, and the blue, blue sky. On the
other side was a deep ditch and then acres and
acres of green fields — green, green, green, as far
as the eye could see.
Oh, it was all so wonderful!
Suddenly she was startled by a voice. “Listen,
child,” said the voice, “you shouldn’t stand like that.
Sit down.”

Sitting down, she looked to see who had spoken.
It was an elderly man who had honestly been
concerned for her, but she was annoyed by
his attention.
“There’s nobody here who’s a child,” she said
haughtily. “I’ve paid my thirty paise like everyone
else.”
The conductor chimed in. “Oh, sir, but this is a
very grown-up madam. Do you think a mere girl
could pay her own fare and travel to the city
all alone?”
Valli shot an angry glance at the conductor and
said, “I am not a madam. Please remember that.
And you’ve not yet given me my ticket.”
“I’ll remember,” the conductor said, mimicking
her tone. Everyone laughed, and gradually Valli too
joined in the laughter.
The conductor punched a ticket and handed it
to her. “Just sit back and make yourself comfortable.
Why should you stand when you’ve paid for a seat?”
“Because I want to,” she answered, standing
up again.
“But if you stand on the seat, you may fall and
hurt yourself when the bus makes a sharp turn
or hits a bump. That’s why we want you to sit
down, child.”
“I’m not a child, I tell you,” she said irritably.
“I’m eight years old.”
“Of course, of course. How stupid of me! Eight
years — my!”
The bus stopped, some new passengers got on,
and the conductor got busy for a time. Afraid of
losing her seat, Valli finally sat down.
An elderly woman came and sat beside her. “Are
you all alone, dear?” she asked Valli as the bus
started again.
Valli found the woman absolutely repulsive — such
big holes she had in her ear lobes, and such ugly
earrings in them! And she could smell the betel nut
the woman was chewing and see the betel juice that
was threatening to spill over her lips at any moment.

Ugh! — who could be sociable with such a person?
“Yes, I’m travelling alone,” she answered curtly.
“And I’ve got a ticket too.”
“Yes, she’s on her way to town,” said the
conductor. “With a thirty-paise ticket.”
“Oh, why don’t you mind your own business,”
said Valli. But she laughed all the same, and the
conductor laughed too.
But the old woman went on with her drivel. “Is
it proper for such a young person to travel alone?
Do you know exactly where you’re going in town?
What’s the street? What’s the house number?”
“You needn’t bother about me. I can take care of
myself,” Valli said, turning her face towards the
window and staring out.

Her first journey — what careful, painstaking,
elaborate plans she had had to make for it! She had
thriftily saved whatever stray coins came her way,
resisting every temptation to buy peppermints, toys,
balloons, and the like, and finally she had saved a
total of sixty paise. How difficult it had been,
particularly that day at the village fair, but she had
resolutely stifled a strong desire to ride the merry-
go-round, even though she had the money.
After she had enough money saved, her next
problem was how to slip out of the house without
her mother’s knowledge. But she managed this
without too much difficulty. Every day after lunch
her mother would nap from about one to four or so.
Valli always used these hours for her ‘excursions’

or sometimes even ventured out into the village;
today, these same hours could be used for her first
excursion outside the village.
The bus rolled on now cutting across a bare
landscape, now rushing through a tiny hamlet or
past an odd wayside shop. Sometimes the bus
seemed on the point of gobbling up another vehicle
that was coming towards them or a pedestrian
crossing the road. But lo! somehow it passed on
smoothly, leaving all obstacles safely behind. Trees
came running towards them but then stopped as
the bus reached them and simply stood there
helpless for a moment by the side of the road before
rushing away in the other direction.
Suddenly Valli clapped her hands with glee. A
young cow, tail high in the air, was running very
fast, right in the middle of the road, right in front
of the bus. The bus slowed to a crawl, and the driver
sounded his horn loudly again and again. But the
more he honked, the more frightened the animal
became and the faster it galloped — always right in
front of the bus.

Somehow this was very funny to Valli. She laughed
and laughed until there were tears in her eyes.
“Hey, lady, haven’t you laughed enough?” called,
the conductor. “Better save some for tomorrow.”
At last the cow moved off the road. And soon the
bus came to a railroad crossing. A speck of a train
could be seen in the distance, growing bigger and
bigger as it drew near. Then it rushed past the
crossing gate with a tremendous roar and rattle,
shaking the bus. Then the bus went on and passed
the train station. From there it traversed a busy,
well-laid-out shopping street and, turning, entered
a wider thoroughfare. Such big, bright-looking
shops! What glittering displays of clothes and other
merchandise! Such big crowds!
Struck dumb with wonder, Valli gaped at everything.
Then the bus stopped and everyone got off
except Valli.
 “Hey, lady,” said the conductor, “aren’t you ready
to get off? This is as far as your thirty paise
takes you.”
“No,” Valli said, “I’m going back on this same
bus.” She took another thirty paise from her pocket
and handed the coins to the conductor.
“Why, is something the matter?”
“No, nothing’s the matter. I just felt like having
a bus ride, that’s all.”
“Don’t you want to have a look at the sights,
now that you’re here?”
“All by myself? Oh, I’d be much too afraid.”
Greatly amused by the girl’s way of speaking,
the conductor said, “But you weren’t afraid to come
in the bus.”
“Nothing to be afraid of about that,” she
answered.
“Well, then, why not go to that stall over there
and have something to drink? Nothing to be afraid
of about that either."
“Oh, no, I couldn’t do that.”
“Well, then, let me bring you a cold drink.”

“No, I don’t have enough money. Just give me

“It’ll be my treat and not cost you anything.”
“No, no,” she said firmly, “please, no.”
The conductor shrugged, and they waited until
it was time for the bus to begin the return journey.
Again there weren’t many passengers.

“Won’t your mother be looking for you?” the
conductor asked when he gave the girl her ticket.
“No, no one will be looking for me,” she said.
The bus started, and again there were the same
wonderful sights.
Valli wasn’t bored in the slightest and greeted
everything with the same excitement she’d felt the
first time. But suddenly she saw a young cow lying
dead by the roadside, just where it had been struck
by some fast-moving vehicle.
“Isn’t that the same cow that ran in front of the
bus on our trip to town?” she asked the conductor.
The conductor nodded, and she was overcome
with sadness. What had been a lovable, beautiful
creature just a little while ago had now suddenly
lost its charm and its life and looked so horrible, so
frightening as it lay there, legs spreadeagled, a fixed
stare in its lifeless eyes, blood all over...
The bus moved on. The memory of the dead cow
haunted her, dampening her enthusiasm. She no
longer wanted to look out the window.
She sat thus, glued to her seat, until the bus
reached her village at three forty. She stood up and

stretched herself. Then she turned to the conductor
and said, “Well, sir, 1 hope to see you again.”
“Okay, madam,” he answered her, smiling.
“Whenever you feel like a bus ride, come and join
us. And don’t forget to bring your fare.”
She laughed and jumped down from the bus.
Then away she went, running straight for home.
When she entered her house she found her
mother awake and talking to one of Valli’s aunts,
the one from South Street. This aunt was a real
chatterbox, never closing her mouth once she
started talking.
“And where have you been?” said her aunt when
Valli came in. She spoke very casually, not expecting
a reply. So Valli just smiled, and her mother and
aunt went on with their conversation.
“Yes, you’re right,” her mother said. “So many
things in our midst and in the world outside. How
can we possibly know about everything? And even
when we do know about something, we often can’t
understand it completely, can we?”
“Oh, yes!” breathed Valli.
“What?” asked her mother. “What’s that you say?”
“Oh,” said Valli, “I was just agreeing with what
you said about things happening without our
knowledge.”
“Just a chit of a girl, she is,” said her aunt, “and
yet look how she pokes her nose into our conversation,
just as though she were a grown lady.”
Valli smiled to herself. She didn’t want them to
understand her smile. But, then, there wasn’t much
chance of that, was there?

The students should be given two or three days to collect old (used) tickets from
their friends, relatives and acquaintances: they could be bus tickets, train tickets,
plane tickets, cinema tickets, tickets to cultural events, etc.  By the time they finish
the lesson they should be able to get a good collection in place. Get them to make
a collage using as many as possible of the tickets collected, on a sheet of poster
paper. This can then form the basis for many interesting activities: classification
according to type of tickets (for what?) or price (how much?), etc; the most desirable
tickets, the tickets no one wants, etc. — let students think of more ways to classify
them. Get students to write a paragraph with the collage as base, and their
imagination as guide.
2.
You can also ask the students do the following.
(i) In the story Valli has to save money and  make plans to be able to ride the
bus.  In pairs, discuss how you spent your pocket money last month.  Did you
spend it on yourself, or on someone dear to you?
(ii) Valli's enthusiasm is dampened and the memory of the dead cow haunts her.
In groups, discuss an incident which may have troubled or discouraged you.

The Tale of Custard
the Dragon
This poem is written in the style of a ballad — a song
or poem that tells a story. You must be familiar with ballads that
narrate tales of courage or heroism. This poem is a humorous
ballad close to a parody.
Read it aloud, paying attention to the rhythm.
Belinda lived in a little white house,
With a little black kitten and a little grey mouse,
And a little yellow dog and a little red wagon,
And a realio, trulio, little pet dragon.
Now the name of the little black kitten was Ink,
And the little grey mouse, she called him Blink,
And the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard,
But the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard.
Custard the dragon had big sharp teeth,
And spikes on top of him and scales underneath,
Mouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose,
And realio, trulio daggers on his toes.
Belinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears,
And Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs,
Mustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage,
But Custard cried for a nice safe cage.
Reprint 2025-26
Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful,
Ink, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival,
They all sat laughing in the little red wagon
At the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon.
Belinda giggled till she shook the house,
And Blink said Weeck! which is giggling for a mouse,
Ink and Mustard rudely asked his age,
When Custard cried for a nice safe cage.
Suddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound,
And Mustard growled, and they all looked around.
Meowch! cried Ink, and ooh! cried Belinda,
For there was a pirate, climbing in the winda.
Pistol in his left hand, pistol in his right,
And he held in his teeth a cutlass bright,
His beard was black, one leg was wood;
It was clear that the pirate meant no good.
Belinda paled, and she cried Help! Help!
But Mustard fled with a terrified yelp,
Ink trickled down to the bottom of the household,
And little mouse Blink strategically mouseholed.
But up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine,
Clashed his tail like irons in a dungeon,
With a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm,
He went at the pirate like a robin at a worm.
The pirate gaped at Belinda’s dragon,
And gulped some grog from his pocket flagon,
He fired two bullets, but they didn’t hit,
And Custard gobbled him, every bit.

Reprint 2025-26
Belinda embraced him, Mustard licked him,
No one mourned for his pirate victim.
Ink and Blink in glee did gyrate
Around the dragon that ate the pirate.
But presently up spoke little dog Mustard,
I’d have been twice as brave if I hadn’t been flustered.
And up spoke Ink and up spoke Blink,
We’d have been three times as brave, we think,
And Custard said, I quite agree
That everybody is braver than me.
Belinda still lives in her little white house,
With her little black kitten and her little grey mouse,
And her little yellow dog and her little red wagon,
And her realio, trulio little pet dragon.
Belinda is as brave as a barrel full of bears,
And Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs,
Mustard is as brave as a tiger in a rage,
But Custard keeps crying for a nice safe cage.
OGDEN NASH
Ogden Nash wrote over four hundred pieces of comic verse. The
best of his work was published in 14 volumes between 1931 and
1972. His work is perhaps best described in this poetic tribute by
Anthony Burgess:
...he brought a new kind of sound to our literary diversions.
And didn’t care much about breaking the poetic laws of the Medes
and the Persians.
He uses lines, sometimes of considerable length that are colloquial
and prosy.
And at the end presents you with a rhyme...
This bringing together of the informal and the formal is what his
genius chiefly loves.
I am trying to imitate him here, but he is probably quite inimitable.

Foreword
THE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005,
recommends that children’s life at school must be linked
to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which
continues to shape our system and causes a gap between
the school, home and community. The syllabi and
textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt
to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction
of a child-centered system of education outlined in the
National Policy of Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that
school principals and teachers will take to encourage
children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue
imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise
that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to
them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the
sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why
other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive
and treat children as participants in learning, not as
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school
routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily
time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the
annual calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used
for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective
this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a
happy experience, rather than a source of stress or
boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the
problem of curricular burden by restructuring and
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater
Reprint 2025-26
consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this
endeavour by giving higher priority and space to
opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring
hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and
Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the
textbook development committee responsible for this book.
We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group
in languages, Professor Namwar Singh, and the Chief
Advisor for this book, Professor R. Amritavalli, for guiding
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed
to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the
institutions and organisations which have generously
permitted us to draw upon their resources, materials and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of
the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the
Department of Secondary and Higher Education,
Ministry of Human Resource Development under the
Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and
Professor G.P. Deshpande for their valuable time
and contribution. As an organisation committed to
systemic reform and continuous improvement in the
quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and
suggestions which will enable us to undertake further
revision and refinements.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT
IN THE TEXTBOOKS
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to
reduce content load on students. The National
Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the
content load and providing opportunities for
experiential learning with creative mindset. In this
background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise
to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning
Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across
classes have been taken into consideration in this
exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised
in view of the following:
•
Content based on genres of literature in the
textbooks and supplementary readers at
different stages of school education
•
Content that is meant for achieving Learning
Outcomes for developing language proficiency
and is accessible at different stages
•
For reducing the curriculum load and
examination stress in view of the previling
condition of the Pandemic
•
Content, which is easily accessible to students
without much interventions from teachers and
can be learned by children through self-learning
or peer-learning
•
Content, which is irrelevant in the present
context
This present edition, is a reformatted version
after carrying out the changes given above.

providing a variety of rich, comprehensible inputs to
learners to enable their engagement in learning; and
on recognising the multilinguality of everyday
experience in India. This textbook aims at helping the
learner to read for meaning in context, thus providing
a bank of language to serve as a base for

genres, including the diary, the formal address, the
travelogue, and the play, on literary, cultural and
sociological themes that touch upon aspects of life
relevant to adolescents. Questions and ideas about
the individual and society, the understanding and
management of one’s emotions, and of one’s place
in a larger time and space, are here presented both
by such voices from contemporary history as Nelson
Mandela and Anne Frank, and in fiction from India
and abroad, chosen for their enduring value. There
are units that present glimpses of our country, and
depict our relationship with the natural world.
• The units in the book have been loosely structured
in the following way. An introductory section, Before
You Read, gives information or activates knowledge
about the text to be read, and suggests some warm-
up activities. Let children participate in these to the
fullest extent; where necessary or possible, add some
activities of your own.
• An innovation made in consultation with teachers is a
while-reading activity, the Oral Comprehension Check,
which aims at a quick, ongoing check that learners are
indeed following the text up to that point, so that they
can progress meaningfully to the parts of the text that
To the Teacher
Reprint 2025-26
follow. Let learners briefly share their understanding by
orally answering the questions in this section.
Reflection, expression of individual opinion and deeper
understanding of the text can occur later, when the text
has been read and understood in its totality, in the section
Thinking about the Text. The questions in the latter
section are designed to enable the learner to move from
factual understanding to critical thinking. 
• Thinking about Language provides exercises or tasks
that follow naturally from the contexts suggested by a
particular unit, for enrichment of vocabulary and other
language skills. Exploit them well and also create your
own activities. Exercises for the communicative skills of
listening, speaking, and writing have been given in
contexts that support group or pair activity. A variety of
writing tasks have been aimed at.
• While dealing with poems, let children understand and
enjoy the theme and the language by reading a poem with
close attention, more than once, silently or along with the
teacher or a partner. Where some information has been
provided about the poet or the background to the poem,
this should not stand in the way of the learner accessing
the poem directly, and attempting to make sense of it. 
How do we read poetry? Here is what one teacher says.
All poetry requires patience. Be patient with the text;
read carefully for nuance and inference. Know what the
words mean. Look up words that are unfamiliar — look
up words that are familiar but you cannot specify. Pay
attention to words or phrases that resonate with other
things you know and try to identify the connection. Be
patient and read slowly, and you will be amply rewarded.
• Each unit includes some guidelines for your assistance,
under the head In This Lesson, organised under two
subsections — What We Have Done, and What You Can
Do. The first subsection summarises the theme of the unit,
and/or its activities. The second suggests interesting
possibilities for you to go beyond the text, using the text as
a springboard for a variety of language activities appropriate
to your particular group of learners. Suggested here, for
example, are group activities for speaking or making a ticket
collage, as well as dictation. As you follow these suggestions
and take these activities forward along your own lines, you
will be able to enrich your students’ learning.

GAUTAMA Buddha (563 B.C. – 483 B.C.) began life as a
prince named Siddhartha Gautama, in northern
India. At twelve, he was sent away for schooling in
the Hindu sacred scriptures and four years later he
returned home to marry a princess. They had a son
and lived for ten years as befitted royalty. At about
the age of twenty-five, the Prince, heretofore shielded
from the sufferings of the world, while out hunting
chanced upon a sick man, then an aged man, then
a funeral procession, and finally a monk begging
for alms. These sights so moved him that he at
once went out into the world to seek enlightenment
concerning the sorrows he had witnessed.

until enlightenment came. Enlightened after seven
days, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of
Wisdom) and began to teach and to share his new
understandings. At that point he became known as
the Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The
Buddha preached his first sermon at the city of
Benares, most holy of the dipping places on the River
Ganges; that sermon has been preserved and is given
here. It reflects the Buddha’s wisdom about one
inscrutable kind of suffering.
Kisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief
she carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking
them for medicine, and the people said, “She has lost
her senses. The boy is dead.”
At length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her
request, “I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I
know a physician who can.”
And the girl said, “Pray tell me, sir; who is it?” And
the man replied, "Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.”
Kisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, “Lord
and Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.”
The Buddha answered, “I want a handful of mustard-
seed.” And  when the girl in her joy  promised to procure
it, the Buddha added, “The mustard-seed must be taken
from a  house where no one has lost a child, husband,
parent or friend.”
Poor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house,
and the people pitied her and said, “Here is mustard-
seed; take it!” But when she asked, “Did a son or
daughter, a father or mother, die in your family?” they
answered her, “Alas! the living are few, but the dead are
many. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.” And there
was no house but some beloved one had died in it.
Kisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat
down at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as
they flickered up and were extinguished again. At last
the darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she
considered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up
and are extinguished again. And she thought to herself,
“How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all;
yet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads
him to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.”
The Buddha said, ‘‘The life of mortals in this world
is troubled and brief and combined with pain. For there

is not any means by which those that have been born
can avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death; of
such a nature are living beings. As ripe fruits are early
in danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in
danger of death. As all earthen vessels made by the
potter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. Both
young and adult, both those who are fools and those
who are wise, all fall into the power of death; all are
subject to death.
“Of those who, overcome by death, depart from life,
a father cannot save his son, nor kinsmen their relations.
Mark! while relatives are looking on and lamenting
deeply, one by one mortals are carried off, like an ox
that is led to the slaughter. So the world is afflicted  with
death and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve,
knowing the terms of the world.
“Not from weeping nor from grieving will anyone
obtain peace of mind; on the contrary, his pain will be
the greater and his body will suffer. He will make himself
sick and pale, yet the dead are not saved by his
lamentation. He who seeks peace should draw out the
arrow of lamentation, and complaint, and grief. He who
has drawn out the arrow and has become composed
will obtain peace of mind; he who has overcome all
sorrow will become free from sorrow, and be blessed.”

Martha is having difficulty sleeping lately and no longer enjoys doing things
with her friends. Martha lost her husband of 26 years to cancer a month ago.
Anya, age 17, doesn’t feel like eating and spends the days in her room
crying. Her grandmother recently died.

The Sermon at Benares
Feelings of Grief
Although grief is unique and personal, a broad range of feelings and
behaviours are commonly experienced after the death of a loved one.
•
Sadness. This is the most common, and it is not necessarily manifested
by crying.
•
Anger. This is one of the most confusing feelings for a survivor. There
may be frustration at not being able to prevent the death, and a sense
of not being able to exist without the loved one.
•
Guilt and Self-reproach. People may believe that they were not kind
enough or caring enough to the person who died, or that the person
should have seen the doctor sooner.
•
Anxiety. An individual may fear that she/he won’t be able to care for
herself/himself.
•
Loneliness. There are reminders throughout the day that a partner,
family member or friend is gone. For example, meals are no longer
prepared the same way, phone calls to share a special moment don’t
happen.
•
Fatigue. There is an overall sense of feeling tired.
•
Disbelief: This occurs particularly if it was a sudden death.
Helping Others Who Are Experiencing Grief
When a friend, loved one, or co-worker is experiencing grief—how can we
help? It helps to understand that grief is expressed through a variety of
behaviours.
Reach out to others in their grief, but understand that some may not
want to accept help and will not share their grief. Others will want to
talk about their thoughts and feelings or reminisce.
Be patient and let the grieving person know that you care and are
there to support him or her.
II. Good Grief
AMITAI ETZIONI
Soon after my wife died — her car slid off an icy road in 1985 — a school
psychologist warned me that my children and I were not mourning in the
right way. We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial.
In late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his
sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child.
There is no set form for grief, and no ‘right’ way to express it. There
seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress
systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are
told, to jump to anger — or to wallow too long in this stage before moving
towards acceptance.

But I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong;
to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel
beyond words.
A relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by
citing the maxim: ‘We are not to ask why, but what.’ The ‘what’ is that which
survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my
family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long
answers to simple questions like, “How did your day go today?” We try to
avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take
turns playing with Max, Michael’s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights
with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the
baby is born.
Focusing on what we do for one another is the only consolation we
can find.

The Sermon at Benares
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed
out with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only
that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in
truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow
is the greater.”
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board,
remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.

This poem is a conversation between a young man and a young
woman. What are they arguing about?
“Never shall a young man,
Thrown into despair
By those great honey-coloured
Ramparts at your ear,
Love you for yourself alone
And not your yellow hair.”
“But I can get a hair-dye
And set such colour there,
Brown, or black, or carrot,
That young men in despair
May love me for myself alone
And not my yellow hair.”

But yesternight declare
That he had found a text to prove
That only God, my dear,
Could love you for yourself alone
And not your yellow hair.”

Are some people ‘more lovable’ than others? Discuss this question in pairs

(i) a parent or caregiver’s love for a newborn baby, for a mentally or
physically challenged child, for a clever child or a prodigy
(ii) the public’s love for a film star, a sportsperson, a politician, or a social
worker
(iii) your love for a friend, or brother or sister
(iv) your love for a pet, and the pet’s love for you.

You have perhaps concluded that people are not objects to be valued for
their qualities or riches rather than for themselves. But elsewhere Yeats
asks the question: How can we separate the dancer from the dance? Is it
possible to separate ‘the person himself or herself’ from how the person
looks, sounds, walks, and so on? Think of how you or a friend or member of
your family has changed over the years. Has your relationship also changed?

A Russian Wedding
Do you know anything about a Russian marriage ceremony?
Read this article about a Russian wedding.
Preparations for a  Russian Wedding: A Russian wedding
is very simple. The planning only includes arranging for
rings, brides’ dress, cars, and a reception. Earlier, the bride’s
family paid for the reception, but now-a-days brides’ and
grooms’ families usually share expenses. A Russian wedding
lasts for two days; some weddings last as long as a week,
and the occasion becomes something to remember for years.
The necessary part of the wedding ceremony is a wedding
procession of several cars. The best friends of the groom/
bride meet before the wedding a few times, make posters,
write speeches and organise contests. When the groom
arrives to fetch the bride for the registration, he has to fight
to get her! Russians usually live in apartments in tall
buildings, and the groom has to climb several stairs to reach
his bride. But at each landing he must answer a question
to be allowed to go up. The bride’s friends ask difficult
questions (sometimes about the bride, sometimes just
difficult riddles), and the groom must answer with the help
of his friends. For example, he may be shown a few photos
of baby girls and he must say which one his bride is. If he
guesses wrong, he must pay cash to move ahead. After the

marriage registration, the newly-married couple leaves the
guests for a tour of the city sights. After two or three hours
of the city tour the couple arrives at the reception. The couple
sits at a specially arranged table with their family, friends
and invited guests. The reception starts with toasts to the
couple. A wedding toast is a custom where a close friend or
relative of the groom or the bride says a few words to wish
the couple, then everyone raises their glass of wine, and
drink it up at the same moment. The groom is then asked to
kiss the bride. After a few toasts, people start eating and
drinking, and generally have fun. After some time, the bride
gets ‘stolen’! She disappears, and when the groom starts
looking for her, he is asked to pay a fee. Usually it is his
friends who ‘steal’ the bride. Then there are the bride’s
friends — they steal the bride’s shoe. The groom must pay
money for the shoe too. The guests enjoy watching these
tussles, and continue partying.

Do you think Indian and Russian weddings have any customs
in common? With the help of a partner, fill in the table below.
‘‘The Proposal’’ (originally titled ‘‘A Marriage Proposal’’) is a one-
act play, a farce, by the Russian short story writer and dramatist
Anton Chekhov.  It was written in 1888–89.
The play is about the tendency of wealthy families to seek ties
with other wealthy families, to increase their estates by encouraging
marriages that make good economic sense. Ivan Lomov, a long time
wealthy neighbour of Stepan Chubukov, also wealthy, comes to
seek the hand of Chubukov’s twenty-five-year-old daughter, Natalya.
All three are quarrelsome people, and they quarrel over petty issues.
The proposal is in danger of being forgotten amidst all this
quarrelling. But economic good sense ensures that the proposal is
made, after all — although the quarrelling perhaps continues!

CHUBUKOV : [joyfully] By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again — I
didn’t hear it all!
LOMOV
: I have the honour to ask...
CHUBUKOV : [interrupting] My dear fellow... I’m so glad, and so on...
Yes, indeed, and all that sort of thing. [Embraces and kisses
Lomov] I’ve been hoping for it for a long time. It’s been my
continual desire. [Sheds a tear] And I’ve always loved you,
my angel, as if you were my own son. May God give you
both — His help and His love and so on, and so much
hope... What am I behaving in this idiotic way for? I’m off
my balance with joy, absolutely off my balance! Oh, with
all my soul... I’ll go and call Natasha, and all that.
LOMOV
: [greatly moved] Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you
think I may count on her consent?
CHUBUKOV : Why, of course, my darling, and... as if she won’t consent!
She’s in love; egad, she’s like a lovesick cat, and so on.
Shan’t be long!
[Exit.]
LOMOV
: It’s cold... I’m trembling all over, just as if I’d got an
examination before me. The great thing is, I must have
my mind made up. If I give myself time to think, to
hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for an ideal, or for real
love, then I’ll never get married. Brr... It’s cold! Natalya

Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking,
well-educated. What more do I want? But I’m getting a
noise in my ears from excitement. [Drinks] And it’s
impossible for me not to marry. In the first place, I’m
already 35 — a critical age, so to speak. In the second
place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life. I suffer
from palpitations, I’m excitable and always getting
awfully upset; at this very moment my lips are trembling,
and there’s a twitch in my right eyebrow. But the very
worst of all is the way I sleep. I no sooner get into bed
and begin to go off, when suddenly something in my left
side gives a pull, and I can feel it in my shoulder and
head... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit and lie
down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep
there’s another pull! And this may happen twenty times...
[Natalya Stepanovna comes in.]
NATLYA
: Well, there! It’s you, and papa said, “Go; there’s a
merchant come for his goods.” How do you do, Ivan
Vassilevitch?
LOMOV
: How do you do, honoured Natalya Stepanovna?
NATALYA
: You must excuse my apron and neglige. We’re shelling
peas for drying. Why haven’t you been here for such a
long time? Sit down... [They seat themselves.] Won’t you
have some lunch?
LOMOV
: No, thank you, I’ve had some already.
NATALYA
: Then smoke. Here are the matches. The weather is
splendid now, but yesterday it was so wet that the workmen
didn’t do anything all day. How much hay have you
stacked? Just think, I felt greedy and had a whole field
cut, and now I’m not at all pleased about it because I’m
afraid my hay may rot. I ought to have waited a bit. But
what’s this? Why, you’re in evening dress! Well, I never!
Are you going to a ball or what? Though I must say you
look better... Tell me, why are you got up like that?
LOMOV
: [excited] You see, honoured Natalya Stepanovna... the
fact is, I’ve made up my mind to ask you to hear me out...
Of course you’ll be surprised and perhaps even angry,
but a... [aside] It’s awfully cold!

had the privilege of knowing your family. My late aunt
and her husband, from whom, as you know, I inherited
my land, always had the greatest respect for your father
and your late mother. The Lomovs and the Chubukovs
have always had the most friendly, and I might almost
say the most affectionate, regard for each other. And, as
you know, my land is a near neighbour of yours. You will
remember that my Oxen Meadows touch your birchwoods.
NATALYA
: Excuse my interrupting you. You say, “my Oxen Meadows”.
But are they yours?
LOMOV
: Yes, mine.
NATALYA
: What are you talking about? Oxen Meadows are ours,
not yours!
LOMOV
: No, mine, honoured Natalya Stepanovna.
NATALYA
: Well, I never knew that before. How do you make that
out?
LOMOV
: How? I’m speaking of those Oxen Meadows which are
wedged in between your birchwoods and the Burnt
Marsh.
NATALYA
: Yes, yes... they’re ours.
LOMOV
: No, you’re mistaken, honoured Natalya Stepanovna,
they’re mine.
NATALYA
: Just think, Ivan Vassilevitch! How long have they been
yours?
LOMOV
: How long? As long as I can remember.
NATALYA
: Really, you won’t get me to believe that!
LOMOV
: But you can see from the documents, honoured Natalya
Stepanovna. Oxen Meadows, it’s true, were once the
subject of dispute, but now everybody knows that they
are mine. There’s nothing to argue about. You see my
aunt’s grandmother gave the free use of these Meadows
in perpetuity to the peasants of your father’s grandfather,
in return for which they were to make bricks for her. The
peasants belonging to your father’s grandfather had the
free use of the Meadows for forty years, and had got into
the habit of regarding them as their own, when it
happened that...
NATALYA
: No, it isn’t at all like that! Both grandfather and great-
grandfather reckoned that their land extended to Burnt
Marsh — which means that Oxen Meadows were ours. I
don’t see what there is to argue about. It’s simply silly!

LOMOV
: I’ll show you the documents, Natalya Stepanovna!
NATALYA
: No, you’re simply joking, or making fun of me. What a
surprise! We’ve had the land for nearly three hundred
years, and then we’re suddenly told that it isn’t ours!
Ivan Vassilevitch, I can hardly believe my own ears. These
Meadows aren’t worth much to me. They only come to
five dessiatins, and are worth perhaps 300 roubles, but I
can’t stand unfairness. Say what you will, I can’t stand
unfairness.
LOMOV
: Hear me out, I implore you! The peasants of your father’s
grandfather, as I have already had the honour of
explaining to you, used to bake bricks for my aunt’s
grandmother. Now my aunt’s grandmother, wishing to
make them a pleasant...
NATALYA
: I can’t make head or tail of all this about aunts and
grandfathers and grandmothers. The Meadows are ours,
that’s all.
LOMOV
: Mine.
NATALYA
: Ours! You can go on proving it for two days on end, you
can go and put on fifteen dress jackets, but I tell you
they’re ours, ours, ours! I don’t want anything of yours
and I don’t want to give anything of mine. So there!
LOMOV
: Natalya Stepanovna, I don’t want the Meadows, but I am
acting on principle. If you like, I’ll make you a present
of them.
NATALYA
: I can make you a present of them myself, because they’re
mine! Your behaviour, Ivan Vassilevitch, is strange, to
say the least! Up to this we have always thought of you
as a good neighbour, a friend; last year we lent you our
threshing-machine, although on that account we had to
put off our own threshing till November, but you behave
to us as if we were gypsies. Giving me my own land,
indeed! No, really, that’s not at all neighbourly! In my
opinion, it’s even impudent, if you want to know.
LOMOV
: Then you make out that I’m a landgrabber? Madam, never
in my life have I grabbed anybody else’s land and I shan’t
allow anybody to accuse me of having done so. [Quickly
steps to the carafe and drinks more water] Oxen Meadows

LOMOV
: But, please, Stepan Stepanovitch, how can they be yours?
Do be a reasonable man! My aunt’s grandmother gave
the Meadows for the temporary and free use of your
grandfather’s peasants. The peasants used the land for
forty years and got accustomed to it as if it was their
own, when it happened that...
CHUBUKOV : Excuse me, my precious. You forget just this, that the
peasants didn’t pay your grandmother and all that,
because the Meadows were in dispute, and so on. And
now everybody knows that they’re ours. It means that
you haven’t seen the plan.
LOMOV
: I’ll prove to you that they’re mine!
CHUBUKOV : You won’t prove it, my darling —
LOMOV
: I shall
CHUBUKOV : Dear one, why yell like that? You won’t prove anything
just by yelling. I don’t want anything of yours, and don’t
intend to give up what I have. Why should I? And you
know, my beloved, that if you propose to go on arguing
about it, I’d much sooner give up the Meadows to the
peasants than to you. There!
LOMOV
: I don’t understand! How have you the right to give away
somebody else’s property?
CHUBUKOV : You may take it that I know whether I have the right or
not. Because, young man, I’m not used to being spoken
to in that tone of voice, and so on. I, young man, am
twice your age, and ask you to speak to me without
agitating yourself, and all that.
LOMOV
: No, you just think I’m a fool and want to have me on! You
call my land yours, and then you want me to talk to you
calmly and politely! Good neighbours don’t behave like
that, Stepan Stepanovitch! You’re not a neighbour, you’re
a grabber!
CHUBUKOV : What’s that? What did you say?
NATALYA

honourable people, and not one has ever been tried for
embezzlement, like your grandfather!
CHUBUKOV : You Lomovs have had lunacy in your family, all of you!

LOMOV

Natalya Stepanovna, after the harvest. Oh, have you
heard? Just think, what a misfortune I’ve had! My dog
Guess, who you know, has gone lame.
NATALYA
: What a pity! Why?
LOMOV
: I don’t know. Must have got his leg twisted or bitten by
some other dog. [sighs] My very best dog, to say nothing
of the expense. I gave Mironov 125 roubles for him.
NATALYA
: It was too much, Ivan Vassilevitch.
LOMOV
: I think it was very cheap. He’s a first-rate dog.
NATALYA
: Papa gave 85 roubles for his Squeezer, and Squeezer is
heaps better than Guess!
LOMOV
: Squeezer better than Guess? What an idea! [laughs]
Squeezer better than Guess!
NATALYA
: Of course he’s better! Of course, Squeezer is young, he
may develop a bit, but on points and pedigree he’s better
than anything that even Volchanetsky has got.
LOMOV
: Excuse me, Natalya Stepanovna, but you forget that he
is overshot, and an overshot always means the dog is a
bad hunter!
NATALYA
: Overshot, is he? The first time I hear it!
LOMOV
: I assure you that his lower jaw is shorter than the upper.
NATALYA
: Have you measured?
LOMOV
: Yes. He’s all right at following, of course, but if you want
to get hold of anything...
NATALYA
: In the first place, our Squeezer is a thoroughbred animal,
the son of Harness and Chisels while there’s no getting
at the pedigree of your dog at all. He’s old and as ugly as
a worn-out cab-horse.
LOMOV
: He is old, but I wouldn’t take five Squeezers for him.
Why, how can you? Guess is a dog; as for Squeezer, well,
it’s too funny to argue. Anybody you like has a dog as
good as Squeezer... you may find them under every bush
almost. Twenty-five roubles would be a handsome price
to pay for him.
NATALYA
: There’s some demon of contradition in you today, Ivan
Vassilevitch. First you pretend that the Meadows are
yours; now, that Guess is better than Squeezer. I don’t
like people who don’t say what they mean, because
you know perfectly well that Squeezer is a hundred

thing: is your Squeezer overshot or not? Yes or no?
CHUBUKOV : And suppose he is? What does it matter? He’s the best dog
in the district for all that, and so on.
LOMOV
: But isn’t my Guess better? Really, now?
CHUBUKOV : Don’t excite yourself, my precious one. Allow me. Your
Guess certainly has his good points. He’s purebred, firm
on his feet, has well-sprung ribs, and all that. But, my
dear man, if you want to know the truth, that dog has
two defects: he’s old and he’s short in the muzzle.
LOMOV
: Excuse me, my heart... Let’s take the facts. You will
remember that on the Marusinsky hunt my Guess ran
neck-and-neck with the Count’s dog, while your Squeezer
was left a whole verst behind.

everybody else’s dogs. Yes, we’re all like that! You too, sir,

which contains the reporting verb, and the reported clause. Look at the
following sentences.
(a) “I went to visit my grandma last week,” said Mamta.
(b) Mamta said that she had gone to visit her grandma the previous week.
In sentence (a), we have Mamta’s exact words. This is an example of direct
speech. In sentence (b), someone is reporting what Mamta said. This is
called indirect speech or reported speech. A sentence in reported speech
is made up of two parts — a reporting clause and a reported clause.
In sentence (b), Mamta said is the reporting clause containing the reporting
verb said. The other clause — that she had gone to visit her grandma last
week — is the reported clause.
Notice that in sentence (b) we put the reporting clause first. This is done to
show that we are not speaking directly, but reporting someone else’s words.
The tense of the verb also changes; past tense (went) becomes past perfect
(had gone).
Here are some pairs of sentences in direct and reported speech. Read them
carefully, and do the task that follows:
1.
(i) LOMOV
:
Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count
on her consent? (Direct Speech)
(ii) Lomov asked Stepan Stepanovitch respectfully if he thought he might
count on her consent. (Reported Speech)
2.
(i) LOMOV
:
I’m getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Direct
Speech)
(ii) Lomov said that he was getting a noise in his ears from excitement.
(Reported Speech)
3.
(i) NATALYA
:
Why haven’t you been here for such a long time? (Direct
Speech)
(ii) Natalya Stepanovna asked why he hadn’t been there for such a long
time. (Reported Speech)
4.
(i) CHUBUKOV :
What’s the matter? (Direct Speech)
(ii) Chubukov asked him what the matter was. (Reported Speech)
5.
(i) NATALYA
:
My mowers will be there this very day! (Direct Speech)
(ii) Natalya Stepanovna declared that her mowers would be there that
very day. (Reported Speech)
You must have noticed that when we report someone’s exact words, we
have to make some changes in the sentence structure. In the following
sentences fill in the blanks to list the changes that have occurred in
the above pairs of sentences. One has been done for you.

into reported speech. Leave the other sentences unchanged.
“Why do you want to know my age? If people know I am so old, I won’t get
work!” laughs 90-year-old A. K. Hangal, one of Hindi cinema’s most famous
character actors. For his age, he is rather energetic. “What’s the secret?”
we ask. “My intake of everything is in small quantities. And I walk a lot,”
he replies. “I joined the industry when people retire. I was in my 40s. So
I don’t miss being called a star. I am still respected and given work,
when actors of my age are living in poverty and without work. I don’t
have any complaints,” he says, adding, “but yes, I have always been
underpaid.” Recipient of the Padma Bhushan, Hangal never hankered
after money or materialistic gains. “No doubt I am content today, but
money is important. I was a fool not to understand the value of money
earlier,” he regrets.

One afternoon, when I happened to be specially busy, word came to
my office room that Bimala had sent for me. I was startled.
“Who did you say had sent for me?” I asked the messenger.
“The Rani Mother”.
“The Bara Rani?”
“No, sir, the Chota Rani Mother.”
The Chota Rani! It seemed a century since I had been sent for by her.
I kept them all waiting there, and went off into the inner apartments.
When I stepped into our room I had another shock of surprise to find
Bimala there with a distinct suggestion of being dressed up. The room,
which from persistent neglect, had latterly acquired an air of having
grown absent-minded, had regained something of its old order this
afternoon. I stood there silently, looking enquiringly at Bimala.
She flushed a little and the fingers of her right hand toyed for a time
with the bangles on her left arm. Then she abruptly broke the silence.
“Look here! Is it right that ours should be the only market in all Bengal
which allows foreign goods?”
“What, then, would be the right thing to do?” I asked.
“Order them to be cleared out!”
“But the goods are not mine.”
“Is not the market yours?”
“It is much more theirs who use it for trade.”
“Let them trade in Indian goods, then.”
“Nothing would please me better. But suppose they do not?”
“Nonsense! How dare they be so insolent? Are you not…”
“I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out. But I
must refuse to tyrannise.”
“It would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of the
country.”
“To tyrannise for the country is to tyrannise over the country. But
that I am afraid you will never understand.” With this I came away.

natural science did not form part of the curriculum). When he was eighteen, he married
Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his senior. He seems to have prospered in the
London theatre world. He probably began his career as an actor in London, and he
earned enough as author to acquire landed property.
When he was forty-seven, he retired to a large house in Stratford. He died in
1616, leaving behind a body of work that still stands as a pinnacle in world literature.

Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to
fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds
could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and
sweet. The man went out for no other reason than
to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body,
and when he returned he exclaimed, ‘‘These aren’t
raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones
are fives.’’
With a satisfied expression he regarded the field
of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of
rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow
and along with the rain very large hailstones began
to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.
The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out
to collect the frozen pearls.
‘‘It’s really getting bad now,’’ exclaimed the man.
“I hope it passes quickly.” It did not pass quickly.
For an hour the hail rained on the house, the
garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole
valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.
Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was
totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the
plants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness. When
the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the
field and said to his sons, “A plague of locusts would

But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary

hope: help from God.
“Don’t be so upset, even though this seems like
a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.”
“That’s what they say: no one dies of hunger.”
All through the night, Lencho thought only of
his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he
had been instructed, see everything, even what is
deep in one’s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a
man, working like an animal in the fields, but still
he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at
daybreak, he began to write a letter which he
himself would carry to town and place in the mail.
It was nothing less than a letter to God.
“God,” he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family
and I will go hungry this year. I need a hundred
pesos in order to sow my field again and to live
until the crop comes, because the hailstorm....”
He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter
inside and, still troubled, went to town. At the post
office, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped
it into the mailbox.
One of the employees, who was a postman and
also helped at the post office, went to his boss

fellow — also broke out laughing, but almost
immediately he turned serious and, tapping the
letter on his desk, commented, “What faith! I wish I
had the faith of the man who wrote this letter.
Starting up a correspondence with God!”
So, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God,
the postmaster came up with an idea: answer the
letter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to
answer it he needed something more than goodwill,
ink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution: he
asked for money from his employees, he himself gave
part of his salary, and several friends of his were
obliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’.
It was impossible for him to gather together the
hundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer
only a little more than half. He put the money in an
envelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter
containing only a single word as a signature: God.

Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on
seeing the money; such was his confidence — but
he became angry when he counted the money. God
could not have made a mistake, nor could he have
denied Lencho what he had requested.
Immediately, Lencho went up to the window to

There are two kinds of conflict in the story: between humans and nature,

I. Look at the following sentence from the story.
Suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large
hailstones began to fall.
‘Hailstones’ are small balls of ice that fall like rain. A storm in which
hailstones fall is a ‘hailstorm’. You know that a storm is bad weather with
strong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.

depending on their nature. Can you match the names in the box with
their descriptions below, and fill in the blanks? You may use a dictionary
to help you.

Ocean: __ __ r __ __ __ __ __ __

A very strong wind that moves very fast in a spinning movement and

II. Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story:
(a) I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly.
(b) There was a single hope: help from God.
In the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to
happen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something
to happen.

III. Relative Clauses
Look at these sentences
(a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at
the sky.
(b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.’’
The italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho
and the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with
a relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose,
and which.
The relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because
we already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a
particular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don’t
need the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a
larger set.
A non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a
comma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the
relative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop.
Join the sentences given below using who, whom, whose, which, as
suggested.
1.
I often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. (which)
2.
My mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very

4.

5.
This man cheated me. I trusted him. (whom)
Sometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For
example, look at the first sentence of the story:
(a) The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a
low hill.
We can rewrite this sentence as:
(b) The house — which was the only one in the entire valley — sat on
the crest of a low hill.
In (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present.
IV. Using Negatives for Emphasis
We know that sentences with words such as no, not or nothing show the
absence of something, or contradict something. For example:
(a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)
(b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)
(c) These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
(Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from
the sky are)
But sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at
these sentences from the story:
(d) Lencho…had done nothing else but see the sky towards the north-
east. (He had done only this)
(e) The man went out for no other reason than to have the pleasure of
feeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason)
(f) Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on seeing the money.
(He showed no surprise at all)
Now look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to
emphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the farmer.
Find sentences in the story with negative words, which express the
following ideas emphatically.
1.
The trees lost all their leaves.
2.
The letter was addressed to God himself.
3.
The postman saw this address for the first time in his career.

to another thing. Some common metaphors are

a table is described as a leg.
•

WHAT YOU CAN DO
Before You Read: Encourage students to share their ideas about what will happen in the
story.
Activity: Before filling out the form, get the students to read through the form and
decide which parts they should fill out, and which parts will be filled in by the postal
department. Ask a few students to volunteer to actually send a money order (the
amount need not be large) and share the experience with the rest of the class.
Reading: Break the text up into manageable chunks for reading (three paragraphs, for
example), and encourage students to read silently, on their own. Give them enough
time to read, and then discuss what they have read before going on to the next portion.
Use the ‘Oral Comprehension Checks’ in the appropriate places, and use the ‘Thinking
about the Text’ questions at the end of the passage to help them go beyond the text.
Grammar: After they have done the exercise, ask students to make their own sentences
with non-defining relative clauses — for example, ‘Meena, who’s a very clever girl, is
always first in class.’ Or, ‘Our gardener, who knows a lot about plants, loves to talk
about them.’
Speaking: Take the first turn — talk to the students about an instance from your own
life, or from that of someone you know.

more ‘beautiful’ tree such as a maple, or an oak, or a pine?
(iii) What do the ‘crow’ and ‘hemlock’ represent — joy or sorrow? What does
the dust of snow that the crow shakes off a hemlock tree stand for?

Mandela had to spend thirty years in prison. Finally, democratic

the first black President of a new nation.
In this extract from his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom,
Mandela speaks about a historic occasion, ‘the inauguration’. Can

     Mandela Becomes South Africa’s First Black President
Nelson Mandela has become South Africa’s first Black
President after more than three centuries of White rule.
Mr Mandela’s African National Congress (ANC) party won
252 of the 400 seats in the first democratic elections of South
Africa’s history.
The inauguration ceremony took place in the Union
Buildings amphitheatre in Pretoria today, attended by
politicians and dignitaries from more than 140 countries
around the world. “Never, never again will this beautiful land
experience the oppression of one by another, ” said Nelson
Mandela in his address.
… Jubilant scenes on the streets of Pretoria followed the
ceremony with blacks, whites and coloureds celebrating
together... More than 100,000 South African men, women
and children of all races sang and danced with joy.

TENTH May dawned bright and clear. For the past

inauguration would be the largest gathering ever of
international leaders on South African soil.
The ceremonies took place in the lovely
sandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union
Buildings in Pretoria. For decades this had been
the seat of white supremacy, and now it was the
site of a rainbow gathering of different colours and
nations for the installation of South Africa’s first
democratic, non-racial government.

Today, all of us do, by our presence here... confer glory

an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long,
must be born a society of which all humanity will

We, who were outlaws not so long ago, have today

We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation.
We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the

A few moments later we all lifted our eyes in
awe as a spectacular array of South African jets,
helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect
formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only
a display of pinpoint precision and military force,
but a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to
democracy, to a new government that had been
freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the
highest generals of the South African defence force
and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and
medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged
their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that
not so many years before they would not have
saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala
jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue
and gold of the new South African flag.
The day was symbolised for me by the playing of
our two national anthems, and the vision of whites
singing ‘Nkosi Sikelel –iAfrika’ and blacks singing
‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although
that day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem
they once despised, they would soon know the
words by heart.
On the day of the inauguration, I was
overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first
decade of the twentieth century, a few years after
the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,
the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched
up their differences and erected a system of racial
domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their
own land. The structure they created formed the
basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane,
societies the world has ever known. Now, in the
last decade of the twentieth century, and my own
eighth decade as a man, that system had been

That day had come about through the
unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,
people whose suffering and courage can never be
counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so
many other days, that I was simply the sum of all
those African patriots who had gone before me. That
long and noble line ended and now began again
with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank
them and that they were not able to see what their
sacrifices had wrought.
The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting
wound in my country and my people. All of us will
spend many years, if not generations, recovering
from that profound hurt. But the decades of
oppression and brutality had another, unintended,

courage, wisdom and generosity that their like may
never be known again. Perhaps it requires such
depths of oppression to create such heights of
character. My country is rich in the minerals and
gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always
known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer
and truer than the purest diamonds.
It is from these comrades in the struggle that I
learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I
have seen men and women risk and give their lives
for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks
and torture without breaking, showing a strength
and resilience that defies the imagination. I learned
that courage was not the absence of fear, but the
triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does
not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.
No one is born hating another person because of
the colour of his skin, or his background, or his
religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can
learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love
comes more naturally to the human heart than its
opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when
my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would
see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards,
perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to
reassure me and keep me going. Man’s goodness is
a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.

society, each man is able to fulfil those obligations
according to his own inclinations and abilities. But
in a country like South Africa, it was almost
impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil
both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of
colour who attempted to live as a human being was
punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who
tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably
ripped from his family and his home and was forced
to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy
and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to
place my people above my family, but in attempting
to serve my people, I found that I was prevented
from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a
father and a husband.
I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born
free — free in every way that I could know. Free to
run in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim
in the clear stream that ran through my village, free
to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad
backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my
father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was
not troubled by the laws of man or God.
It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood
freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a
young man that my freedom had already been taken
from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a
student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the
transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,
read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as
a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the
basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my
potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and
having a family — the freedom not to be obstructed
in a lawful life.
But then I slowly saw that not only was I not
free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I
saw that it was not just my freedom that was
curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked
like I did. That is when I joined the African National
Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own
freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom

of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of
my people to live their lives with dignity and self-
respect that animated my life, that transformed a
frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a
law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that
turned a family-loving husband into a man without
a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a
monk. I am no more virtuous or self-sacrificing
than the next man, but I found that I could not
even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was
allowed when I knew my people were not free.
Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of
my people were the chains on all of them, the
chains on all of my people were the chains on me.
I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just
as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away
another man’s freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is
locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-
mindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away
someone else’s freedom, just as surely as I am not
free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed
and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.

II. Using the Definite Article with Names
You know that the definite article ‘the’ is not normally used before proper
nouns. Nor do proper nouns usually occur in the plural. (We do not say:
*The Nelson Mandela, or *Nelson Mandelas.) But now look at this sentence
from the text:
… the decades of oppression and brutality … produced the Oliver Tambos,
the Walter Sisulus, … of our time.
Used in this way with the and/or in the plural, a proper noun carries a
special meaning. For example, what do you think the names above mean?
Choose the right answer.
(a) for example Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, …
(b) many other men like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu …/many men of
their type or kind, whose names may not be as well known.
Did you choose option (b)? Then you have the right answer!
Here are some more examples of ‘the’ used with proper names. Try to
say what these sentences mean. (You may consult a dictionary if you
wish. Look at the entry for ‘the’.)

Sliding through long grass
Near the water hole
Where plump deer pass.
He should be snarling around houses
At the jungle’s edge,
Baring his white fangs, his claws,
Terrorising the village!
But he’s locked in a concrete cell,
His strength behind bars,
Stalking the length of his cage,
Ignoring visitors.
He hears the last voice at night,
The patrolling cars,
And stares with his brilliant eyes

His vision, from the constantly passing bars,
has grown so weary that it cannot hold

a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.
As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,
the movement of his powerful soft strides
is like a ritual dance around a centre
in which a mighty will stands paralysed.
Only at times, the curtain of the pupils

rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,
plunges into the heart and is gone.

His First Flight
THE young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two
brothers and his sister had already flown away the
day before. He had been afraid to fly with them.
Somehow when he had taken a little run forward to
the brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his
wings he became afraid. The great expanse of sea
stretched down beneath, and it was such a long
way down — miles down. He felt certain that his
wings would never support him; so he bent his head
and ran away back to the little hole under the ledge
where he slept at night. Even when each of his
brothers and his little sister, whose wings were far
shorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their
wings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage
to take that plunge which appeared to him so
desperate. His father and mother had come around

calling to him shrilly, upbraiding him, threatening
to let him starve on his ledge unless he flew away.
But for the life of him he could not move.
That was twenty-four hours ago. Since then
nobody had come near him. The day before, all day
long, he had watched his parents flying about with
his brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art
of flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and
how to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older

and pretended to be falling asleep. Still they took
no notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his
sister lying on the plateau dozing with their heads
sunk into their necks. His father was preening the
feathers on his white back. Only his mother was
looking at him. She was standing on a little high
hump on the plateau, her white breast thrust
forward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish
that lay at her feet and then scrapped each side of
her beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened
him. How he loved to tear food that way, scrapping
his beak now and again to whet it.
“Ga, ga, ga,” he cried begging her to bring him
some food. “Gaw-col-ah,” she screamed back
derisively. But he kept calling plaintively, and
after a minute or so he uttered a joyful scream.

eagerly, tapping the rock with his feet, trying to
get nearer to her as she flew across. But when
she was just opposite to him, she halted, her
wings motionless, the piece of fish in her beak
almost within reach of his beak. He waited a
moment in surprise, wondering why she did not
come nearer, and then, maddened by hunger, he
dived at the fish. With a loud scream he fell
outwards and downwards into space. Then a
monstrous terror seized him and his heart stood
still. He could hear nothing. But it only lasted a
minute. The next moment he felt his wings spread
outwards. The wind rushed against his breast
feathers, then under his stomach, and against his
wings. He could feel the tips of his wings cutting
through the air. He was not falling headlong now.
He was soaring gradually downwards and outwards.
He was no longer afraid. He just felt a bit dizzy.
Then he flapped his wings once and he soared
upwards. “Ga, ga, ga, Ga, ga, ga, Gaw-col-ah,” his
mother swooped past him, her wings making a
loud noise. He answered her with another scream.
Then his father flew over him screaming. He saw
his two brothers and his sister flying around him
curveting and banking and soaring and diving.
Then he completely forgot that he had not always
been able to fly, and commended himself to dive
and soar and curve, shrieking shrilly.
He was near the sea now, flying straight over
it, facing straight out over the ocean. He saw a
vast green sea beneath him, with little ridges
moving over it and he turned his beak sideways
and cawed amusedly.
His parents and his brothers and sister had
landed on this green flooring ahead of him. They
were beckoning to him, calling shrilly. He dropped
his legs to stand on the green sea. His legs sank
into it. He screamed with fright and attempted to
rise again flapping his wings. But he was tired and

Why was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are
afraid to make their first flight, or are some birds more timid than others?
Do you think a human baby also finds it a challenge to take its first steps?

“The sight of the food maddened him.” What does this suggest? What

Two Stories about Flying
II
The Black Aeroplane
THE moon was coming up in the east, behind me,
and stars were shining in the clear sky above me.
There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. I was happy to be
alone high up above the sleeping countryside. I was
flying my old Dakota aeroplane over France back to
England. I was dreaming of my holiday and looking
forward to being with my family. I looked at my
watch: one thirty in the morning.
‘I should call Paris Control soon,’ I thought. As I
looked down past the nose of the aeroplane, I saw
the lights of a big city in front of me. I switched on
the radio and said, “Paris Control, Dakota DS 088
here. Can you hear me? I’m on my way to England.
Over.”
The voice from the radio answered me immediately:
“DS 088, I can hear you. You ought to turn twelve
degrees west now, DS 088. Over.”
I checked the map and the compass, switched
over to my second and last fuel tank, and turned
the Dakota twelve degrees west towards England.
‘I’ll be in time for breakfast,’ I thought. A good
big English breakfast! Everything was going well —
it was an easy flight.
Paris was about 150 kilometres behind me when
I saw the clouds. Storm clouds. They were huge.
They looked like black mountains standing in front
of me across the sky. I knew I could not fly up and
over them, and I did not have enough fuel to fly
around them to the north or south.
“I ought to go back to Paris,” I thought, but I
wanted to get home. I wanted that breakfast.
‘I’ll take the risk,’ I thought, and flew that old
Dakota straight into the storm.
Inside the clouds, everything was suddenly black.
It was impossible to see anything outside the
aeroplane. The old aeroplane jumped and twisted
in the air. I looked at the compass. I couldn’t believe

my eyes: the compass was turning round and round
and round. It was dead. It would not work! The
other instruments were suddenly dead, too. I tried
the radio.
“Paris Control? Paris Control? Can you hear me?”
There was no answer. The radio was dead too. I
had no radio, no compass, and I could not see where
I was. I was lost in the storm. Then, in the black
clouds quite near me, I saw another aeroplane. It
had no lights on its wings, but I could see it flying
next to me through the storm. I could see the pilot’s
face — turned towards me. I was very glad to see
another person. He lifted one hand and waved.
“Follow me,” he was saying. “Follow me.”
‘He knows that I am lost,’ I thought. ‘He’s trying
to help me.’
He turned his aeroplane slowly to the north, in
front of my Dakota, so that it would be easier for
me to follow him. I was very happy to go behind the
strange aeroplane like an obedient child.
After half an hour the strange black aeroplane
was still there in front of me in the clouds. Now

there was only enough fuel in the old Dakota’s last
tank to fly for five or ten minutes more. I was
starting to feel frightened again. But then he started
to go down and I followed through the storm.
Suddenly I came out of the clouds and saw two
long straight lines of lights in front of me. It was a
runway! An airport! I was safe! I turned to look for
my friend in the black aeroplane, but the sky was
empty. There was nothing there. The black
aeroplane was gone. I could not see it anywhere.
I landed and was not sorry to walk away from the
old Dakota near the control tower. I went and asked
a woman in the control centre where I was and who
the other pilot was. I wanted to say ‘Thank you’.
She looked at me very strangely, and then
laughed.
“Another aeroplane? Up there in this storm? No
other aeroplanes were flying tonight. Yours was the
only one I could see on the radar.”
So who helped me to arrive there safely without
a compass or a radio, and without any more fuel in
my tanks? Who was the pilot on the strange black
aeroplane, flying in the storm, without lights?

WHAT WE HAVE DONE
Provided two stories about flying — one about a bird, another about a human being in
a plane.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
• As they read the story of the seagull, students can be asked to imagine how a baby
learns to walk, and compare and contrast the two situations.
Reprint 2025-26
• After they read the second story students should be asked for their ideas about the
phantom plane: Was it really there or did the pilot imagine it? If the students feel it
was really there, who could have been piloting it?
• Ask students to narrate their own stories about flying. It could be about flying in an
airplane, or flying a kite, or about watching a bird flying — in short, anything to do
with flight. Give students ten minutes to think quietly about the topic — during this
time, they can make notes about what they want to say. Then ask for volunteer
speakers.

This humorous poem suggests some dangerous ways to identify (or
‘tell’) wild animals! Read it aloud, keeping to a strong and regular
rhythm.
If ever you should go by chance
To jungles in the east;
And if there should to you advance
A large and tawny beast,
If he roars at you as you’re dyin’
You’ll know it is the Asian Lion...
Or if some time when roaming round,
A noble wild beast greets you,
With black stripes on a yellow ground,
Just notice if he eats you.
This simple rule may help you learn
The Bengal Tiger to discern.
If strolling forth, a beast you view,
Whose hide with spots is peppered,
As soon as he has lept on you,
You’ll know it is the Leopard.
’Twill do no good to roar with pain,
He’ll only lep and lep again.

If when you’re walking round your yard
You meet a creature there,
Who hugs you very, very hard,
Be sure it is a Bear.
If you have any doubts, I guess
He’ll give you just one more caress.
Though to distinguish beasts of prey
A novice might nonplus,
The Crocodile you always may
Tell from the Hyena thus:
Hyenas come with merry smiles;
But if they weep they’re Crocodiles.
The true Chameleon is small,
A lizard sort of thing;
He hasn’t any ears at all,
And not a single wing.
If there is nothing on the tree,
’Tis the chameleon you see.

1.
Does ‘dyin’ really rhyme with ‘lion’? Can you say it in such a way that it does?
2.
How does the poet suggest that you identify the lion and the tiger? When
can you do so, according to him?
3.
Do you think the words ‘lept‘ and ‘lep’ in the third stanza are spelt correctly?
Why does the poet spell them like this?
4.
Do you know what a ‘bearhug’ is? It’s a friendly and strong hug — such as
bears are thought to give, as they attack you! Again, hyenas are thought to
laugh, and crocodiles to weep (‘crocodile tears’) as they swallow their victims.
Are there similar expressions and popular ideas about wild animals in your

The Ball Poem
A boy loses a ball. He is very upset. A ball doesn’t cost much, nor is
it difficult to buy another ball. Why then is the boy so upset? Read
the poem to see what the poet thinks has been lost, and what the
boy has to learn from the experience of losing something.
What is the boy now, who has lost his ball,
What, what is he to do? I saw it go
Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
Merrily over — there it is in the water!
No use to say ‘O there are other balls’:
An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down
All his young days into the harbour where
His ball went. I would not intrude on him;
A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now
He senses first responsibility
In a world of possessions. People will take
Balls, balls will be lost always, little boy.
And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.
He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,
The epistemology of loss, how to stand up
Knowing what every man must one day know
And most know many days, how to stand up.
JOHN BERRYMAN
O there are other balls: The words suggest that the loss is not important enough
to worry about
shaking grief: sadness which greatly affects the boy
rigid: stiff

(to) intrude on: here, to enter a situation where one is not welcome
a dime: ten cents (U.S.)
desperate: hopeless
epistemology of loss: understanding the nature of loss — what it means to
lose something
epistemology: The Greek word episteme means ‘knowledge’ (it comes from a
word meaning ‘to understand, to know’). Epistemology is the study of the
nature of knowledge itself.
In pairs, attempt the following questions.
1.
Why does the poet say, “I would not intrude on him”? Why doesn’t he offer
him money to buy another ball?
2.
“… staring down/All his young days into the harbour where/His ball went …”
Do you think the boy has had the ball for a long time? Is it linked to the
memories of days when he played with it?
3.
What does “in the world of possessions” mean?
4.
Do you think the boy has lost anything earlier? Pick out the words that
suggest the answer.
5.
What does the poet say the boy is learning from the loss of the ball? Try to
explain this in your own words.
6.
Have you ever lost something you liked very much? Write a paragraph
describing how you felt then, and saying whether — and how — you got over
your loss.

Foreword
Teaching and learning of language in school education should be based 
on the insight that language learning is a natural process which should 
be enhanced in school for academic and overall achievement of the 
learners. It is extremely important that learner-centric methodologies 
of language learning should be promoted for eliciting critical responses, 
and developing sensitivity to social issues. 
The focus of language learning is on developing skills of language and 
communicative competence. Language learning progresses naturally 
with exposure to and use of language in meaningful situations. In this 
context, importance has been attributed in the National Curriculum 
Framework-2005, to methods of teaching which are process based. 
These give opportunities to learners for engaging with texts through 
various activities and exercises and equip them for self-assessment. 
In multilingual India, English has been one of the languages which 
is being learnt in schools. It is therefore recommended that English 
be learnt along with the language of the learners since it leads to 
transference of skills from the child’s own language to the second 
language (English). 
We, at the NCERT, make an endeavour to provide engaging, relevant, 
and authentic resources. This supplements and complements language 
acquisition and provides opportunities for learners to associate 
experiences with everyday life. 
The Council had developed two books, First Flight (textbook) 
and Footprint without Feet (Supplementary Reader) for Class X  
based on the National Curriculum Framework-2005. The workbook, 
Words and Expressions 2 is a sequential continuation of these. It has 
been developed taking into account the feedback on these books and 
needs of learners and teachers. 
The workbook has also taken into account the skills that are 
critical for overall development of the learners, such as the skills of 
collaboration, creativity and imagination, critical thinking and problem 
solving, communication and compassion. 
We hope this workbook will serve as an effective instrument for 
learners and teachers for adding quality to the teaching and learning 
processes. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations 
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources and 
materials. All the publications of the Council are regularly revised on 
the basis of the feedback from students, parents, teachers, and teacher 
educators.

Rationalisation of Content in the 
Textbooks 
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content 
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises 
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential 
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has 
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. 
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes 
have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the 
following:
•	 Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and 
supplementary readers at different stages of school education
•	 Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing 
language proficiency and is accessible at different stages
•	 For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of 
the prevailing condition of the Pandemic 
•	 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much 
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through 
self-learning or peer-learning
•	 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the 
changes given above.

About the Workbook
Words and Expressions 2 is a sequence to the textbook in English for Class 
X, First Flight. Like Words and Expressions 1, it is a self-study material. 
It lays emphasis on providing a variety of rich and comprehensible 
inputs. This gives learners exposure to the target language and enables 
them to further their skills in the English language. The passages and 
activities given here create opportunities for them to handle the English 
language for performing important language functions and help them 
develop critical thinking on contemporary concerns. The book is 
expected to help learners to read for meaning in context and also serve 
as a base for communication in the English language. 
There are 9 units in this workbook. The chapters of the textbook and 
the units are to be taught in a coordinated manner. The units correspond 
to each lesson in the textbook. There are various tasks in each unit. 
‘Let’s begin’ is followed by Comprehension passages, Vocabulary tasks, 
Grammar exercises, Editing, Listening, Speaking, and Writing activities. 
All units end with Project work reiterating the learning through elaborate 
activities. The sections have followed an integrated approach and focus 
on a particular skill of the English language. 
The introductory section, ‘Let’s begin’ asks questions making the 
students think and discuss on the chapter they have read. They are 
asked to collect information, read various written texts and e-texts, 
watch, and listen to online resources from Internet services like 
YouTube. They can also refer to the materials given in the QR code of 
the textbook along with the reading aloud of the texts and recitation 
of the poems. They are required to work in groups of two or four, note 
down points, develop speech, debate, etc., and then to speak before 
the whole class. This follows an integrated process of reading with 
comprehension, reflection, writing, and expressing thoughts. 
The themes of the unseen comprehension passages, span across 
the literary, cultural, and sociological realms — which appeal to and 
inspire the adolescents — are chosen based on the corresponding 
chapters in the textbook. Reading Comprehension has prose passages 
as well as poems. The familiarity of the context has been taken care 
of while selecting the passages. An attempt has been made to expose 
the learners to a variety of texts, comprehend the meaning of words 
in context, understand the theme, and answer factual and thought-
provoking questions. Learners are also given opportunities to interpret 
poems, be acquainted with beautiful expressions, phrases, and 
understand the expressions of the images. Some questions have been 
given to infer meaning and other to inspire learners to think critically 
and bring out their deeper understanding of the text. Multiple choice 
questions are also given in the book for students to assess themselves.
Reprint 2025-26

The workbook is a self-study material for the students. They are 
encouraged to work in pairs or groups so that they support each other 
and learn from each other. However, if required, teachers may guide. 
A variety of tasks, exercises, and ‘Look up and understand’ are placed 
strategically to build vocabulary in the given context. The learners are 
encouraged to use the dictionary as often as required. The intention is 
to help them learn new words and their usages in different contexts. 
Further, ‘Proofreading marks’ have been given for students to learn the 
basics of proofreading and editing. 
The written and spoken compositions are preceded by discussions 
in peer groups. The themes of the composition include contemporary 
issues like gender, environment, diversity, human values, animal rights, 
adolescent issues which are relevant to the age group, and appropriate 
in the contemporary time. This is to enable the learners to see the 
world, develop necessary skills, and face the challenges of the present 
as well as future. 
Enough opportunities are given to the students to develop listening 
comprehension and to use the English language in real-life situations.  
It is reiterated that basic language skills are developed simultaneously, 
not in isolation, but in an integrated manner. So integrated listening 
and speaking activities are given in the book. Grammar activities are 
presented in everyday contexts and are given with keeping usage in 
mind, not the formal explication of grammatical concepts. 
The fine distinction of the workbook is that it is directly addressed 
to the students. The language used is simple, so that there is less 
dependence on the teachers. The activities are simple and stress free, 
enabling the learners to complete these confidently. Self-learning is 
encouraged. The pair or group work will give students an opportunity 
to look at the work of their peers and make each of them feel both 
responsible as well as independent. Every learner has a unique learning 
style. The group work may help them understand their challenges, 
evaluate themselves vis-a-vis their peers, and find the best way to 
overcome them. 
The project activities given at the end of each unit are expected to 
be engaging, across the entire curriculum and interdisciplinary. These 
help generate interest to explore, analyse, think critically, reflect, and 
then present thoughts orally or in writing. 
‘Fun facts’ are given in the margins throughout the workbook, with 
the hope that the learner would have a lasting impression of the correct 
usage of the English language. Teachers must remember that ‘Fun 
facts’ are for joyful learning and non-evaluative.
It is hoped that this book will help students use the English language 
effectively and meaningfully for the purpose of communication 
which will make them proficient and perceptive users of the English 
language. They will find this workbook enjoyable and rewarding as it 
is learner-centered and activity based. Comments and suggestions 
on any aspect of the workbook are welcome. This would enable us to 
improve the next edition.

The Sermon at 
Benaras
Let’s Begin
1. 	In the lesson ‘The Sermon at Benaras’ you were asked to find 
out the meaning of ‘sermon’. The meanings are given below 
but these are in different contexts: 
•	 a talk on a religious or moral subject 
•	 a long or monotonous piece of admonition or caution or a 
warning, a lecture.
(a)	 Discuss with your classmates the context to which the 
present text belongs.
(b)	 What could be the examples for the different context 
according to you?
(c)	 When your parents or elders say something, you say, 
“Oh, not again!” When do you say so and why?
2. 	Read the poem given below in the context of ‘The Sermon at 
Benaras’. It was actually delivered as a part of a sermon in 
1910 by the author, Canon Henry Scott Holland (1847 — 1918), 
a priest at St. Paul’s Cathedral, London. After reading the 
poem, discuss in groups of four and list the similarities and 
differences between ‘The Sermon at Benaras’ and ‘Death Is 
Nothing At All’. For example the theme, the situation, the 
philosophy of the two speakers etc.
Death Is Nothing At All
Death is nothing at all. 
It does not count. 
I have only slipped away into the next room. 
Nothing has happened.

Everything remains exactly as it was. 
I am I, and you are you, 
and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, 
unchanged. 
Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. 
Call me by the old familiar name. 
Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. 
Put no difference into your tone. 
Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. 
Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed 
together.
Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. 
Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. 
Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow 
upon it. 
Life means all that it ever meant. 
It is the same as it ever was. 
There is absolute and unbroken continuity. 
What is this death but a negligible accident? 
Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? 
I am but waiting for you, for an interval, 
somewhere very near, 
just round the corner. 
All is well. 
Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. 
One brief moment and all will be as it was before. 
How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!
Canon Henry Scott Holland

even minor actions, have some motivation. Proper motivation or 
proper development is an important factor. Thus, if intelligence 
is accompanied with human affection and compassion, what I 
call human feeling, then it is very useful.
If society’s moral values and standards of behaviour become 
negative, each of us will suffer. Therefore, the intentions of an 
individual are very much related to the interests of society. There 
is a definite correlation.
The educational system and family life are two very important 
areas. In the educational field, one has to take care not only 
of the brain, but also of one’s spiritual development. I say 
“spiritual development” not in a religious sense but simply in the 
sense of having a good and compassionate heart. If one has a 
compassionate heart, it automatically brings inner strength and 
allows for less fear and less doubt. Subsequently, one becomes 
happier and more open-minded, thus making more friends in 
society.

Read the poem given below and answer the questions that follow.
Father Gilligan was overworked and extremely tired as he 
kept attending to the sick and dying among his parishioners. He 
was offering them spiritual comfort day and night. One night he 
fell asleep on a chair. God sent his angel down to help his most 
beloved servant of the people.
The Ballad of Father Gilligan
The old priest Peter Gilligan 
Was weary night and day,
For half his flock were in their beds, 
Or under green sods lay.
Once while he nodded on a chair,
At the moth - hour of eve,
Another poor man sent for him,
And he began to grieve.

“I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace,
 For people die and die;”
And after cried he, “God forgive!
My body spake, not I!”
And then, half-lying on the chair, 
He knelt, prayed, fell asleep;
And the moth-hour went from the fields,
And stars began to peep.
They slowly into millions grew,
And leaves shook in the wind;
And God covered the world with shade,
And whispered to mankind.
Upon the time of sparrow chirp
When the moths came once more,
The old priest Peter Gilligan
Stood upright on the floor.
“Mavrone, Mavrone! The man has died,
While I slept on the chair,”
He roused his horse out of its sleep
And rode with little care.
He rode now as he never rode,
By rocky lane and fen;
The sick man’s wife opened the door:
“Father! You come again!”
“And is the poor man dead?” he cried.
“He died an hour ago.”
The old priest Peter Gilligan
In grief swayed to and fro.
“When you were gone he turned and died,
As merry as a bird.”
The old priest Peter Gilligan
He knelt him at that word.
“He who hath made the night of stars
For souls who tire and bleed,
Sent one of His great angles down
To help me in my need.

“This swan is so white,” he thought, “and I am so black. This 
swan must be the happiest bird in the world.”
	 The swan replied, “I was feeling that I was the happiest 
bird around. But I think the parrot is the happiest bird as it 
has two colours.” The crow then approached the parrot. The 
parrot said, “I have only two colours, but the peacock has 
multiple colours.”
	 The crow then visited a peacock in the zoo. “Dear peacock,” 
the crow said, “you are so beautiful. Every day, thousands 
of people come to see you. You are the happiest bird on the 
planet.”
	 The peacock said, “I always thought that I was the most 
beautiful and happy bird on the planet. But I am entrapped 
in this zoo. I have realised that the crow is the only bird not 
kept in a cage, and could happily roam everywhere.”

Listening
	   1. Following is a narrative on Sanchi stupa.  Listen to it carefully 
and answer the questions that follow. You can listen to the 
recorded narrative or ask your teacher, sibling or friend to 
read it aloud.
The fascinating and world 
famous Sanchi stupa is 
located on a hilltop in 
Sanchi town, Madhya 
Pradesh, India. It is one 
of the most important 
Buddhist 
monuments 
that portrays Buddhist 
art 
and 
sculpture. 
Starting from the third 
century BC through the 
twelfth century AD, it 
attracts the attention of thousands of visitors round the year 
including national and foreign tourists, archaeologists, and 
historians among others.
	
This stupa is the oldest stone structure in India that was 
built during the Mauryan period. Originally commissioned 
in the third century BCE by Emperor Ashoka, this huge 
hemispherical dome consists of a central chamber. In this 
chamber, the relics of Lord Buddha are placed. The original 
construction work of this stupa was supervised by Ashoka. 
His wife, Devi, was the daughter of a merchant of nearby 
village, Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the 
venue of her and Ashoka’s wedding. Later, four ornamental 
gateways or toranas facing four directions and a balustrade 
surrounding the stupa were added in the first century 
BCE. The Great stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone 
structures in India and counted among the best conserved 
ancient stupas of Central India. It has been enlisted as an 
UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1989.

The sculptures on the ornamental gateways or toranas 
consist of decorative illustrations of events encompassing the 
life of Lord Buddha. These events are explained in the Jataka 
tales. The tree used here symbolises Lord Buddha. The most 
striking features regarding the stupa is that Lord Buddha has 
been depicted symbolically by figures like thrones, wheels, 
and footprints among others.

It is important to know that everyone has some problem or other, 
and they grieve in unique ways. Your grief is different than those 
around you. You have experienced a loss or an intense sorrow, 
especially caused by someone’s death. This can also refer to the 
loss of physical or cognitive abilities or the loss of something that 
was routine in your life such as friendship, head boy or head girl, 
playing for school, etc.
Discuss with your friend and note down—
•	 what could be the possible reasons for someone’s grief or 
sorrow.
•	 how can they overcome this.
Share your feelings and suggestions in the class.
   Writing
	 1.	 Write a paragraph on how you can help others who are in 
grief. You may consider the following points: 
•	 grief is expressed through a variety of behaviours —

•	 reach out to others in their grief, but some people may 
not want to accept help; some will not share their grief — 
understand this
•	 some others will want to talk about their thoughts and 
feelings — be a support to them, stand by them
•	 let the grieving person  know you care for them — be 
patient
•	 focus on what you can do, like holding their hand, etc. — a 
solace or a consolation

1. 	Facial expressions are non-verbal communications. These 
expressions play an important role in a play. They are 
powerful communication tools. The human face is extremely 
expressive. It is able to convey countless emotions without 
saying a word. Expressions tell us the mood of the characters 
in the play. Some facial expressions are given below. The 
facial expressions are for happiness, sadness, anger, 
surprise, fear, and disgust. Look at the facial expressions 
and write which emotion do they express.

2. 	You have read ‘The Proposal’, a one act play. It is a farce. 
The play is set in only one location, the drawing room of 
Chubukov’s house. All three characters in the play are 
quarrelsome people and they quarrel over petty issues. 
Lomov and Natalya start with the issue like a piece of land 
that is situated at the border between the two neighbors’ 
properties. The discussion turns into a quarrel and the 
marriage proposal is forgotten. They shout at each other. 
They are again dragged into an argument over the superiority 
of each other’s dogs. So, they drag their ancestors in their 
foolish quarrel. They again abuse each other and call 
names.
	
Now, make groups of four and discuss the following 
points. While conducting the discussion, try to use the facial 
expressions given above.
• The marriage proposal is a mockery of romance and 
marriage in the upper class.
• The pride in property, even the superiority of dogs, take 
priority over love and marriage.
• The characters lack patience, stop listening to each other, 
and then contradict each other.
• Do you think these quarrels will promise a happy life?
• What qualities would you consider for a well-matched 
couple?
• Do you think all of us should know how to manage our 
anger?

How Can We Control Anger?
Do you get angry when your mother switches off the television? 
Do you get upset when you lose a game? Do you crib when your 
teacher does not pay attention to you? Most of us can have “yes” 
as an answer to one or more of these situations. Anger sometimes 
gets the better of us and leaves us to regret the consequences 
later. The question is ‘How can we control anger?’
Anger is a normal and healthy emotion only if we know how 
to respond to it. Uncontrolled anger can often harm us directly or 
Reprint 2025-26

indirectly whether we realise or not.  Before we learn to address 
the issue, let us revisit the concept of anger. Anger is nothing but 
absence of peace with oneself, people or situations around us. 
We express it either by being assertive or aggressive.
Let us all become the managers of our own anger. When angry, 
take a few moments to calm down (take five deep breaths, count 
up to ten, drink water, change your place) before responding. 
More often than not we do not have control over the situations 
that distress us. Getting physically active reduces stress. Funny 
dances, clapping, thumping your feet, a walk, making funny 
faces at the mirror, etc., go a long way in helping us let go of the 
anger or the frustration inside us. Once we have our feelings 
under control, go through all the aspects of the situation and 
try to see the same situation from different perspectives. If it is a 
problem try to equip yourself with a few solutions before entering 
the same situation. Avoid holding a grudge with people and learn 
when to seek help from others. Realising your own shortcomings 
can become one of the greatest strengths of character over the 
years to come. 
We can never control circumstances, people or situations as 
they are constantly changing. The only thing we can control is 
our response. So we have to increase our capacity to tolerate, 
ability to understand, and learn to nurture love for others.

On Violence
There is a great deal of violence in the world. There is physical 
violence and also inward violence. Physical violence is to kill 
another, to hurt other people consciously, deliberately or without 
thought, to say cruel things, full of antagonism and hate and 
inwardly, inside the skin, to dislike people, to hate people, to 
criticise people. Inwardly, we are always quarrelling, battling, not 
only with others, but with ourselves. We want people to change, 
we want to force them to our way of thinking. 
In the world, as we grow up, we see a great deal of violence, at 
all levels of human existence. The ultimate violence is war — the 
killing for ideas, for so-called religious principles, for nationalities, 
the killing to preserve a little piece of land. To do that, man will 
kill, destroy, maim, and also be killed himself. There is enormous 
violence in the world, the rich wanting to keep people poor, and 
the poor wanting to get rich and in the process hating the rich. 
And you, being caught in society, are also going to contribute  
to this. 
There is violence between husband, wife, and children. There 
is violence, antagonism, hate, cruelty, ugly criticism, anger — all 
this is inherent in man, inherent in each human being. It is 
antagonism

inherent in you. And education is supposed to help you to go 
beyond all that, not merely to pass an examination and get a job. 
You have to be educated so that you become a really beautiful, 
healthy, sane, rational human being, not a brutal man with a 
very clever brain who can argue and defend his brutality. You 
are going to face all this violence as you grow up. You will forget 
all that you have heard here, and will be caught in the stream of 
society. You will become like the rest of the cruel, hard, bitter, 
angry, violent world, and you will not help to bring about a new 
society, a new world. 
But a new world is necessary. A new culture is necessary. 
The old culture is dead, buried, burnt, exploded, and vaporised. 
You have to create a new culture. A new culture cannot be 
based on violence. The new culture depends on you because the 
older generation has built a society based on violence, based on 
aggressiveness and it is this that has caused all the confusion, 
all the misery. The older generations have produced this world 
and you have to change it. You cannot just sit back and say, “I 
will follow the rest of the people and seek success and position.” 
If you do, your children are going to suffer. You may have a 
good time, but your children are going to pay for it. So, you 
have to take all that into account, the outward cruelty of man to 
man in the name of god, in the name of religion, in the name of 
self-importance, in the name of the security of the family. You 
will have to consider the outward cruelty and violence, and the 
inward violence which you do not yet know.

story or someone may read it aloud to you. Then answer the 
questions that follow.
(Vanka Zhukov, a nine-year old boy, was made an assistant 
to Alyakhin, the Shoemaker. He didn’t go to bed on Christmas 
Eve. When everyone in the shop had gone to Church, he began 
to write on a crumpled sheet of paper. “Dear Grandfather 
Konstantin, he wrote”, I’m writing a letter to you. I wish you 
a Merry Christmas and all good things from the Lord God. 
I’ve no father and mother, and you are all I have left.”)
	
Vanka raised his eyes to the dark windowpane. In his 
imagination he saw his grandfather Konstantin standing 
there. His grandfather was a night watchman on the estate of 
a rich man. Konstantin was a small, thin and lively old man 
of sixty-five whose face was always crinkling with laughter. 
In the daytime the old man slept in the servant’s kitchen 
or cracked jokes with the cooks. At night, wrapped in a big 
sheepskin coat he made rounds of the estate, blowing his 
whistle at regular intervals. He was always followed by his 
dogs, Brownie and Eel. Eel was a particularly remarkable 
dog. He was extremely respectful and endearing and looked 
lovingly on friends and strangers alike; yet no one trusted 
him. He would creep behind someone and bite his leg or run 
off with a peasant’s chicken. Many a time Eel was beaten 
mercilessly, yet he always managed to survive.
	
At this very moment, Vanka thought, grandfather was 
probably standing by the gates, looking up at the bright red 
windows of the village church and cracking jokes with the 
servants. 
	
“What about a pinch of snuff?” he would say, holding out 
his snuffbox to the women. 
	
The women would take a pinch and sneeze and the old 
man would feel happy about it. “Fine for frozen noses, eh!” 
he’d say. 
	
The dogs, too, were given snuff. Brownie would sneeze, 
shake her head and walk away looking hurt. Eel, too polite 
to sneeze, only wagged his tail. 
	
Vanka looked through the window. The weather was 
glorious. The air was fresh. The night was very dark, but the 
roofs of the houses and trees were all covered with snow.

Stars twinkled in the sky and it appeared that they had been 
washed and placed there only for the holidays. 
	
Vanka sighed, and went on writing: “Yesterday I was given 
a beating. That was because when I was rocking the baby 
in the cradle, I unfortunately fell asleep. Another day the 
mistress of the house asked me to clean the fish. I didn’t 
know how, so she rubbed the fish all over my face. My friends 
laughed at me. Then there’s nothing to eat. In the morning 
they give me bread, there is porridge for dinner and in the 
evening only bread again. The master and the mistress eat 
all the good things themselves. I sleep in the corridor and 
when the baby cries, I don’t get any sleep at all because I’ve 
to rock the cradle. Dear Grandfather, please take me away 
from here, take me to the village, it’s more than I can bear.” 
Vanka rubbed his eyes with his fists and sobbed. 
	
“I’ll grind your snuff for you, he went on”, I’ll pray to God 
to keep you healthy and if I ever do anything wrong, you 
can beat me as you like. If you think there’s no place for 
me then I can clean boots or even work as a shepherd boy. 
Grandfather, it’s more than I can bear. I thought of running 
away to the village, but I don’t have any boots. If you’ll help 
me now, I’ll feed you when I grow up and when you die I’ll 
pray for your soul just like I do for my mother.
	
“Dear Grandfather, when they put up the Christmas tree 
at the big house, please take down a golden walnut for me 
and hide it in the green box. Ask the young mistress Olga, 
and say it is for Vanka.” 
	
Vanka sighed and gazed in the direction of the window. 
He remembered it was grandfather who always went to the 
forest to cut down a Christmas tree for the rich people, taking 
Vanka with him. They had a wonderful time together, the 
snow falling, the trees crackling and hares springing across 
the trees,
	
When the tree had been chopped down, grandfather would 
drag it to the big house and they would start decorating it. 
The young mistress Olga, Vanka’s favourite, was the busiest 
of all. Vanka’s mother, when alive, had worked as Olga’s 
maid. Then Olga had given him all the sweets and played 
a lot with Vanka. But after his mother’s death, Vanka was 
sent to the kitchen to be with his grandfather and from there 
to Alyakhin, the shoemaker.

“Come to me, dear grandfather,” Vanka wrote on, “Please,

are always beating me. I’m terribly hungry and so miserable 
that I’m always crying. Remember me to all my friends. I 
remain your grandson, Ivan Zhukov. Dear grandfather, 
please come soon.”
	
Vanka folded the sheet of paper and then put it in an 
envelope he had bought the previous day. He thought for a 
while, then wrote the address: To Grandfather in the Village. 
He added the words: Konstantin Makarich. He was happy 
that no one had disturbed him while he was writing his letter. 
He ran out to the street to post it. Vanka had been told by 
the clerks that letter were dropped in boxes from where they 
were carried all over the world on mail coaches drawn by 
horse and driven by drunken drivers, while the bells jingled. 
Vanka ran to the nearest mailbox and put his letter in it. 
	
An hour later, lulled by sweetest hopes, he was fast asleep. 
He dreamed of a stove. His grandfather was sitting beside it, 
reading out his letter to the cooks. Eel, the dog, was walking 
round the stove, wagging his tail.

have shown me by conferring this honour to me. Gifts are of 
many kinds those achieved by one’s own endeavour are good 
and deserved, but no gift should be conferred on one whose 
worthiness has not been tested. By selecting me without assuring 
yourself of my fitness for the gift, you have laid me under a heavy 
debt and, by your injunctions that I should continue to prove 
worthy of it throughout my life, you have imposed on me a very 
difficult obligation. At present, I cannot say anything because I 
am bound by your love and affection; and, therefore, with your 
blessing and God’s grace, I pray that I may prove worthy of it. 
Should I fail, the blame for my failure will be shared by you 
as well.
On this occasion, I wish to place before you a few 
thoughts which occur to my mind as incidental to our 
hard-won freedom. We have now won our freedom. But 
just as I am doubtful, if I deserved the honour that 
you have done me, you have also to think whether you 
have done everything to deserve freedom that you have 
attained after such a bitter and sustained struggle.
There are people who think that having won freedom, 
there is nothing more to do about it. Freedom has come 
to us through sacrifices. Those who made sacrifices 
tasted the fruit of their efforts and self-denials, but it is for 
those who are now enjoying freedom to taste its fruit. After 
the last World War, there is an all-round deterioration in 
human standards. People have become self-centered. They 
have forgotten or ignored the wider interests of the country. 
The essential and noteworthy features of our struggle were: 
sacrifice, truth, and non-violence. The weapons of the 
World War were: violence, brute force, political and 
military moves, and counter moves. As a result of 
the churning of the ocean, the world has emitted 
poison. That poison is spreading all over and 
there is none to swallow it. The countries which 
were free have managed to digest it somewhat, but we, who have 
just attained our freedom, it is hard to do the same. Therefore, 
those who think that having attained freedom they have attained 
everything have really attained nothing! The freedom that we 
have won is yet to be consolidated.  The foundations of freedom 
have to be well and truly laid! This one-year old child has to be 
nursed and nourished, instructed and strengthened. It is for us 
to do it and we must do it.

In India today, there is no time for useless controversies and 
unnecessary debates and disputes. One can indulge in these 
pastimes when one has time and leisure. At present, we have 
to occupy ourselves with the all absorbing task of making the 
foundation of our freedom strong and unassailable. We have to 
reflect on our place in this broken and destructed world and what 
our duty and obligations are! If we fail to make the best use of 
our freedom to make it worthwhile and turn it to our advantage 
and advancements, future generations will heap curses on us. 
They will say that a spiritualist, a great soul gave us this precious 
boon, but we did not know how to retain it and lost it.
I should like to urge upon those who train citizens of tomorrow 
and to those citizens of tomorrow that we have yet to stand on 
our feet. We must concentrate on one thing alone, viz., how to 
make our country strong and united. We can make it strong 
when hearts are pure and when we fully appreciate our duty. 
Now that foreign rulers have gone, are we in a position to sustain 
the whole burden that has devolved on us? When we took over 
from them, the administrative fabric was in tatters. We have 
to mend and place it. This, in itself, is a heavy responsibility. 
It is for our universities to train young men to shoulder these 
responsibilities.
The great university of life is full of experiences, but to make 
full use of those experiences, all of us students, teachers and 
professors — have to be cautious and on guard.
The most essential requisite is character. If your character is 
lacking and you leave the precincts of the alma mater without 
your character fully developed, you will be wasting an opportunity 
of a lifetime.
You have to realise that India has to attain its rightful place 
in the comity of nations. The leadership of Asia would be hers 
if she conducts herself well and if her citizens make their fitting 
contribution to nation’s resurgence. Whatever trials and troubles 
we might have passed through, there is no denying the fact 
that we have a precious inheritance and the teachings we have 
received from the departed leaders are great assets for us.
India abounds in the resources of nature and manpower. They 
are awaiting full use. That task must devolve on young men and 
women. We ourselves were trained in the school of experience. 
We fought for freedom and we have attained that prize for you. It 
is now up to you to prove yourself worthy of the same. This you 
can do only if you work with single-minded devotion to the cause 
of the country. It is only then that you can deserve this freedom 
and be proud of it.

The real danger of India lies in our disunity. That poison of 
communalism was spread in the past. You should draw a curtain 
over it. Only then could we equip ourselves for the freedom that 
has come to us. There are still people in the country whose loyalty 
to India has not settled down. They should and will leave India.
This is the occasion for mutual help and mutual cooperation. 
We must know what our duty is as true citizens. Your teacher has 
to impart that duty. Unless we learn to shoulder our responsibility 
in the true spirit of discipline and citizenship we cannot go ahead. 
We must strengthen our shoulders and our legs so that we can 
stand erect and bear the burden that has devolved on us. Then 
alone would we secure the real objective of freedom.

Let’s now read the story of a bus conductor and his passengers 
with a dog. The story is written by A.G Gardiner.
All about a Dog
It was a bitterly cold night, and even at the far end of the bus the 
east wind that raved along the street cut like a knife. The bus 
stopped and two women and a man got in together and filled the 
vacant places. The young woman was dressed in sealskin, and 
carried one of those little Pekinese dogs that women in sealskin 
like to carry in their laps. The conductor came in and took the 
fares. Then his eyes rested with old malice on the beady eyed 
toy dog. I saw trouble brewing. This was the opportunity for 
which he had been waiting and he intended to make the most 
of it. I had marked him as the type of what Mr. Wells has called 
the Resentful Employee, the man with a great vague grievance 
against everything and a particular grievance against passengers 
who came and sat in his seat while he shivered at the door.
“You must take that dog out,” he said with sour venom. 
“I shall certainly do nothing of the kind. You can take my 
name and address,” said the woman, who had evidently expected 
the challenge and knew the reply.
“You must take the dog out— that’s my orders.”
“I won’t go on the top in such weather. It would kill me,” said 
the woman.
“Certainly not,” said her lady companion, “You’ve got a cough 
as it is.”
“It’s nonsense,” said her male companion.

The conductor pulled the bell and the bus stopped. “This bus 
doesn’t go until that dog is brought out.” And he stepped on to 
the pavement and waited. It was his moment of triumph. He had 
the law on his side and the whole bus full of angry people under 
the harrow. His embittered soul was having a real holiday.
The storm inside rose high “Shameful!” “He’s no better than 
a German.” “Why isn’t he in the army?” “Call the police. Let’s all 
report him.” “Let’s make him give us our fares back.” Everybody 
was on the side of the lady and the dog.
That little animal sat blinking at the dim lights in happy 
unconsciousness of the rumpus of which he was the cause. 
The conductor came to the door, “What’s your number?” said 
one,  taking out a pocket-book with a gesture of terrible things. 
“There’s my number,” said the conductor imperturbably. “Give 
us our fares back.” “You can’t leave us here all night.” “No fares 
back,” said the conductor.
Two or three passengers got out and disappeared into the 
night. The conductor took another turn on the pavement, then 
went and had a talk with the driver. Another bus, the last on 
the road, sailed by indifferent to the shouts of the passengers to 
stop, “They stick by each other the villains,” was the comment.
Someone pulled the bell violently. That brought the driver 
round to the door, “Who’s conductor of this bus?” he said and 
paused for reply. “None coming,” he returned to his seat, and 
resumed beating his arms across his chest. There was no hope 
in that quarter. A policeman strolled up and looked in at the 
door. An avalanche of indignant protests and appeals burst on 
him. “Well, he’s got his rules, you know,” he said. “Give your 
name and address.” “That’s what he’s been offered, and he won’t 
take it.” “Oh,” said the policeman, and he went away and took 
his stand a few yards down the street, where he was joined by 
two more constables.
And still the little dog blinked at the lights, and the conductor 
walked to and fro on the pavement, like a captain on the 
quarterdeck in the hour of victory. A young woman, whose voice 
had risen high above the gale inside, descended on him with an 
air of threatening and slaughter. He was immovable as cold as 
the night, and as hard as the pavement. She passed on in a fury 
of impotence to the three policemen, who stood like a group of 
statuary on the street watching the drama. Then she came back,

imperiously beckoned to her ‘young man’ who had sat a silent 
witness of her rage, and vanished. Others followed. The bus was 
emptying. Even the dashing young fellow who had demanded the 
number and who had declared he would see this thing through 
if he sat there all night, had taken an opportunity to slip away.
Meanwhile the Pekinese party was passing through every 
stage as of resistance to abject surrender. “I’ll go on the top.” 
said the sealskin lady at last. “You mustn’t.” “I will.” “You’ll have 
pneumonia.” 
“Let me take it.” (This from the man) “Certainly not.” She 
would die with her dog. When she had disappeared up the stairs, 
the conductor came back, pulled the bell, and the bus went on. 
He stood sourly triumphant while his conduct was savagely 
discussed in his face by the remnant of the party.
Then the engine struck work, and the conductor went to help 
the driver. It was a long job and presently the lady with the dog 
stole down the stairs and re-entered the bus. When the engine 
was put right, the conductor came back and pulled the bell. 
Then his eyes fell on the dog, and his hand went to the bell-rope 
again. The driver looked around, the conductor pointed to the 
dog, the bus stopped, and the struggle recommenced with all 
the original features — the conductor walking the pavement, the 
driver smacking his arms on the box, the little dog blinking at 
the lights, the sealskin lady declaring that she would not go on 
the top and finally going.
“I’ve got my rules,” said the conductor to me when I was the 
last passenger left behind. He had won his victory, but felt that 
he would like to justify himself to somebody. “Rules,” I said,“ 
are necessary things, but there are rules and rules. Some are 
hard and fast rules, like the rules of the road, which cannot be 
broken without danger to life and limb. But some are only rules 
for guidance, which you can apply or wink at, as common sense 
dictates, like that rule about the dogs. They are not a whip, put 
in your hand to scourge your passengers with, but an authority 
for an emergency. They are meant to be observed in the spirit, 
not in the letter, for the comfort and not the discomfort of the 
passengers. You have kept the rule and broken its spirit. You 
may mix your rules with a little goodwill and good temper.” He 
took it very well and when I got off the bus he said “Good night” 
quite amiably.

The sentence below is taken from the text you have read. 
The phrase in italic is a phrasal verb. A phrasal verb is a 
combination of words (a verb + a preposition, for example 
check in or a verb + an adverb, for example break down). 
When they are used together, they usually take on a different 
meaning to that of the original verb. 
…Walk away from the old Dakota.
walk away is a phrasal verb which means to move away 
from.

The walls were painted by Ramesh.
 
The first sentence is in active form and the second 
sentence is in passive form. When the person doing the action 
(Ramesh) is the subject, we use the verb in the active voice. 
When the subject is what the action is directed at (the walls), 
we use the verb in the passive voice. In the first sentence, we 
talked about Ramesh but in the second sentence we talked 
about what happened to the walls. 
 
In the passive sentence we use by+agent to add important 
information, that is by Ramesh. We can leave out by+agent if 
it does not provide any specific information.

Text I
The following excerpt is from the diary of Lena Mukhina, a 
teenage girl who had undergone the atrocities of Germans when 
they fortified the city of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad is 
an important landmark in the history of Russia. The siege of 
Leningrad lasted from September 1941 to 1944. The city was cut 
off from the rest of Russia. The Germans continuously bombarded 
the city which resulted in death, destruction, and starvation of 
the people. However, the resolute Russians were warned in the 
beginning that the enemy was at the gate and it was a question 
of life and death. They fought bravely and failed the Germans in 
their evil designs.
Read the excerpt and answer the questions that follow.
Foreword from The Diary of Lena Mukhina

the grip of siege for 872 days and nights. But Leningrad’s citizens

air raids and artillery bombardment of residential 
neighbourhoods drove the city’s inhabitants into 
bomb shelters, several times a day, and for hours at 
a time. People’s initial curiosity in the aftermath 
of the first bomb attacks soon gave way to fear 
and then, in conditions of appalling hunger 
and cold, to apathy. Leningraders welcomed 
inclement weather for the reduced visibility 
it brought. They came to dread sunny days 
and moonlit nights, when the Germans 
would be sure to bomb their city. Cloud 
cover, however, offered no protection 
from artillery fire: in just over six 
months from the start of the siege there 
were only thirty-two days when shells 
did not explode on the city’s streets.
Hunger soon set in. Between September 
and November 1941 the bread rations that had been announced 
in July were reduced five times, reaching their lowest point on 20 
November — 125 ‘blockade grams’ for children, dependents and 
white-collar workers and 250g for manual workers, technicians 
and engineers. Rations of meat, butter, sugar and other food 
items were severely reduced. The summer months and the 
beginning of autumn, when it was still possible to buy food 
without ration cards in ordinary shops and canteens were no 
more than a distant memory.

There are many ways of recording the events, news, and

etc. are a few to name. The journal writing is about writing the 
everyday record of an event or writing about an event, activity 
or experience, etc.
The following is an excerpt from the beginning of A Journal of 
the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe.
A Journal of the Plague Year
It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among 
the rest of my neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse that 
the plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very 
violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in 
the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said from 
Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods which were 
brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought 
from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it 
came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.
We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days 
to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them 
by the invention of men, as I have lived to see practiced since. 
But such things as these were gathered from the letters of 
merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them 
were handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not 
spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.
But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, 
and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming 
over; but all was kept very private. Hence, it was that this rumour 
died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were 
very little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true; till 
the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 
when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long 
Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they 
were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as 
it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, 
the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning 
themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, 
two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house

metal artillery. Fortunately for them, one of the soldiers had 
superhuman strength: Corporal Wojtek, a Syrian brown bear. 
When the bear saw that soldiers were struggling, he’d want to 
help... he’d come over, grab a crate and carry it to the truck. 
This can be heavy work, even for a bear. When Wojtek (bear) 
got tired, he would simply stack one crate on top of the other 
which also helped the soldiers because they didn’t have to lift 
the crate off the ground. Of course, Corporal Wojtek (bear) got 
a reward of honey and marmalade. That was his favourite!

The following is an excerpt about the Parsi community in India 
and their food.
Read the passage and answer the questions.
“Aavoji, aavo, aavo! Welcome to Delhi! Let me show you my 
beautiful city.” The booming voice of Nowrosji Kapadia could 
be heard across the length and breadth of the platform. It was 
Nowrosji’s favourite pastime: a walk to the Old Delhi railway 
station to greet the Frontier Mail as it chugged into Delhi from 
Mumbai to Peshawar. With this refrain, an eager Nowrosji would 
cajole Parsi visitors off the train and take them home for a meal 
and often persuade some to stay overnight or for a few days. He

would use this opportunity to tell them about the advantages 
of shifting to Delhi. Though his wife Jer Bai would occasionally 
object to unknown visitors, she was always overruled. This was 
the beginning of the community of Parsis in Delhi....
...Writing about Parsis in the Delhi of old is not easy. There are 
memories of my grandparents and parents — a collective memory 
of generations past and people long gone, yet here in spirit....
During festive gatherings, the women went to town with the 
food; outside catering was unheard of. The poorer members of 
the community never knew who had paid for what. This tradition 
continued in the northern cities of Lucknow, Kanpur, and 
Allahabad well into the ‘70s. Sadly, that kind of life has almost 
gone forever.
Food preparations began two days in advance. Dar ni pori (rich 
pastry stuffed with sweetened lentils) and malido (halwa) were 
carried in big vatus (pots) and served with puris. Anyone who has 
made malido can vouch for the fact that you need strong biceps; 
it is an exhausting exercise. The first time I made it under my 
grandmother’s supervision was also the last. I could hardly move 
my arms for the next two days! Since then, I gained a healthy 
respect for my dainty grandmother.
The menu was extensive. Breakfast would start with either 
sev—brown vermicelli cooked in milk and served with fresh 
cream—or ravo, semolina pudding, Mithu dahi or sweetened 
curd made with full cream milk was an absolute must. This was 
followed by bafellaeeda, hard-boiled eggs, and kheemo kaleji, 
mutton mince with liver. For lunch, there was almost always 
smori dal  chawal and macchi no patio — white boiled rice with 
yellow dal offset by a tart and tangy fish curry.
Teatime was special at our home. My grandmother made it 
a point to dress for tea; I was made to do the same. Once we 
were ready, out came the treats: Parsi biscuits — batasa,  nan-
khatai and flaky khari; patrel, rolled, steamed arbi leaves stuffed 
with besan masala; kumas, rich Parsi cake; and my favourite, 
bhakra, sweet deep fried doughnuts. That tradition has stayed 
with me. I certainly don’t dress up, but I still need a snack with 
at least three cups of tea!...

You have read about Coorg, its rainforests, and coffee and tea 
from Assam in ‘Glimpses of India’ (First Flight, Class X textbook, 
NCERT). The following extract is about the cultivation of coffee 
in Araku valley in Andhra Pradesh. The story of Araku Valley 
traverses an unusual trajectory through Adivasi empowerment, 
hot-air balloons and some of the best coffee in the world. 
Read the passage given below and answer the questions.
Located at about 1,200m above sea level, the valley, tucked away 
in the north-eastern corner of Andhra Pradesh, shares a border 
with Odisha. For guests and participants at the Araku Balloon 
Festival (ABF), held between 18-20 January every year, this is 
sightseeing like nothing else.
The drive to far-flung coffee estates takes us through the five 
northern mandals of Anantha giri, Dumbriguda, Hukumpeta, 
Munchingi Puttu and Araku valley. The name Araku for the 
coffee was chosen simply because it sounded poetic. The view 
from the ground level is as impressive as the one from above —
the landscape changes from densely forested hills to sweeping 
valleys and terrace farms surrounding occasional village clusters.
The journey of Araku Coffee from a livelihood initiative by the 
Naandi Foundation to a globally appreciated product has been 
in the making for over a decade. It is also intrinsically tied to the 
history of how coffee arrived in this valley. It was a British civil 
servant, N.S. Brodie, who introduced coffee to these hill tracts 
in 1898.

Today, Araku coffee is a brand that works with 517 villages and 
10,986 farmers, all of whom are estate owners and entrepreneurs 
with a stake in the business. The reason the coffee is of such high 
quality is that it follows the best practices of bio-dynamic farming 
by creating an interconnected and symbiotic ecosystem. The soil 
is enriched through composting and a variety of shade trees 
are planted, including cash-yielding fruit trees like mango and 
jackfruit. Terroirs are assessed and careful standard operating 
procedures are put in place from “sapling to savouring”, which 
ensures healthier plants and sweeter cherries and eventually a 
far superior coffee aroma and flavour.

notebook while listening.
During our childhood in Goa, the baker used to be our friend, 
companion and guide. He used to come at least twice a day. 
Once, when he set out in the morning on his selling round, 
and then again, when he returned after emptying his huge 
basket. The jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from 
sleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was it so? Was 
it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The loaves were bought 
by some Paskine or Bastine, the maid-servant of the house! 
What we longed for were those bread-bangles which we chose 
carefully. Sometimes it was sweet bread of a special kind.
	
The baker made his musical entry on the scene with 
the ‘jhang, jhang — sound of his specially made bamboo 
staff. One hand supported the basket on his head and the 
other banged the bamboo on the ground. He would greet the 
lady of the house with a “Good morning” and then place his 
basket on the vertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed 
aside with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered 
to the servant. But we would not give up. We would climb a 
bench or the parapet and peep into the basket, somehow. I 
can still recall the typical fragrance of those loaves; loaves for 
the elders and the bangles for the children. Then we did not 
even care to brush our teeth or wash our mouths properly. 
And why should we? Who would take the trouble of plucking 
the mango leaf for the toothbrush? And why was it necessary 
at all? The tiger never brushed his teeth. Hot tea could wash 
and clean up everything so nicely, after all!

Hi! My name is Bhakat. I am a baby Civet cat. I 
am three month old. Shhh! I am taking a nap with 
my brothers. Yes, I live in a family of humans. 
They treat me like their own Baby!
My home is a little thatched hut by a river in 
a small village in Assam. The hut has an earthen 
floor and mud-splattered walls. Its doors are 
always open. I come and go as I please! Mama 
takes care of all three of us! Her name is Anjali. 
She cooks, cleans and plays with me. I secretly 
think she loves me the most. She lets me be real 
naughty!
Mama is about to make brunch! She is making 
roti and vegetables. I don’t like vegetables, but I 
like fruits. I love meat. I am omnivorous. Mama 
always feeds me before anyone else! I love things 
dipped in milk. They are yummy!
The man of the house is Dharini. If not for him, I 
would not be alive today! My civet mother built a 
nest for me in a very tall coconut tree. One night 
I slipped and fell to the ground! When villagers 
found me they took me to Dharini. Dharini loves 
animals. I began to live in his home. I was very small. I could not 
walk. I ate and slept a lot!
Do you know why my eyes are so large? That’s because I am 
a nocturnal animal. I sleep in the day and am active in the night. 
My large eyes help me see better in the dark! I also have a very 
long tail! It helps me balance on tree-tops and branches. I mostly 
live on trees, though I do come down to the ground. Animals like 
me are called arboreal!
Inside Dharini’s house, I always snooze in the rafters. I like 
being high up; it reminds me of trees! One day I woke up to find 
a strange sight, Dharini’s house was filling with water! In the 
night, the river behind the house started overflowing its banks! 
Inside everything was helter-skelter. Things were piled on top of 
one another! The monsoon had arrived!
Dharini and Anjali carried us babies outside the house! There 
was water everywhere and it was very muddy! But the sun was 
out and it was not raining! I stayed high on the fence and made 
sure even my long tail did not get wet! Dharini went to pick snails.

of water to keep them alive and fresh to eat!
Montu, my brother, tried to be naughty! He caught me and 
threatened to dip me in water! He got a scolding from Dharini.

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that 
follow.
It’s not easy having Elephants in your backyard.
Around the world, as communities expand, and natural wild 
places are reduced, people and wildlife are increasingly coming 
into conflict over living space and food.
It might be baboons in Namibia attacking young goats or 
elephants in Nepal eating crops or European bears and wolves 
killing livestock. The problem is universal, affects rich and poor, 
and is bad news for all concerned.
The impacts are often huge. People lose their crops and 
livestock (and therefore a source of income and food security), 
property, and sometimes their lives — even a severe injury caused 
by wildlife can result in a loss of livelihood. The animals, some of 
which are already threatened or even endangered, are sometimes 
killed in retaliation or to prevent future conflicts.
Human-wildlife conflict is happening more and more, affecting a 
lot of different species. The effects of climate change will probably 
make the problem worse.

How we are tackling human-wildlife conflict
The solutions are often specific to the wildlife or area concerned, 
and are often creative and simple — for instance planting a barrier 
of crops that repel the animals (elephants and some other wildlife 
don’t like chilli, for example).
An important aspect of the work is that it benefits both the 
animals and local people and actively involves the communities 
concerned (in the case of chilli, it can be sold to increase income). 
It’s about finding solutions that lead to mutually beneficial 
coexistence.
The work has also often led to people being more enthusiastic 
and supportive of conservation, and has demonstrated that 
people can live alongside wildlife while developing sustainable 
livelihoods.

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that 
follow.
Animal rights
People who support animal rights recognise that all animals 
have an inherent worth, a value completely separate from their 
usefulness to humans. Every being with a will to live has the 
right to live free from exploitation and suffering. 
All animals have the ability to suffer in the same way and to 
the same degree that humans do. They feel pain, pleasure, fear, 
frustration, loneliness, and familial love. Whenever we consider 
doing something that would interfere with their needs, we are 
morally obligated to take them into account.
People often ask if animal rights mean that animals should 
have the right to vote or drive a car. Of course, that would be 
silly because those aren’t rights that would benefit animals. But 
animals have the right not to suffer at the hands of humans and 
to live their lives free from suffering and exploitation because 
they have an interest in doing so. That is the difference between 
equal consideration and equal treatment.
Almost everyone cares about animals in some context, whether 
it’s a beloved family companion, an irresistibly cute kitten or a 
majestic wild animal seen in a documentary. After all, we each 
have some built-in capacity for empathy and compassion, as can

be seen from the lengths that children often go to in order to help 
animals.
Logically and morally, there is no reason to differentiate in 
the way we treat the animals we share our homes with and those 
who are farmed for food. They are all individuals, with the same 
capacity to feel pain and fear. Animal rights help us to look past 
the arbitrary distinctions between different species, to rediscover 
our innate compassion, and to respect all animals equally.
Anyone who cares about animals can start putting these 
principles into practice every single day with the food they eat, 
the clothes they wear, and the products they buy. These choices 
are a form of non-violent protest that makes a real difference 
both by reducing the profits of corporations that harm or kill 
animals and by creating a growing market for cruelty-free food, 
fashion, services, and entertainment.

after they saw that the crocodile had died. The villagers were 
emotionally attached to the reptile and were heartbroken 
after his death. About 500 people of the small village attended 
the last rites of their beloved crocodile, Gangaram. The over 
three-metre long crocodile was buried in Chhattisgarh’s 
Bawamohatra village after his last rites were performed by 
the villagers. A forest department official estimated that the 
crocodile was 130 years old. The crocodile was carried to its 
funeral on a tractor decorated with flowers and garlands.

the village could swim around him. He had never harmed or

Some say that he would even eat rice and dal which was served 
by the villagers and kids. He was very understanding and if he 
saw anyone swimming near him, he used to go to the other 
side of the pond. Villagers used to identify themselves with the 
crocodile as people used to call this village — Magarmachha 
vala gaaon, the Crocodile’s village. In fact, the villagers now 
wish to build a statue of Gangaram near the pond to remember

Read the passage given below 
and answer the questions that 
follow.
Vishav Driman (65 year old) and her 
husband Kamal Jeet (69 year old) set out to discover 
the hidden treasure of Uttarakhand by bicycle. Vishav 
shares their post-retirement adventure.
Pedalling through the Golden Years
At a time when our peers were slowing down, relaxing 
and watching sunsets from their front porch, we found a 
new passion — cycling. We started out with short 
daily rides, but found ourselves looking forward 
to them more and more, so much that we decided 
to venture further and cover more ground. There 
were obvious health concerns — the risk of 
performing a physically strenuous activity at a 
high altitude, the most obvious of them. But 
it helped that we had lived in Uttarakhand’s 
capital, Dehradun, our entire lives, and were 
therefore acclimatised to the cold winds and 
narrow winding roads that characterise this 
beautiful state. We were also familiar with almost all 
the scenic mountain trails it had to offer. 
Short rides extended to longer ones as we started falling deeper 
in love with not just the sport, but the very idea of discovering 
a world we had always been a part of, but never had the time to 
explore. Soon, a simple hobby turned into a project of sorts, and 
we started participating in cyclotrons and other cycling events 
being held in the city. Admiration and encouragement poured 
in from family members, friends and neighbours along the way, 
sparking a new thought — was it possible to travel across the 
state on our bicycles? It seemed daunting at first, but we knew 
we had to try. Our gear in place, our bikes serviced, and our 
minds set, we set off on an adventure we would remember for 
the rest of our lives.

In my opinion, there are very few ways to 
enjoy and appreciate the beauty of Uttarakhand 
and cycling is the most thrilling of them all. 
Sunlight filtering through the trees and a cool 
breeze gently caressing your faces as you ride, 
coupled with breathtaking views of sal forests 
spread like a green cover on the mountains 
and surrounding valleys, the experience of 
pedalling across the state is truly inexplicable.
Of the many trails we navigated, there is one 
that occupies a special place in our hearts. It 
began from Ghanta Ghar, a popular tourist 
attraction in Dehradun, it took us through 
some of the most picturesque locations of the state such as 
Kimadi, Hathi Paon, Mussoorie and Chaar Dukaan, right up to 
George Everest point. This 100km ride (approximately) is also 
one of the few routes in Uttarakhand that encapsulates all the 
element that one expects while cycling here — steep slopes, sharp 
curves, endless hills, lush forests, and off-road experiences.

Makes the lungs laugh, the throat cry:—
“O bird, see; see, bird, I fly.
“Is this, is this your joy?
O bird, then I, though a boy,
For a golden moment share
Your feathery life in air!”
Say, heart, is there aught like this
In a world that is full of bliss?
‘Tis more than skating, bound
Steel-shod to the level ground.
Speed slackens now, I float
Awhile in my airy boat;
Till, when the wheels scarce crawl,
My feet to the treadles fall.
Alas, that the longest hill
Must end in a vale; but still,
Who climbs with toil, wheresoe’er,

The eastern region of India is no doubt charmingly novel in 
many of its features. Mizoram, literally the land of Mizos is an 
expanse of blue-green hills. Mizoram is broken up lenghwise 
into five major mountain ranges gradually descending from 
the south to the north. The hills are rugged and their heights 
uneven. The name of the state Mizoram is made of two words. 
‘Mi’ means human beings, ‘Zo’ means a hill. So, a ‘Mizo’ is a 
human dweller of a hill; Mizoram means the land of the hill-
dwellers. Aizawl is the capital town of the State built in tiers 
along the hill.
	
The Mizos have three main festivals — Mim Kut, Chapchar 
Kut and Pawl Kut. These festivals are associated with their 
agricultural activities during which they enjoy life by singing 
and dancing. The  Mizos, blessed as they are with a beautiful 
environment and rich culture, are a vibrant and social people. 
They love to dance as much as they love to sing. They boast 
a number of folk and community dances handed down from 
one generation to the other through the ages. The dances are 
expressions of the gay, carefree spirit of the Mizos. It should 
be noted here that these dances are not intended for stage 
performance, rather they have been evolved for community 
involvement and participation.

Reading Comprehension 
Text I
Given below is a story of the tailor who has been known for his 
skills in cheating and stealing. Read in groups of four or in pairs. 
You may discuss the events and incidences of the story with 
your friends and write them in a sequential manner. 
The Trader and the Tailor
There was a tailor who was known for beating others in the art of 
being light-fingered and thievery. A trader swore that even with 
a hundred attempts, the tailor would not be able to take a coil of 
thread from him without his knowledge.
The trader was told that many others, more intelligent than 
him, had been beaten by the tailor. They said he should not 
imagine himself so great, for his ego would only give him worse 
troubles in competition with the tailor. Still, the trader became 
more competitive and made a wager that the tailor would not be 
able to rob him of anything.
He wagered an Arab horse with those who taunted him. If 
the tailor failed to steal, then they would have to give him a 
horse instead. That night, the trader lay awake troubled by the 
situation and could not sleep a wink.
In the morning, he put a piece of satin cloth under his arm 
and went to the bazaar and entered the shop and saluted the 
cunning rogue warmly. The tailor sprang up from his seat and 
welcomed the trader, inquiring about his health with cordiality 
exceeding even that of the trader, planting in his heart great 
feelings of affection for him. When the trader heard these songs 
of sweetness from the tailor, he flung down the piece of silk 
saying, “Cut this into a coat for me and make it wide below my 
navel so as not to hamper my legs and tight about it to show off 
my figure.”
The tailor answered, “O! kindly man, I will do you a hundred 
services,” and accepted the order. He measured the satin and 
inspected  the working surface and all the time chatted away 
to the trader in idle gossip, about other amirs and of bounties 
and gifts he had received from them, and about misers and their 
mean ways, and made the trader laugh with hysterics. During 
this beguiling talk, he was snipping away with his scissors 
rapidly, cutting as fast as his lips moved.

The trader was laughing, the tailor was cutting, the trader 
closed his eyes in joy, the tailor cut extra pieces, tucking them 
under his thighs, hidden away from all but God. From his delight 
at the tailor’s tales, the trader’s former boast went out of his 
mind. What satin? What boast? What wager? The trader was 
drunk on the jokes told by the tailor.
Then the tailor told such an incredible story that the trader 
fell over on his back with laughter. The tailor swiftly stitched a 
swatch of the satin to the hem of his underpants while the trader 
was paying no attention at all, greedily sucking with every guffaw 
at the jests the tailor told. The tailor continued to tell funnier and 
funnier tales and jokes until the trader was completely within 
his power.
With his eyes shut and his reason vanished, the bewildered 
and boastful trader was drunk with joy. And the tailor continued 
to cut, filching yet more of the beautiful cloth, with nothing to 
stop him now. And yet the trader begged for more. 
You who becomes the slave of the jest, no story is more 
laughable than you yourself, think on this at the edge of 
your grave. How long will you listen to the lies of this world 
that leave your mind and spirit unhinged? The Universal 
Tailor will cut and stitch the hems of a hundred travellers, 
silly as children.
Eventually the tailor became bored with the whole story and 
told the trader that he better leave before another tale was told, 
“For if I tell another one, the coat will be too tight for you, and 
you will stop laughing and weep tears of blood.”

	 Speaking
	 1.	 Lencho, the main character in the story, is a farmer. 
He supports his family through farming. The conflict in 
the story happens when a hailstorm strikes the field and 
destroys his farm. All the hard work, for nothing! The entire 
land is wrecked by catastrophe. There is no one who can 
help. Lencho’s complete faith in God is amazing during the 
calamity.
	
	 	
So, one type of conflict dominating in the story is man 
versus nature. Discuss with your partner the natural calamities 
that play havoc in the lives of people. Collect photographs and 
make a visual presentation to share in the class.
	 2.	 Try writing a small poem on the topic man versus nature.

Man vs Nature

Is Mother Nature telling us
the best way that she can
to stop the interference

We marvel at her beauty
each time we look around
then dig up all her treasures

We forget that Nature gives us
all that keeps us living
we take it all and still want more
but never think of giving.
We build across the countryside
progressing every day
but Mother Nature can’t progress
for man is in the way.

Request for their pictures. Based on the collected information,

How to do project work in the English 
language classroom?
In addition to the textbook activities, project work could be 
used as an effective strategy to promote collaborative ways of 
language learning where we work together in groups to do an 
activity. We collect information, ideas; observe the language 
being used; use language in real life situations; exchange 
views and debate on ideas; write the ideas into a report; edit 
our writing and produce the report in a suitable form. This 
helps in constructing ideas and analysing critical judgments 
of the peers to arrive at a decision or conclusion.
It would be of much benefit to learners, if projects planned 
are of an interdisciplinary nature.
Designing and managing projects
There are many ways students can be initiated to carry out 
projects. 
•	 Read books, newspapers, listen to the radio, watch 
TV, consult websites and encyclopedia, talk to people, 
observe events and proceedings, interview people, 
record audio/ video, collect pictures and illustrations, 
interpret them, and report.
•	 Write field notes to remember and organise the data 
collected.
Reprint 2025-26
Words and Expressions 2 – Class X
16
•	 Bring your own ideas to the class and have a class 
discussion.
•	 Use language meaningfully and precisely. If the meaning 
of learning is ‘meaning making’, the purpose is achieved 
fully while doing projects.
•	 Learners should do the projects in group independently. 
They should not ask their parents to do these or buy 
readymade products available in the market.
•	 They may seek information or some help from parents 
or elders.
Planning, writing the draft and editing
Having collected the required data, information and ideas, 
plan and organise the data and interpret them to write the 
draft. It could be posters, a script of a play (enact and direct 
a play), songs, essays, etc. Editing is an important part 
of writing the report. Students should be made aware of 
process approach involved in writing a good piece of work. 
Then present it to the whole class or to the school during the 
assembly or on special occasions (in case of play, songs, etc.).

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework 2005, recommends that children’s life at school
must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from
the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a
gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also
attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between
different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in
the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy
on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue
imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and
freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed
on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.
The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than
a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem
of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages
with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.
The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and
activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this
book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and
Mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisors for this book, Professor
P. Sinclair of IGNOU, New Delhi and Professor G.P. Dikshit (Retd.) of Lucknow
University, Lucknow for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers

contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals
for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which
have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.
We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,
appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human
Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and

Rationalisation of Content in the Textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content
load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In
this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks
across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across
classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•
Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class
•
Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject
•
Difficulty level
•
Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from
teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning
•
Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes
given above.

Preface
Through the years, from the time of the Kothari Commission, there have been
several committees looking at ways of making the school curriculum meaningful
and enjoyable for the learners. Based on the understanding developed over the
years, a National Curriculum Framework (NCF) was finalised in 2005. As part of
this exercise, a National Focus Group on Teaching of Mathematics was formed. Its
report, which came in 2005, highlighted a constructivist approach to the teaching
and learning of mathematics.
The essence of this approach is that children already know, and do some
mathematics very naturally in their surroundings, before they even join school. The
syllabus, teaching approach, textbooks etc., should build on this knowledge in a way
that allows children to enjoy mathematics, and to realise that mathematics is more
about a way of reasoning than about mechanically applying formulae and algorithms.
The students and teachers need to perceive mathematics as something natural and
linked to the world around us. While teaching mathematics, the focus should be on
helping children to develop the ability to particularise and generalise, to solve and
pose meaningful problems, to look for patterns and relationships, and to apply the
logical thinking behind mathematical proof. And, all this in an environment that the
children relate to, without overloading them.
This is the philosophy with which the mathematics syllabus from Class I to
Class XII was developed, and which the textbook development committee has tried
to realise in the present textbook. More specifically, while creating the textbook, the
following broad guidelines have been kept in mind.
l
The matter needs to be linked to what the child has studied before, and to
her experiences.
l
The language used in the book, including that for ‘word problems’, must be
clear, simple and unambiguous.
l
Concepts/processes should be introduced through situations from the
children’s environment.
l
For each concept/process give several examples and exercises, but not of
the same kind. This ensures that the children use the concept/process again
and again, but in varying contexts. Here ‘several’ should be within reason,
not overloading the child.
l
Encourage the children to see, and come out with, diverse solutions to
problems.
Reprint 2025-26
l
As far as possible, give the children motivation for results used.
l
All proofs need to be given in a non-didactic manner, allowing the learner to
see the flow of reason. The focus should be on proofs where a short and
clear argument reinforces mathematical thinking and reasoning.
l
Whenever possible, more than one proof is to be given.
l
Proofs and solutions need to be used as vehicles for helping the learner
develop a clear and logical way of expressing her arguments.
l
All geometric constructions should be accompanied by an analysis of the
construction and a proof for the steps taken to do the required construction.
Accordingly, the children would be trained to do the same while doing
constructions.
l
Add such small anecdotes, pictures, cartoons and historical remarks at
several places which the children would find interesting.
l
Include optional exercises for the more interested learners. These would
not be tested in the examinations.
l
Give answers to all exercises, and solutions/hints for those that the children
may require.
l
Whenever possible, propagate constitutional values.
As you will see while studying this textbook, these points have been kept in mind
by the Textbook Development Committee. The book has particularly been created
with the view to giving children space to explore mathematics and develop the abilities
to reason mathematically. Further, two special appendices have been given — Proofs
in Mathematics, and Mathematical Modelling. These are placed in the book for
interested students to study, and are only optional reading at present. These topics
may be considered for inclusion in the main syllabi in due course of time.
As in the past, this textbook is also a team effort. However, what is unusual
about the team this time is that teachers from different kinds of schools have been
an integral part at each stage of the development. We are also assuming that teachers
will contribute continuously to the process in the classroom by formulating examples
and exercises contextually suited to the children in their particular classrooms. Finally,
we hope that teachers and learners would send comments for improving the textbook
to the NCERT.

A1.1 Introduction
The ability to reason and think clearly is extremely useful in our daily life. For example,
suppose a politician tells you, ‘If you are interested in a clean government, then you
should vote for me.’ What he actually wants you to believe is that if you do not vote for
him, then you may not get a clean government. Similarly, if an advertisement tells you,
‘The intelligent wear XYZ shoes’, what the company wants you to conclude is that if
you do not wear XYZ shoes, then you are not intelligent enough. You can yourself
observe that both the above statements may mislead the general public. So, if we
understand the process of reasoning correctly, we do not fall into such traps
unknowingly.
The correct use of reasoning is at the core of mathematics, especially in constructing
proofs. In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of proofs, and you actually proved
many statements, especially in geometry. Recall that a proof is made up of several
mathematical statements, each of which is logically deduced from a previous statement
in the proof, or from a theorem proved earlier, or an axiom, or the hypotheses. The
main tool, we use in constructing a proof, is the process of deductive reasoning.
We start the study of this chapter with a review of what a mathematical statement
is. Then, we proceed to sharpen our skills in deductive reasoning using several examples.
We shall also deal with the concept of negation and finding the negation of a given
statement. Then, we discuss what it means to find the converse of a given statement.
Finally, we review the ingredients of a proof learnt in Class IX by analysing the proofs
of several theorems. Here, we also discuss the idea of proof by contradiction, which
you have come across in Class IX and many other chapters of this book.
A1.2 Mathematical Statements Revisited
Recall, that a ‘statement’ is a meaningful sentence which is not an order, or an
exclamation or a question. For example, ‘Which two teams are playing in the
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
Reprint 2025-26
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
219
Cricket World Cup Final?’ is a question, not a statement. ‘Go and finish your homework’
is an order, not a statement. ‘What a fantastic goal!’ is an exclamation, not a statement.
Remember, in general, statements can be one of the following:
always true
always false
ambiguous
In Class IX, you have also studied that in mathematics, a statement is
acceptable only if it is either always true or always false. So, ambiguous sentences
are not considered as mathematical statements.
Let us review our understanding with a few examples.
Example 1 : State whether the following statements are always true, always false or
ambiguous. Justify your answers.
(i) The Sun orbits the Earth.
(ii) Vehicles have four wheels.
(iii) The speed of light is approximately 3 × 105 km/s.
(iv) A road to Kolkata will be closed from November to March.
(v) All humans are mortal.
Solution :
(i) This statement is always false, since astronomers have established that the Earth
orbits the Sun.
(ii) This statement is ambiguous, because we cannot decide if it is always true or
always false. This depends on what the vehicle is — vehicles can have 2, 3, 4, 6,
10, etc., wheels.
(iii) This statement is always true, as verified by physicists.
(iv) This statement is ambiguous, because it is not clear which road is being referred
to.
(v) This statement is always true, since every human being has to die some time.
Example 2 : State whether the following statements are true or false, and justify your
answers.
(i) All equilateral triangles are isosceles.
(ii) Some isosceles triangles are equilateral.
(iii) All isosceles triangles are equilateral.
(iv) Some rational numbers are integers.
Reprint 2025-26
220
MATHEMATICS
(v) Some rational numbers are not integers.
(vi) Not all integers are rational.
(vii) Between any two rational numbers there is no rational number.
Solution :
(i) This statement is true, because equilateral triangles have equal sides, and therefore
are isosceles.
(ii) This statement is true, because those isosceles triangles whose base angles are
60° are equilateral.
(iii) This statement is false. Give a counter-example for it.
(iv) This statement is true, since rational numbers of the form 
,
p
q  where p is an
integer and q = 1, are integers (for example, 
3
3
1

).
(v) This statement is true, because rational numbers of the form 
,
p
q  p, q are integers
and q does not divide p, are not integers (for example, 3

In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of deductive reasoning. Here, we will
work with many more examples which will illustrate how deductive reasoning is

used to deduce conclusions from given statements that we assume to be true. The
given statements are called ‘premises’ or ‘hypotheses’. We begin with some examples.
Example 5 : Given that Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka, and suppose Shabana
lives in Bijapur. In which state does Shabana live?
Solution : Here we have two premises:
(i) Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka
(ii) Shabana lives in Bijapur
From these premises, we deduce that Shabana lives in the state of Karnataka.
Example 6 : Given that all mathematics textbooks are interesting, and suppose you
are reading a mathematics textbook. What can we conclude about the textbook you
are reading?
Solution : Using the two premises (or hypotheses), we can deduce that you are
reading an interesting textbook.
Example 7 : Given that y = – 6x + 5, and suppose x = 3. What is y?
Solution : Given the two hypotheses, we get y = – 6 (3) + 5 = – 13.
Example 8 : Given that ABCD is a parallelogram,
and suppose AD = 5 cm, AB = 7 cm (see Fig. A1.1).
What can you conclude about the lengths of DC and
BC?
Solution : We are given that ABCD is a parallelogram.
So, we deduce that all the properties that hold for a
parallelogram hold for ABCD. Therefore, in particular,
the property that ‘the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal to each other’, holds.
Since  we know AD = 5 cm, we can deduce that BC = 5 cm. Similarly, we deduce that
DC = 7 cm.
Remark : In this example, we have seen how we will often need to find out and use
properties hidden in a given premise.
Example 9 : Given that 
p  is irrational for all primes p, and suppose that 19423 is a
prime. What can you conclude about 19423 ?
Solution : We can conclude that 19423  is irrational.
In the examples above, you might have noticed that we do not know whether the
hypotheses are true or not. We are assuming that they are true, and then applying
deductive reasoning. For instance, in Example 9, we haven’t checked whether 19423

is a prime or not; we assume it to be a prime for the sake of our argument.What we
are trying to emphasise in this section is that given a particular statement, how we use
deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. What really matters here is that we use
the correct process of reasoning, and this process of reasoning does not depend on the
trueness or falsity of the hypotheses. However, it must also be noted that if we start
with an incorrect premise (or hypothesis), we may arrive at a wrong conclusion.

about A?

A1.4 Conjectures, Theorems, Proofs and Mathematical Reasoning
Consider the Fig. A1.2. The first circle
has one point on it, the second two points,
the third three, and so on. All possible
lines connecting the points are drawn in
each case.
The lines divide the circle into
mutually exclusive regions (having no
common portion). We can count these
and tabulate our results as shown :

Some of you might have come up with a formula predicting the number of regions
given the number of points. From Class IX, you may remember that this intelligent
guess is called a ‘conjecture’.
Suppose your conjecture is that given ‘n’ points on a circle, there are 2n – 1
mutually exclusive regions, created by joining the points with all possible lines. This
seems an extremely sensible guess, and one can check that if n = 5, we do get 16
regions. So, having verified this formula for 5 points, are you satisfied that for any n
points there are 2n – 1 regions? If so, how would you respond, if someone asked you,
how you can be sure about this for n = 25, say? To deal with such questions, you
would need a proof which shows beyond doubt that this result is true, or a counter-
example to show that this result fails for some ‘n’. Actually, if you are patient and try
it out for n = 6, you will find that there are 31 regions, and for n = 7 there are 57
regions. So, n = 6, is a counter-example to the conjecture above. This demonstrates
the power of a counter-example. You may recall that in the Class IX we discussed
that to disprove a statement, it is enough to come up with a single counter-
example.
You may have noticed that we insisted on a proof regarding the number
of regions in spite of verifying the result for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Let us consider
a few more examples. You are familiar with the following result (given in Chapter 5):
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = 
(
1)
2
n n 
. To establish its validity, it is not enough to verify the
result for n = 1, 2, 3, and so on, because there may be some ‘n’ for which this result is
not true (just as in the example above, the result failed for n = 6). What we need is a
proof which establishes its truth beyond doubt. You shall learn a proof for the same in
higher classes.

Now, consider Fig. A1.3, where PQ and PR
are tangents to the circle drawn  from P.
You have proved that PQ = PR (Theorem 10.2).
You were not satisfied by only drawing several such
figures, measuring the lengths of the respective
tangents, and verifying for yourselves that the result
was true in each case.
Do you remember what did the proof consist of ? It consisted of a sequence of
statements (called valid arguments), each following from the earlier statements in
the proof, or from previously proved (and known) results independent from the result
to be proved, or from axioms, or from definitions, or from the assumptions you had
made. And you concluded your proof with the statement PQ = PR, i.e., the statement
you wanted to prove. This is the way any proof is constructed.
We shall now look at some examples and theorems and analyse their proofs to
help us in getting a better understanding of how they are constructed.
We begin by using the so-called ‘direct’ or ‘deductive’ method of proof. In this
method, we make several statements. Each is based on previous statements. If
each statement is logically correct (i.e., a valid argument), it leads to a logically correct
conclusion.

A1.5 Negation of a Statement
In this section, we discuss what it means to ‘negate’ a statement. Before we start, we
would like to introduce some notation, which will make it easy for us to understand
these concepts. To start with, let us look at a statement as a single unit, and give it a
name. For example, we can denote the statement ‘It rained in Delhi on 1 September
2005’ by p. We can also write this by
p: It rained in Delhi on 1 September 2005.
Similarly, let us write
q: All teachers are female.
r: Mike’s dog has a black tail.
s: 2 + 2 = 4.
t: Triangle ABC is equilateral.
This notation now helps us to discuss properties of statements, and also to see
how we can combine them. In the beginning we will be working with what we call
‘simple’ statements, and will then move onto ‘compound’ statements.
Reprint 2025-26
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
229
Now consider the following table in which we make a new statement from each
of the given statements.
         Original statement
                New statement
p: It rained in Delhi on
~p: It is false that it rained in Delhi
1 September 2005
on 1 September 2005.
q: All teachers are female.
~ q: It is false that all teachers are
female.
r: Mike’s dog has a black tail.
~r: It is false that Mike’s dog has a
black  tail.
s: 2 + 2 = 4.
~s: It is false that 2 + 2 = 4.
t: Triangle ABC is equilateral.
~t: It is false that triangle ABC is
equilateral.
Each new statement in the table is a negation of the corresponding old statement.
That is, ~p, ~q, ~r, ~s and ~t are negations of the statements p, q, r, s and t, respectively.
Here, ~p is read as ‘not p’. The statement ~p negates the assertion that the statement
p makes. Notice that in our usual talk we would simply mean ~p as ‘It did not rain in
Delhi on 1 September 2005.’ However, we need to be careful while doing so. You
might think that one can obtain the negation of a statement by simply inserting the
word ‘not’ in the given statement at a suitable place. While this works in the case of
p, the difficulty comes when we have a statement that begins with ‘all’. Consider, for
example, the statement q: All teachers are female. We said the negation of this statement
is ~q: It is false that all teachers are female. This is the same as the statement ‘There
are some teachers who are males.’ Now let us see what happens if we simply insert
‘not’ in q. We obtain the statement: ‘All teachers are not female’, or we can obtain the
statement: ‘Not all teachers are female.’ The first statement can confuse people. It
could imply (if we lay emphasis on the word ‘All’) that all teachers are male! This is
certainly not the negation of q. However, the second statement gives the meaning of
~q, i.e., that there is at least one teacher who is not a female. So, be careful when
writing the negation of a statement!
So, how do we decide that we have the correct negation? We use the following
criterion.
Let p be a statement and ~p its negation. Then ~p is false whenever p is
true, and ~p is true whenever p is false.
Reprint 2025-26
230
MATHEMATICS
For example, if it is true that Mike’s dog has a black tail, then it is false that
Mike’s dog does not have a black tail. If it is false that ‘Mike’s dog has a black tail’,
then it is true that ‘Mike’s dog does not have a black tail’.
Similarly, the negations for the statements s and t are:
s: 2 + 2 = 4; negation, ~s: 2 + 2  4.
t: Triangle ABC is equilateral; negation, ~t: Triangle ABC is not equilateral.
Now, what is ~(~s)? It would be 2 + 2 = 4, which is s. And what is ~(~t)? This
would be ‘the triangle ABC is equilateral’, i.e., t. In fact, for any statement p, ~(~p)
is p.
Example 12 : State the negations for the following statements:
(i) Mike’s dog does not have a black tail.
(ii) All irrational numbers are real numbers.
(iii)
2  is irrational.
(iv) Some rational numbers are integers.
(v) Not all teachers are males.
(vi) Some horses are not brown.
(vii) There is no real number x, such that x2 = – 1.
Solution :
(i) It is false that Mike’s dog does not have a black tail, i.e., Mike’s dog has a black
tail.
(ii) It is false that all irrational numbers are real numbers, i.e., some (at least one)
irrational numbers are not real numbers. One can also write this as, ‘Not all
irrational numbers are real numbers.’
(iii) It is false that 
2 is irrational, i.e., 
2  is not irrational.
(iv) It is false that some rational numbers are integers, i.e., no rational number is an
integer.
(v) It is false that not all teachers are males, i.e., all teachers are males.
(vi) It is false that some horses are not brown, i.e., all horses are brown.
(vii) It is false that there is no real number x, such that x2 = – 1, i.e., there is at least
one real number x, such that x2 = – 1.
Remark : From the above discussion, you may arrive at the following Working Rule
for obtaining the negation of a statement :
(i) First write the statement with a ‘not’.
(ii) If there is any confusion, make suitable modification , specially in the statements
involving ‘All’ or ‘Some’.

A1.6 Converse of a Statement
We now investigate the notion of the converse of a statement. For this, we need the
notion of a ‘compound’ statement, that is, a statement which is a combination of one or
more ‘simple’ statements. There are many ways of creating compound statements,
but we will focus on those that are created by connecting two simple statements with
the use of the words ‘if’ and ‘then’. For example, the statement ‘If it is raining, then it
is difficult to go on a bicycle’, is made up of two statements:
p: It is raining
q: It is difficult to go on a bicycle.
Using our previous notation we can say: If p, then q. We can also say ‘p implies
q’, and denote it by p  q.
Now, supose you have the statement ‘If the water tank is black, then it contains
potable water.’ This is of the form p  q, where the hypothesis is p (the water tank
is black) and the conclusion is q (the tank contains potable water). Suppose we
interchange  the hypothesis and the conclusion, what do we get? We get q  p, i.e., if
the water in the tank is potable, then the tank must be black. This statement is called
the converse of the statement p  q.
Reprint 2025-26
232
MATHEMATICS
In general, the converse of the statement p  q is q  p, where p and q are
statements. Note that p  q and q  p are the converses of each other.
Example 13 : Write the converses of the following statements :
(i) If Jamila is riding a bicycle, then 17 August falls on a Sunday.
(ii) If 17 August is a Sunday, then Jamila is riding a bicycle.
(iii) If Pauline is angry, then her face turns red.
(iv) If a person has a degree in education, then she is allowed to teach.
(v) If a person has a viral infection, then he runs a high temperature.
(vi) If Ahmad is in Mumbai, then he is in India.
(vii) If triangle ABC is equilateral, then all its interior angles are equal.
(viii) If x is an irrational number, then the decimal expansion of x is non-terminating
non-recurring.
(ix) If x – a is a factor of the polynomial p(x), then p(a) = 0.
Solution : Each statement above is of the form p  q. So, to find the converse, we
first identify p and q, and then write q  p.
(i) p: Jamila is riding a bicycle, and q: 17 August falls on a Sunday. Therefore, the
converse is: If 17 August falls on a Sunday, then Jamila is riding a bicycle.
(ii) This is the converse of (i). Therefore, its converse is the statement given in
(i) above.
(iii) If Pauline’s face turns red, then she is angry.
(iv) If a person is allowed to teach, then she has a degree in education.
(v) If a person runs a high temperature, then he has a viral infection.
(vi) If Ahmad is in India, then he is in Mumbai.
(vii) If all the interior angles of triangle ABC are equal, then it is equilateral.
(viii) If the decimal expansion of x is non-terminating non-recurring, then x is an
irrational number.
(ix) If p(a) = 0, then x – a is a factor of the polynomial p(x).
Notice that we have simply written the converse of each of the statements
above without worrying if they are true or false. For example, consider the following
statement: If Ahmad is in Mumbai, then he is in India. This statement is true. Now
consider the converse: If Ahmad is in India, then he is in Mumbai. This need not be
true always – he could be in any other part of India.

PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS

In mathematics, especially in geometry, you will come across many situations
where p  q is true, and you will have to decide if the converse, i.e., q  p, is also
true.
Example 14 : State the converses of the following statements. In each case, also
decide whether the converse is true or false.
(i) If n is an even integer, then 2n + 1 is an odd integer.
(ii) If the decimal expansion of a real number is terminating, then the number is
rational.
(iii) If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of corresponding
angles is equal.
(iv) If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then the quadrilateral is
a parallelogram.
(v) If two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding angles are equal.
Solution :
(i) The converse is ‘If 2n + 1 is an odd integer, then n is an even integer.’ This is a
false statement  (for example, 15 = 2(7) + 1, and 7 is odd).
(ii) ‘If a real number is rational, then its decimal expansion is terminating’, is the
converse. This is a false statement, because a rational number can also have a
non-terminating recurring decimal expansion.
(iii) The converse is ‘If a transversal intersects two lines in such a way that each
pair of corresponding angles are equal, then the two lines are parallel.’ We have
assumed, by Axiom 6.4 of your Class IX textbook, that this statement is true.
(iv) ‘If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal’,
is the converse. This is true (Theorem 8.1, Class IX).
(v) ‘If the corresponding angles in two triangles are equal, then they are congruent’,
is the converse. This statement is false. We leave it to you to find suitable counter-
examples.

A1.7 Proof by Contradiction
So far, in all our examples, we used direct arguments to establish the truth of the
results. We now explore ‘indirect’ arguments, in particular, a very powerful tool in
mathematics known as ‘proof by contradiction’. We have already used this method in
Chapter 1 to establish the irrationality of several numbers and also in other chapters to
prove some theorems. Here, we do several more examples to illustrate the idea.
Before we proceed, let us explain what a contradiction is. In mathematics, a
contradiction occurs when we get a statement p such that p is true and ~p, its negation,
is also true. For example,
p: 
a
x
b

, where a and b are coprime.
q: 2 divides both ‘a’ and ‘b’.
If we assume that p is true and also manage to show that q is true, then we have
arrived at a contradiction, because q implies that the negation of p is true. If you
remember, this is exactly what happened when we tried to prove that 
2  is irrational
(see Chapter 1).
How does proof by contradiction work? Let us see this through a specific example.
Suppose we are given the following :
All women are mortal. A is a woman. Prove that A is mortal.
Even though this is a rather easy example, let us see how we can prove this by
contradiction.
Let us assume that we want to establish the truth of a statement p (here we
want to show that p : ‘A is mortal’ is true).
Reprint 2025-26
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
235
So, we begin by assuming that the statement is not true, that is, we assume that
the negation of p is true (i.e., A is not mortal).
We then proceed to carry out a series of logical deductions based on the truth of
the negation of p. (Since A is not mortal, we have a counter-example to the
statement ‘All women are mortal.’ Hence, it is false that all women are mortal.)
If this leads to a contradiction, then the contradiction arises because of our faulty
assumption that p is not true. (We have a contradiction, since we have shown
that the statement ‘All women are mortal’ and its negation, ‘Not all women are
mortal’ is true at the same time. This contradiction arose, because we assumed
that A is not mortal.)
Therefore, our assumption is wrong, i.e., p has to be true. (So, A is mortal.)
Let us now look at examples from mathematics.

A2.1 Introduction

An adult human body contains approximately 1,50,000 km of arteries and veins
that carry blood.

The human heart pumps 5 to 6 litres of blood in the body every 60 seconds.

The temperature at the surface of the Sun is about 6,000° C.
Have you ever wondered how our scientists and mathematicians could possibly
have estimated these results? Did they pull out the veins and arteries from some adult
dead bodies and measure them? Did they drain out the blood to arrive at these results?
Did they travel to the Sun with a thermometer to get the temperature of the Sun?
Surely not. Then how did they get these figures?
Well, the answer lies in mathematical modelling, which we introduced to you
in Class IX. Recall that a mathematical model is a mathematical description of some
real-life situation. Also, recall that mathematical modelling is the process of creating a
mathematical model of a problem, and using it to analyse and solve the problem.
So, in mathematical modelling, we take a real-world problem and convert it to an
equivalent mathematical problem. We then solve the mathematical problem, and interpret
its solution in the situation of the real-world problem. And then, it is important to see
that the solution, we have obtained, ‘makes sense’, which is the stage of validating the
model. Some examples, where mathematical modelling is of great importance, are:
(i) Finding the width and depth of a river at an unreachable place.
(ii) Estimating the mass of the Earth and other planets.
(iii) Estimating the distance between Earth and any other planet.
(iv) Predicting the arrrival of the monsoon in a country.

(viii) Estimating the number of leaves in a tree.
(ix) Estimating the ppm of different pollutants in the atmosphere of a city.
(x) Estimating the effect of pollutants on the environment.
(xi) Estimating the temperature on the Sun’s surface.
In this chapter we shall revisit the process of mathematical modelling, and take
examples from the world around us to illustrate this. In Section A2.2 we take you
through all the stages of building a model. In Section A2.3, we discuss a variety of
examples. In Section A2.4, we look at reasons for the importance of mathematical
modelling.
A point to remember is that here we aim to make you aware of an important way
in which mathematics helps to solve real-world problems. However, you need to know
some more mathematics to really appreciate the power of mathematical modelling. In
higher classes some examples giving this flavour will be found.
A2.2 Stages in Mathematical Modelling
In Class IX, we considered some examples of the use of modelling. Did they give you
an insight into the process and the steps involved in it? Let us quickly revisit the main
steps in mathematical modelling.
Step 1 (Understanding the problem) : Define the real problem, and if working in a
team, discuss the issues that you wish to understand. Simplify by making assumptions
and ignoring certain factors so that the problem is manageable.
For example, suppose our problem is to estimate the number of fishes in a lake. It is
not possible to capture each of these fishes and count them. We could possibly capture
a sample and from it try and estimate the total number of fishes in the lake.
Step 2 (Mathematical description and formulation) : Describe, in mathematical
terms, the different aspects of the problem. Some ways to describe the features
mathematically, include:
define variables
write equations or inequalities
gather data and organise into tables
make graphs
calculate probabilities
Reprint 2025-26
MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
241
For example, having taken a sample, as stated in Step 1, how do we estimate the
entire population? We would have to then mark the sampled fishes, allow them to mix
with the remaining ones in the lake, again draw a sample from the lake, and see how
many of the previously marked ones are present in the new sample. Then, using ratio
and proportion, we can come up with an estimate of the total population. For instance,
let us take a sample of 20 fishes from the lake and mark them, and then release them
in the same lake, so as to mix with the remaining fishes. We then take another sample
(say 50), from the mixed population and see how many are marked. So, we gather our
data and analyse it.
One major assumption we are making is that the marked fishes mix uniformly
with the remaining fishes, and the sample we take is a good representative of the
entire population.
Step 3 (Solving the mathematical problem) : The simplified mathematical problem
developed in Step 2 is then solved using various mathematical techniques.
For instance, suppose in the second sample in the example in Step 2, 5 fishes are
marked. So, 5
1
,
,
i.e.,
50
10  of the population is marked. If this is typical of the whole
population, then 1
10 th of the population = 20.
So, the whole population = 20 × 10 = 200.
Step 4 (Interpreting the solution) : The solution obtained in the previous step
is now looked at, in the context of the real-life situation that we had started with in
Step 1.
For instance, our solution in the problem in Step 3 gives us the population of
fishes as 200.
Step 5 (Validating the model) : We go back to the original situation and see if the
results of the mathematical work make sense. If so, we use the model until new
information becomes available or assumptions change.
Sometimes, because of the simplification assumptions we make, we may lose
essential  aspects of the real problem while giving its mathematical description. In
such cases, the solution could very often be off the mark, and not make sense in the
real situation. If this happens, we reconsider the assumptions made in Step 1 and
revise them to be more realistic, possibly by including some factors which were not
considered earlier.

For instance, in Step 3 we had obtained an estimate of the entire population of
fishes. It may  not be the actual number of fishes in the pond. We next see whether
this is a good estimate of the population by repeating Steps 2 and 3 a few times, and
taking the mean of the results obtained. This would give a closer estimate of the
population.
Another way of visualising the process of mathematical modelling is shown
in Fig. A2.1.
Fig. A2.1
Modellers look for a balance between simplification (for ease of solution) and
accuracy. They hope to approximate reality closely enough to make some progress.
The best outcome is to be able to predict what will happen, or estimate an outcome,
with reasonable accuracy. Remember that different assumptions we use for simplifying
the problem can lead to different models. So, there are no perfect models. There are
good ones and yet better ones.

A2.3 Some Illustrations
Let us now consider some examples of mathematical modelling.
Example 1 (Rolling of a pair of dice) : Suppose your teacher challenges you to the
following guessing game: She would throw a pair of dice. Before that you need to
guess the sum of the numbers that show up on the dice. For every correct answer, you
get two points and for every wrong guess you lose two points. What numbers would
be the best guess?
Solution :
Step 1 (Understanding the problem) : You need to know a few numbers which
have higher chances of showing up.
Step 2 (Mathematical description) : In mathematical terms, the problem translates
to finding out the probabilities of the various possible sums of numbers that the dice
could show.
We can model the situation very simply by representing a roll of the dice as a random
choice of one of the following thirty six pairs of numbers.

The first number in each pair represents the number showing on the first die, and the
second number is the number showing on the second die.
Step 3 (Solving the mathematical problem) : Summing the numbers in each pair
above, we find that possible sums are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. We have to find
the probability for each of them, assuming all 36 pairs are equally likely.
We do this in the following table.

Observe that the chance of getting a sum of a seven is 1/6, which is larger than the
chances of getting other numbers as sums.
Reprint 2025-26

245
Step 4 (Interpreting the solution) : Since the probability of getting the sum 7 is the
highest, you should repeatedly guess the number seven.
Step 5 (Validating the model) : Toss a pair of dice a large number of times and
prepare a relative frequency table. Compare the relative frequencies with the
corresponding probabilities. If these are not close, then possibly the dice are biased.
Then, we could obtain data to evaluate the number towards which the bias is.
Before going to the next example, you may need some background.
Not having the money you want when you need it, is a common experience for
many people. Whether it is having enough money for buying essentials for daily living,
or for buying comforts, we always require money. To enable the customers with limited
funds to purchase goods like scooters, refrigerators, televisions, cars, etc., a scheme
known as an instalment scheme (or plan) is introduced by traders.
Sometimes a trader introduces an instalment scheme as a marketing strategy to
allure customers to purchase these articles. Under the instalment scheme, the customer
is not required to make full payment of the article at the time of buying it. She/he is
allowed to pay a part of it at the time of purchase, and the rest can be paid in instalments,
which could be monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or even yearly. Of course, the buyer
will have to pay more in the instalment plan, because the seller is going to charge some
interest on account of the payment made at a later date (called deferred payment).
Before we take a few examples to understand the instalment scheme, let us
understand the most frequently used terms related to this concept.
The cash price of an article is the amount which a customer has to pay as full
payment of the article at the time it is purchased. Cash down payment is the amount
which a customer has to pay as part payment of the price of an article at the time of
purchase.
Remark : If the instalment scheme is such that the remaining payment is completely
made within one year of the purchase of the article, then simple interest is charged on
the deferred payment.
In the past, charging interest on borrowed money was often considered evil, and,
in particular, was long prohibited. One way people got around the law against
paying interest was to borrow in one currency and repay in another, the interest
being disguised in the exchange rate.
Let us now come to a related mathematical modelling problem.

MATHEMATICS
Example 2 : Juhi wants to buy a bicycle. She goes to the market and finds that the
bicycle she likes is available for ` 1800. Juhi has ` 600 with her. So, she tells the
shopkeeper that she would not be able to buy it. The shopkeeper, after a bit of
calculation, makes the following offer. He tells Juhi that she could take the bicycle by
making a payment of ` 600 cash down and the remaining money could be made in two
monthly instalments of ` 610 each. Juhi has two options one is to go for instalment
scheme or to make cash payment by taking loan from a bank which is available at the
rate of 10% per annum simple interest. Which option is more economical to her?
Solution :
Step 1 (Understanding the problem) : What Juhi needs to determine is whether
she should take the offer made by the shopkeeper or not. For this, she should know the
two rates of interest—one charged in the instalment scheme and the other charged
by the bank (i.e., 10%).
Step 2 (Mathematical description) : In order to accept or reject the scheme, she
needs to determine the interest that the shopkeeper is charging in comparison to the
bank. Observe that since the entire money shall be paid in less than a year, simple
interest shall be charged.
We know that the cash price of the bicycle = ` 1800.
Also, the cashdown payment under the instalment scheme = ` 600.
So, the balance price that needs to be paid in the instalment scheme = ` (1800 – 600)
= ` 1200.
Let r % per annum be the rate of interest charged by the shopkeeper.
Amount of each instalment = ` 610
Amount paid in instalments = ` 610 + ` 610 = ` 1220
Interest paid in instalment scheme = ` 1220 – ` 1200 = ` 20
(1)
Since, Juhi kept a sum of ` 1200 for one month, therefore,
Principal for the first month = ` 1200
Principal for the second month = ` (1200 – 610) = ` 590
Balance of the second principal ` 590 + interest charged (` 20) = monthly instalment
(` 610) = 2nd instalment
So, the total principal for one month = ` 1200 + ` 590 = ` 1790
Now,
interest = ` 1790

 = 13.14 (approx.)
Step 4 (Interpreting the solution) : The rate of interest charged in the instalment
scheme = 13.14 %.
The rate of interest charged by the bank = 10%
So, she should prefer to borrow the money from the bank to buy the bicycle which is
more economical.
Step 5 (Validating the model) : This stage in this case is not of much importance
here as the numbers are fixed. However, if the formalities for taking loan from the
bank such as cost of stamp paper, etc., which make the effective interest rate more
than what it is the instalment scheme, then she may change her opinion.
Remark : Interest rate modelling is still at its early stages and validation is still a
problem of financial markets. In case, different interest rates are incorporated in fixing
instalments, validation becomes an important problem.

A2.4 Why is Mathematical Modelling Important?
As we have seen in the examples, mathematical modelling is an interdisciplinary subject.
Mathematicians and specialists in other fields share their knowledge and expertise to
improve existing products, develop better ones, or predict the behaviour of certain
products.
There are, of course, many specific reasons for the importance of modelling, but
most are related in some ways to the following :
To gain understanding. If we have a mathematical model which reflects the
essential behaviour of a real-world system of interest, we can understand that
system better through an analysis of the model. Furthermore, in the process of
building the model we find out which factors are most important in the system,
and how the different aspects of the system are related.
To predict, or forecast, or simulate. Very often, we wish to know what a real-
world system will do in the future, but it is expensive, impractical or impossible to
experiment directly with the system. For example, in weather prediction, to study
drug efficacy in humans, finding an optimum design of a nuclear reactor, and so
on.
Forecasting is very important in many types of organisations, since
predictions of future events have to be incorporated into the decision-making
process. For example:
In marketing departments, reliable forecasts of demand help in planning of
the sale strategies.
A school board needs to able to forecast the increase in the number of
school going children in various districts so as to decide where and when to
start new schools.
Most often, forecasters use the past data to predict the future. They first analyse
the data in order to identify a pattern that can describe it. Then this data and
pattern is extended into the future in order to prepare a forecast. This basic
strategy is employed in most forecasting techniques, and is based on the assumption
that the pattern that has been identified will continue in the future also.

To estimate. Often, we need to estimate large values. You’ve seen examples of
the trees in a forest, fish in a lake, etc. For another example, before elections, the
contesting parties want to predict the probability of their party winning the elections.
In particular, they want to estimate how many people in their constituency would
vote for their party. Based on their predictions, they may want to decide on the
campaign strategy. Exit polls have been used widely to predict the number of
seats, a party is expected to get in elections.

You would have used one in your science laboratory.
This tube is also a combination of a cylinder and a
hemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may have
seen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments
made up of a combination of solids mentioned above.
If for some reason you wanted to find the
surface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such
objects, how would you do it? We cannot classify
these under any of the solids you have already studied.
In this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such
objects.
12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids
Let us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area of
such a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if
we can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that
this solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would
look like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.
Fig. 12.4
If we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see
only the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder.
So, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface
areas of each of the individual parts. This gives,
TSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder
                             + CSA of other hemisphere
where TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’
respectively.
Let us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting
together a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going
through.

First, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together.
Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the
hemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown
in Fig. 12.5.
Fig. 12.5
At the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if
we want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy,
what would we need to know? We would need to know the surface area of the toy,
which consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone.
So, we can say:
Total surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone
Now, let us consider some examples.
Example 1 : Rasheed got a playing top (lattu) as his
birthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on
it. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is
shaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere
(see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and
the diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he
has to colour. (Take  = 22
7 )
Solution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we
can conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is :
TSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone
Now, the curved surface area of the hemisphere =

You may note that ‘total surface area of the top’ is not the sum of the total
surface areas of the cone and hemisphere.
Example 2 :  The decorative block shown
in Fig. 12.7 is made of two solids — a cube
and a hemisphere. The base of the block is a
cube with edge 5 cm, and the hemisphere
fixed on the top has a diameter of 4.2 cm.
Find the total surface area of the block.
(Take  = 22

Solution : The total surface area of the cube = 6 × (edge)2 = 6 × 5 × 5 cm2 = 150 cm2.
Note that the part of the cube where the hemisphere is attached is not included in the
surface area.
So,

Example 3 : A wooden toy rocket is in the
shape of a cone mounted on a cylinder, as
shown in Fig. 12.8. The height of the entire
rocket is 26 cm, while the height of the conical
part is 6 cm. The base of the conical portion
has a diameter of 5 cm, while the base
diameter of the cylindrical portion is 3 cm. If
the conical portion is to be painted orange
and the cylindrical portion yellow, find the
area of the rocket painted with each of these
colours. (Take  = 3.14)
Solution : Denote radius of cone by r, slant
height of cone by l, height of cone by h, radius
of cylinder by r and height of cylinder by h.
Then r = 2.5 cm, h = 6 cm, r = 1.5 cm,

Here, the conical portion has its circular base resting on the base of the cylinder, but
the base of the cone is larger than the base of the cylinder. So, a part of the base of the
cone (a ring) is to be painted.
So,
the area to be painted orange = CSA of the cone + base area of the cone
                                                           – base area of the cylinder

12.3 Volume of a Combination of Solids
In the previous section, we have discussed how to find the surface area of solids made
up of a combination of two basic solids. Here, we shall see how to calculate their
volumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added the
surface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappeared
in the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculate
the volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually be
the sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below.
Example 5 : Shanta runs an industry in
a shed which is in the shape of a cuboid
surmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig.
12.12). If the base of the shed is of
dimension 7 m × 15 m, and the height of
the cuboidal portion is 8 m, find the volume
of air that the shed can hold. Further,
suppose the machinery in the shed
occupies a total space of 300 m3, and
there are 20 workers, each of whom
occupy about 0.08 m3 space on an
average. Then, how much air is in the
shed? (Take  = 22

MATHEMATICS
Solution : The volume of air inside the shed (when there are no people or machinery)
is given by the volume of air inside the cuboid and inside the half cylinder, taken
together.
Now, the length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 m, 7 m and 8 m, respectively.
Also, the diameter of the half cylinder is 7 m and its height is 15 m.
So, the required volume = volume of the cuboid + 1

 = 1128.75 m3
Next, the total space occupied by the machinery = 300 m3
And the total space occupied by the workers = 20 × 0.08 m3 = 1.6 m3
Therefore, the volume of the air, when there are machinery and workers
= 1128.75 – (300.00 + 1.60) = 827.15 m3
Example 6 : A juice seller was serving his
customers using glasses as shown in Fig. 12.13.
The inner diameter of the cylindrical glass was
5 cm, but the bottom of the glass had a
hemispherical raised portion which reduced the
capacity of the glass. If the height of a glass
was 10 cm, find the apparent capacity of the
glass and its actual capacity. (Use  = 3.14.)
Solution : Since the inner diameter of the glass = 5 cm and height = 10 cm,
the apparent capacity of the glass = r2h
= 3.14 × 2.5 × 2.5 × 10 cm3 = 196.25 cm3
But the actual capacity of the glass is less by the volume of the hemisphere at the
base of the glass.

13.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you have studied the classification of given data into ungrouped as well as
grouped frequency distributions. You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially
in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying
widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain
numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central
tendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study
of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of
grouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the
cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called
ogives.
13.2 Mean of Grouped Data
The mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the
observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if
x1, x2,. . ., xn are observations with respective frequencies f1, f2, . . ., fn, then this
means observation x1 occurs f1 times, x2 occurs f2 times, and so on.
Now, the sum of the values of all the observations = f1x1 + f2x2 + . . . + fnxn,  and
the number of observations = f1 + f2 + . . . + fn.
So, the mean x  of the data is given by

Let us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example.

Therefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3.
In most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful
study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped
data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.
Let us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming
class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each
class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next
class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class-
interval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped
frequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).
Table 13.2

Now, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the
representative of the whole class. It is assumed that the frequency of each class-
interval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each
class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we
find the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and
lower limits. That is,
Class mark = Upper class limit + Lower class limit
2
With reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is 10
25
2
+
, i.e.,
17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put
them in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our xi’s. Now, in general, for the ith
class interval, we have the frequency fi corresponding to the class mark xi. We can
now proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.

This new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method.
We observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the
same formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different.
Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the
two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact
mean, while 62 an approximate mean.
Sometimes when the numerical values of xi and fi are large, finding the product
of xi and fi becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of
a method of reducing these calculations.
We can do nothing with the fi’s, but we can change each xi to a smaller number
so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a
fixed number from each of these xi’s? Let us try this method.
The first step is to choose one among the xi’s as the assumed mean, and denote
it by ‘a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘a’ to be that xi
which lies in the centre of x1, x2, . . ., xn. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let
us choose a = 47.5.
The next step is to find the difference di between a and each of the xi’s, that is,
the deviation of ‘a’ from each of the xi’s.
i.e.,
di = xi – a = xi – 47.5

The third step is to find the product of di with the corresponding fi, and take the sum
of all the fi di’s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4.

Now, let us find the relation between d  and x .
Since in obtaining di, we subtracted ‘a’ from each xi, so, in order to get the mean

Therefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62.
The method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method.
Activity 1 : From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of xi (i.e., 17.5, 32.5,
and so on) as ‘a’. What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in
each case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?)
So, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the
choice of ‘a’.
Observe that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if
we divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to
multiply with fi. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.)
So, let ui = 
ix
a
h
−
, where a is the assumed mean and h is the class size.
Now, we calculate ui in this way and continue as before (i.e., find fi ui and
then Σfiui). Taking h = 15, let us form Table 13.5.

So, the mean marks obtained by a student is 62.
The method discussed above is called the Step-deviation method.
We note that :
the step-deviation method will be convenient to apply if all the di’s have a
common factor.
The mean obtained by all the three methods is the same.
The assumed mean method and step-deviation method are just simplified
forms of the direct method.

Therefore, the mean percentage of female teachers in the primary schools of

Remark : The result obtained by all the three methods is the same. So the choice of
method to be used depends on the numerical values of xi and fi. If xi and fi are
sufficiently small, then the direct method is an appropriate choice. If xi and fi are
numerically large numbers, then we can go for the assumed mean method or
step-deviation method. If the class sizes are unequal, and xi are large numerically, we
can still apply the step-deviation method by taking h to be a suitable divisor of all the di’s.

13.3 Mode of Grouped Data
Recall from Class IX, a mode is that value among the observations which occurs most
often, that is, the value of the observation having the maximum frequency. Further, we
discussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining
a mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same
maximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal.  Though
grouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a
single mode only.
Let us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following
example.
Example 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:

MATHEMATICS
Clearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number
(i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2.
In a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by
looking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum
frequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is
given by the formula:
Mode =

where l = lower limit of the modal class,
h = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal),
f1 = frequency of the modal class,
f0 = frequency of the class preceding the modal class,
f2 = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.
Let us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula.
Example 5 : A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students
resulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a
household:

Find the mode of this data.
Solution : Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this
frequency is 3 – 5. So, the modal class is 3 – 5.
Now
modal class = 3 – 5, lower limit (l) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2
frequency ( f1) of the modal class = 8,
frequency ( f0) of class preceding the modal class = 7,
frequency ( f2) of class succeeding the modal class = 2.
Now, let us substitute these values in the formula :

Therefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286.
Example 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are
given in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and
interpret the mode and the mean.
Solution : Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students
(i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore,
the lower limit (l) of the modal class = 40,
the class size (h) = 15,
the frequency ( f1) of modal class = 7,
the frequency ( f0) of the class preceding the modal class = 3,
the frequency ( f2) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6.
Now, using the formula:
Mode =

 = 52
So, the mode marks is 52.
Now, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62.
So, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a
student obtained 62 marks.
Remarks :
1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may
be equal or more than the mean also.
2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the
average marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most

the mode is required.
Activity 3 : Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations
assigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data. They should also
compare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both.
Remark : The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes.
However, we shall not be discussing it.

13.4 Median of Grouped Data
As you have studied in Class IX, the median is a measure of central tendency which
gives the value of the middle-most observation in the data. Recall that for finding the
median of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in
ascending order. Then, if n is odd, the median is the

Remark : The part of Table 13.11 consisting Column 1 and Column 3 is known as
Cumulative Frequency Table. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that
about 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained
marks more than 28.5.
Now, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following
situation.
Consider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53
students, in a certain examination, as follows:

From the table above, try to answer the following questions:
How many students have scored marks less than 10? The answer is clearly 5.
Reprint 2025-26
STATISTICS
191
How many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number
of students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have
scored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks
from 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8.
We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10 -20 is 8.
Similarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e.,
the number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We
give them in Table 13.13 given below:

15 + 3 = 18
Less than 60
18 + 4 = 22
Less than 70
22 + 7 = 29
Less than 80
29 + 9 = 38
Less than 90
38 + 7 = 45
Less than 100
45 + 8 = 53
The distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of
the less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective
class intervals.
We can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more
than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From
Table 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to
0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there
are 53 – 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the
same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 – 3 = 45, 30 or
above as 45 – 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14.

Now, to find the median of grouped data, we can make use of any of these
cumulative frequency distributions.
Let us combine Tables 13.12 and 13.13 to get Table 13.15 given below:

a class interval. It is, therefore, necessary to find the value inside a class that divides
the whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be?
To find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and 2
n .
We now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to)
2
n  This is called the median class. In the distribution above, n = 53. So, 2
n  = 26.5.
Now 60 – 70 is the class whose cumulative frequency 29 is greater than (and nearest
to) 2
n , i.e., 26.5.
Therefore, 60 – 70 is the median class.
After finding the median class, we use the following formula for calculating the

Find the median height.
Solution : To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their
corresponding frequencies.
The given distribution being of the less than type, 140, 145, 150, . . ., 165 give the
upper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140,
140 - 145, 145 - 150, . . ., 160 - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find
that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class interval
below 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with
height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval
140 - 145 is 11 – 4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 – 11 = 18, for
150 - 155, it is 40 – 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution  table with the
given cumulative frequencies becomes:

Now, that you have studied about all the three measures of central tendency, let
us discuss which measure would be best suited for a particular requirement.
The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it
takes into account all the observations, and lies between the extremes, i.e., the largest
and the smallest observations of the entire data. It also enables us to compare two or
more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students
of different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a
better performance.
However, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of
classes having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data.
But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,
21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such
cases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.
In problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find
out a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical
productivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations
where extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as
a better measure of central tendency.
In situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular
item, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.V. programme being
watched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by
most of the people, etc.
Remarks :
1. There is a empirical relationship between the three measures of central tendency :
3 Median = Mode + 2 Mean
2. The median of grouped data with unequal class sizes can also be calculated. However,
we shall not discuss it here.

The theory of probabilities and the theory of errors now constitute
a formidable body of great mathematical interest and of great
practical importance.
– R.S. Woodward
14.1 Probability — A Theoretical Approach
Let us consider the following situation :
Suppose a coin is tossed at random.
When we speak of a coin, we assume it to be ‘fair’, that is, it is symmetrical so
that there is no reason for it to come down more often on one side than the other.
We call this property of the coin as being ‘unbiased’. By the phrase ‘random toss’,
we mean that the coin is allowed to fall freely without any bias or interference.
We know, in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways —
either head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which
may be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each
outcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other. We refer to this by saying that
the outcomes head and tail, are equally likely.
For another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die
once. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes?
They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So
the equally likely outcomes of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Are the outcomes of every experiment equally likely? Let us see.
Suppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball
without looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball
and a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, you
would agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes
(a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a
ball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarily
have equally likely outcomes.
However, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments
have equally likely outcomes.
In Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an
event E as
P(E) = Number of trials in which the event happened
Total number of trials
The empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated
with an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement
of repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive or
unfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwing
experiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in order
to compute the empirical probability of its failure during launching, or the repetition of
the phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi-
storeyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?
In experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition
of an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating the
exact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which is
valid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is one
such assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event.
The theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event E,
written as P(E), is defined as
P(E) = 
Number of outcomes favourable to E
Number of all possible outcomes of the experiment
,
where we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.
We will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability.
This definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795.

MATHEMATICS
Probability theory had its origin in the 16th century when
an Italian physician and mathematician J.Cardan wrote the
first book on the subject, The Book on Games of Chance.
Since its inception, the study of probability has attracted
the attention of great mathematicians. James Bernoulli
(1654 – 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 – 1754), and
Pierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significant
contributions to this field. Laplace’s Theorie Analytique
des Probabilités, 1812, is considered to be the greatest
contribution by a single person to the theory of probability.
In recent years, probability has been used extensively in
many areas such as biology, economics, genetics, physics,
sociology etc.
Let us find the probability for some of the events associated with experiments
where the equally likely assumption holds.
Example 1 : Find the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once. Also
find the probability of getting a tail.
Solution : In the experiment of tossing a coin once, the number of possible outcomes
is two — Head (H) and Tail (T). Let E be the event ‘getting a head’. The number of
outcomes favourable to E, (i.e., of getting a head) is 1. Therefore,
P(E) = P (head) = Number of outcomes favourable to E
Number of all possible outcomes
 = 1
2
Similarly, if F is the event ‘getting a tail’, then
P(F) = P(tail) = 1

(Why ?)
Example 2 : A bag contains a red ball, a blue ball and a yellow ball, all the balls being
of the same size. Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. What is
the probability that she takes out the
(i) yellow ball?
(ii) red ball?
(iii) blue ball?
Solution : Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. So, it is equally
likely that she takes out any one of them.

Let Y be the event ‘the ball taken out is yellow’, B be the event ‘the ball taken
out is blue’, and R be the event ‘the ball taken out is red’.
Now, the number of possible outcomes = 3.
(i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event Y = 1.
So,
P(Y) = 1

Similarly,
(ii) P(R) = 1

Remarks :
1. An event having only one outcome of the experiment is called an elementary
event. In Example 1, both the events E and F are elementary events. Similarly, in
Example 2, all the three events, Y, B and R are elementary events.
2. In Example 1, we note that : P(E) + P(F) = 1
In Example 2, we note that : P(Y) + P(R) + P(B) = 1
Observe that the sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of
an experiment is 1. This is true in general also.
Example 3 : Suppose we throw a die once. (i) What is the probability of getting a
number greater than 4 ? (ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than or
equal to 4 ?
Solution : (i) Here, let E be the event ‘getting a number greater than 4’. The number
of possible outcomes is six : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and the outcomes favourable to E are 5
and 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 2. So,
P(E) = P(number greater than 4) = 2
6  = 1

(ii) Let F be the event ‘getting a number less than or equal to 4’.
Number of possible outcomes = 6
Outcomes favourable to the event F are 1, 2, 3, 4.
So, the number of outcomes favourable to F is 4.
Therefore,
P(F) = 4

Are the events E and F in the example above elementary events? No, they are
not because the event E has 2 outcomes and the event F has 4 outcomes.

where E is the event ‘getting a number >4’ and F is the event ‘getting a number  4’.
Note that getting a number not greater than 4 is same as getting a number less

In (1) and (2) above, is F not the same as ‘not E’? Yes, it is. We denote the event
‘not E’ by E .
So,
P(E) + P(not E) = 1
i.e.,
P(E) + P( E ) = 1,
which gives us
P( E ) = 1 – P(E).
In general, it is true that for an event E,
P( E ) = 1 – P(E)
The event E , representing ‘not E’, is called the complement of the event E.
We also say that E and E  are complementary events.
Before proceeding further, let us try to find the answers to the following questions:
(i) What is the probability of getting a number 8 in a single throw of a die?
(ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than 7 in a single throw of a die?
Let us answer (i) :
We know that there are only six possible outcomes in a single throw of a die. These
outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Since no face of the die is marked 8, so there is no
outcome favourable to 8, i.e., the number of such outcomes is zero. In other words,
getting 8 in a single throw of a die, is impossible.
So,
P(getting 8) = 0
6  = 0
Reprint 2025-26
PROBABILITY
207
That is, the probability of an event which is impossible to occur is 0. Such an
event is called an impossible event.
Let us answer (ii) :
Since every face of a die is marked with a number less than 7, it is sure that we
will always get a number less than 7 when it is thrown once. So, the number of
favourable outcomes is the same as the number of all possible outcomes, which is 6.
Therefore,
P(E) = P(getting a number less than 7) = 6
6  = 1
So, the probability of an event which is sure (or certain) to occur is 1. Such an event
is called a sure event or a certain event.
Note : From the definition of the probability P(E), we see that the numerator (number
of outcomes favourable to the event E) is always less than or equal to the denominator
(the number of all possible outcomes). Therefore,
0  P(E)  1
Now, let us take an example related to playing cards. Have you seen a deck of
playing cards? It consists of 52 cards which are divided into 4 suits of 13 cards each—
spades (), hearts (), diamonds () and clubs (). Clubs and spades are of black
colour, while hearts and diamonds are of red colour. The cards in each suit are ace,
king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2. Kings, queens and jacks are called face
cards.
Example 4 : One card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. Calculate the
probability that the card will
(i) be an ace,
(ii) not be an ace.
Solution : Well-shuffling ensures equally likely outcomes.
(i) There are 4 aces in a deck. Let E be the event ‘the card is an ace’.

Example 6 : Savita and Hamida are friends. What is the probability that both will

Solution : Out of the two friends, one girl, say, Savita’s birthday can be any day of the
year. Now, Hamida’s birthday can also be any day of 365 days in the year.
We assume that these 365 outcomes are equally likely.
(i) If Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s, the number of favourable outcomes
for her birthday is 365 – 1 = 364
So, P (Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s birthday) = 364

Example 9 : Harpreet tosses two different coins simultaneously (say, one is of ` 1

Solution : We write H for ‘head’ and T for ‘tail’. When two coins are tossed
simultaneously, the possible outcomes are (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T), which are all
equally likely. Here (H, H) means head up on the first coin (say on ` 1) and head up
on the second coin (` 2). Similarly (H, T) means head up on the first coin and tail up on
the second coin and so on.
The outcomes favourable to the event E, ‘at least one head’ are (H, H), (H, T)

Did you observe that in all the examples discussed so far, the number of possible
outcomes in each experiment was finite? If not, check it now.
There are many experiments in which the outcome is any number between two
given numbers, or in which the outcome is every point within a circle or rectangle, etc.
Can you now count the number of all possible outcomes? As you know, this is not
possible since there are infinitely many numbers between two given numbers, or there
are infinitely many  points within a circle. So, the definition of (theoretical) probability
which you have learnt so far cannot be applied in the present form. What is the way
out? To answer this, let us consider the following example :
Example 10* : In a musical chair game, the person playing the music has been
advised to stop playing the music at any time within 2 minutes after she starts
playing. What is the probability that the music will stop within the first half-minute
after starting?
Solution : Here the possible outcomes are all the numbers between 0 and 2. This is

A NOTE TO THE READER
The experimental or empirical probability of an event is based on
what has actually happened while the theoretical probability of the
event attempts to predict what will happen on the basis of certain
assumptions. As the number of trials in an experiment, go on
increasing we may expect the experimental and theoretical
probabilities to be nearly the same.
25. Which of the following arguments are correct and which are not correct? Give reasons
for your answer.
(i) If two coins are tossed simultaneously there are three possible outcomes—two
heads, two tails or one of each. Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the
probability is 1
3
(ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes—an odd number or an even
number. Therefore, the probability of getting an odd number is 1
2 .
14.2 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points :
1. The theoretical (classical) probability of an event E, written as P(E), is defined as
P (E) = 
Number of outcomes favourable to E
Number of all possible outcomes of the experiment
where we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.
2. The probability of a sure event (or certain event) is 1.
3. The probability of an impossible event is 0.
4. The probability of an event E is a number P(E) such that
0  P (E)  1
5. An event having only one outcome is called an elementary event. The sum of the
probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1.
6. For any event E, P (E) + P ( E ) = 1, where E  stands for ‘not E’. E and E  are called
complementary events.

There is perhaps nothing which so occupies the
middle position of mathematics as trigonometry.
– J.F. Herbart (1890)
8.1 Introduction
You have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in your
earlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles
can be imagined to be formed. For instance :
1. Suppose the students of a school are
visiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student
is looking at the top of the Minar, a right
triangle can be imagined to be made,
as shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student
find out the height of the Minar, without
actually measuring it?
    2.  Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony
of her house located on the bank of a
river.  She is looking down at a flower
pot placed on a stair of a temple situated
nearby on the other bank of the river.
A right triangle is imagined to be made
in this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If
you know the height at which the
person is sitting, can you find the width
of the river?

3. Suppose a hot air balloon is flying in
the air.  A girl happens to spot the
balloon in the sky and runs to her
mother to tell her about it.  Her mother
rushes out of the house to look at the
balloon.Now when the girl had spotted
the balloon intially it was at point A.
When both the mother and daughter
came out to see it, it had already
travelled to another point B. Can you
find the altitude of B from the ground?
In all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using
some mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called
‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’
(meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact,
trigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle.
The earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early
astronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth.
Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and
Physical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.
In this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with
respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict
our discussion to acute angles only. However, these  ratios can be extended to other
angles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and
90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish
some identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.
8.2 Trigonometric Ratios
In Section 8.1, you have seen some right triangles
imagined to be formed in different situations.
Let us take a right triangle ABC as shown
in Fig. 8.4.
Here,  CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an
acute angle. Note the position of the side BC
with respect to angle A. It faces  A. We call it
the side opposite to angle A. AC is the
hypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB
is a part of  A. So, we call it the side
adjacent to angle A.

Note that the position of sides change
when you consider angle C in place of A
(see Fig. 8.5).
You have studied the concept of ‘ratio’ in
your earlier classes. We now define certain ratios
involving the sides of a right triangle, and call
them trigonometric ratios.
The trigonometric ratios of the angle A
in right triangle ABC (see Fig. 8.4) are defined
as follows :
sine of  A = side opposite to angle A
BC
hypotenuse
AC

cosine of  A = side adjacent to angle A

The ratios defined above are abbreviated as sin A, cos A, tan A, cosec A, sec A
and cot A respectively. Note that the ratios cosec A, sec A and cot A are respectively,
the reciprocals of the ratios sin A, cos A and tan A.
Also, observe that tan A =

 and cot A = cosA

So, the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle in a right triangle express the
relationship between the angle and the length of its sides.
Why don’t you try to define the trigonometric ratios for angle C in the right
triangle? (See Fig. 8.5)

MATHEMATICS
The first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use
it today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata,
in A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya
for the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or
jiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was
translated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as
it is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which
means curve, when the Arabic version was translated
into Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine,
became common in mathematical texts throughout
Europe. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund
Gunter (1581–1626), first used the abbreviated
notation ‘sin’.
The origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function
arose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta
called it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the
English Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.
Remark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an
abbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is not
the product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from A
has no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of
‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for other
trigonometric ratios also.
Now, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse
AC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle
ABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN
perpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how
will the trigonometric ratios of  A in  PAM differ
from those of  A in  CAB or from those of  A in
 QAN?
To answer this, first look at these triangles. Is  PAM similar to  CAB? From
Chapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that the
triangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles,
the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.
So, we have

Similarly,

 and so on.
This shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in  PAM not differ from
those of angle A in  CAB.
In the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other
trigonometric ratios) remains the same in  QAN also.
From our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric
ratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if
the angle remains the same.
Note : For the sake of convenience, we may write sin2A, cos2A, etc., in place of
(sin A)2, (cos A)2, etc., respectively. But cosec A = (sin A)–1  sin–1 A (it is called sine
inverse A). sin–1 A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes.
Similar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the
Greek letter  (theta) is also used to denote an angle.
We have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one
of the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see.
If in a right triangle ABC, sin A = 1,

then this means that BC

, i.e., the
lengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangle
ABC are in the ratio 1 : 3 (see Fig. 8.7). So if
BC is equal to k, then AC will be 3k, where
k is any positive number. To determine other
trigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third side
AB. Do you remember the Pythagoras theorem? Let us use it to determine the
required length AB.
AB2 = AC2 – BC2 = (3k)2 – (k)2 = 8k2 = (2
2 k)2
Therefore,
AB =
2 2 k

So, we get
AB = 2 2 k
(Why is AB not – 2 2 k ?)

Remark : Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, the value of
sin A or cos A is always less than 1 (or, in particular, equal to 1).
Let us consider some examples.
Example 1 : Given tan A = 4

trigonometric ratios of the angle A.

Therefore, if BC = 4k, then AB = 3k, where k is a

Now, by using the Pythagoras Theorem, we have

So,
AC = 5k

Trigonometric Ratios of 0° and 90°
Let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of angle
A, if it is made smaller and smaller in the right triangle ABC
(see Fig. 8.16), till it becomes zero. As  A gets smaller and
smaller, the length of the side BC decreases.The point C gets
closer to point B, and finally when  A becomes very close
to 0°, AC becomes almost the same as AB (see Fig. 8.17).

When  A is very close to 0°, BC gets very close to 0 and so the value of
sin A = BC
AC  is very close to 0. Also, when  A is very close to 0°, AC is nearly the
same as AB and so the value of cos A = AB
AC  is very close to 1.
This helps us to see how we can define the values of sin A and cos A when
A = 0°. We define : sin 0° = 0 and cos 0° = 1.
Using these, we have :
tan 0° = sin 0°
cos 0°  = 0, cot 0° = 
1

tan 0°  which is not defined. (Why?)
sec 0° =

cos 0 = 1 and cosec 0° =

,
sin 0 which is again not defined.(Why?)
Now, let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of  A, when it is made
larger and larger in  ABC till it becomes 90°. As  A gets larger and larger,  C gets
smaller and smaller. Therefore, as in the case above, the length of the side AB goes on
decreasing. The point A gets closer to point B. Finally when  A is very close to 90°,
 C becomes very close to 0° and the side AC almost coincides with side BC
(see Fig. 8.18).
Fig. 8.18
When  C is very close to 0°,  A is very close to 90°, side AC is nearly the
same as side BC, and so sin A is very close to 1. Also when  A is very close to 90°,
 C is very close to 0°, and the side AB is nearly zero, so cos A is very close to 0.
So, we define :
sin 90° = 1 and cos 90° = 0.
Now, why don’t you find the other trigonometric ratios of 90°?
We shall now give the values of all the trigonometric ratios of 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°
and 90° in Table 8.1, for ready reference.

Let us illustrate the use of the values in the table above through some examples.
Example 6 : In  ABC, right-angled at B,
AB = 5 cm and  ACB = 30° (see Fig. 8.19).
Determine the lengths of the sides BC and AC.
Solution : To find the length of the side BC, we will
choose the trigonometric ratio involving BC and the
given side AB. Since BC is the side adjacent to angle
C and AB is the side opposite to angle C, therefore
AB
BC  = tan C
i.e.,

BC  = tan 30° = 
1

which gives
BC = 5 3  cm

Example 7 : In  PQR, right-angled at

Therefore,

So,
 PRQ = 30°
and therefore,

You may note that if one of the sides and any other part (either an acute angle or any
side) of a right triangle is known, the remaining sides and angles of the triangle can be
determined.
Example 8 : If sin (A – B) = 1 ,
2  cos (A + B) = 1 ,
2  0° < A + B  90°, A > B, find A
and B.
Solution : Since, sin (A – B) = 1

Also, since cos (A + B) = 1

Solving (1) and (2), we get : A = 45° and B = 15°.

8.4 Trigonometric Identities
You may recall that an equation is called an identity
when it is true for all values of the variables involved.
Similarly, an equation involving trigonometric ratios
of an angle is called a trigonometric identity, if it is
true for all values of the angle(s) involved.
In this section, we will prove one trigonometric
identity, and use it further to prove other useful
trigonometric identities.
In  ABC, right-angled at B (see Fig. 8.21), we have:
AB2 + BC2 = AC2

This is true for all A such that 0°  A  90°. So, this is a trigonometric identity.
Let us now divide (1) by AB2. We get

Is this equation true for A = 0°? Yes, it is. What about A = 90°? Well, tan A and
sec A are not defined for A = 90°. So, (3) is true for all A such that 0°  A  90°.

(4)
Note that cosec A and cot A are not defined for A = 0°. Therefore (4) is true for
all A such that 0° < A  90°.
Using these identities, we can express each trigonometric ratio in terms of other
trigonometric ratios, i.e., if any one of the ratios is known, we can also determine the
values of other trigonometric ratios.
Let us see how we can do this using these identities. Suppose we know that
tan A =

9.1 Heights and Distances
In the previous chapter, you have studied about trigonometric ratios. In this chapter,
you will be studying about some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around
you.
Let us consider Fig. 8.1 of prvious chapter, which is redrawn below in Fig. 9.1.
Fig. 9.1
In this figure, the line AC drawn from the eye of the student to the top of the
minar is called the line of sight. The student is looking at the top of the minar. The
angle BAC, so formed by the line of sight with the horizontal, is called the angle of
elevation of the top of the minar from the eye of the student.
Thus, the line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point
in the object viewed by the observer. The angle of elevation of the point viewed is

MATHEMATICS
the angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is
above the horizontal level, i.e., the case when we raise our head to look at the object
(see Fig. 9.2).
Fig. 9.2
Now, consider the situation given in Fig. 8.2. The girl sitting on the balcony is
looking down at a flower pot placed on a stair of the temple. In this case, the line of
sight is below the horizontal level. The angle so formed by the line of sight with the
horizontal is called the angle of depression.
Thus, the angle of depression of a point on the object being viewed is the angle
formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal
level, i.e., the case when we lower our head to look at the point being viewed
(see Fig. 9.3).
Fig. 9.3
Now, you may identify the lines of sight, and the angles so formed in Fig. 8.3.
Are they angles of elevation or angles of depression?
Let us refer to Fig. 9.1 again. If you want to find the height CD of the minar
without actually measuring it, what information do you need? You would need to know
the following:
(i) the distance DE at which the student is standing from the foot of the minar
Reprint 2025-26
SOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY
135
(ii) the angle of elevation,  BAC, of the top of the minar
(iii) the height AE of the student.
Assuming that the above three conditions are known, how can we determine the
height of the minar?
In the figure, CD = CB + BD. Here, BD = AE, which is the height of the student.
To find BC, we will use trigonometric ratios of  BAC or  A.
In  ABC, the side BC is the opposite side in relation to the known  A. Now,
which of the trigonometric ratios can we use? Which one of them has the two values
that we have and the one we need to determine? Our search narrows down to using
either tan A or cot A, as these ratios involve AB and BC.
Therefore,
tan A = BC
AB or cot A = AB,
BC  which on solving would give us BC.
By adding AE to BC, you will get the height of the minar.
Now let us explain the process, we have just discussed, by solving some problems.
Example 1 : A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground,
which is 15 m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the
tower is found to be 60°. Find the height of the tower.
Solution : First let us draw a simple diagram to
represent the problem (see Fig. 9.4). Here AB
represents the tower, CB is the distance of the point
from the tower and  ACB is the angle of elevation.
We need to determine the height of the tower, i.e.,
AB. Also, ACB is a triangle, right-angled at B.
To solve the problem, we choose the trigonometric
ratio tan 60° (or cot 60°), as the ratio involves AB
and BC.
Now,
tan 60° = AB
BC
i.e.,
3  = AB
15
i.e.,
AB = 15 3
Hence, the height of the tower is 15 3  m.

MATHEMATICS
Example 2 : An electrician has to repair an
electric fault on a pole of height 5 m. She needs
to reach a point 1.3m below the top of the pole
to undertake the repair work (see Fig. 9.5). What
should be the length of the ladder that she should
use which, when inclined at an angle of 60° to
the horizontal, would enable her to reach the
required position? Also, how far from the foot
of the pole should she place the foot of the
ladder? (You may take 
3  = 1.73)
Solution : In Fig. 9.5, the electrician is required to
reach the point B on the pole AD.
So, 
BD = AD – AB = (5 – 1.3)m = 3.7 m.
Here, BC represents the ladder. We need to find
its length, i.e., the hypotenuse of the right triangle BDC.
Now, can you think which trigonometic ratio should we consider?
It should be sin 60°.
So,
BD
BC  = sin 60° or 3.7
BC  = 
3
2
Therefore,
BC = 3.7


 = 4.28 m (approx.)
i.e., the length of the ladder should be 4.28 m.
Now,
DC
BD  = cot 60° = 1
3
i.e.,
DC =
3.7
3  = 2.14 m (approx.)
Therefore, she should place the foot of the ladder at a distance of 2.14 m from
the pole.

Example 3 : An observer 1.5 m tall is 28.5 m away
from a chimney. The angle of elevation of the top
of the chimney from her eyes is 45°. What is the
height of the chimney?
Solution : Here, AB is the chimney, CD the
observer and  ADE the angle of elevation (see
Fig. 9.6). In this case, ADE is a triangle, right-angled
at E and we are required to find the height of the
chimney.
We have
AB =  AE + BE = AE + 1.5
and
 DE =  CB = 28.5 m
To determine AE, we choose a trigonometric ratio, which involves both AE and
DE. Let us choose the tangent of the angle of elevation.
Now,
tan 45° = AE
DE
i.e.,
1 =
AE
28.5
Therefore,
AE = 28.5
So the height of the chimney (AB) = (28.5 + 1.5) m = 30 m.
Example 4 : From a point P on the ground the angle of elevation of the top of a 10 m
tall building is 30°. A flag is hoisted at the top of the building and the angle of elevation
of the top of the flagstaff from P is 45°. Find the length of the flagstaff and the
distance of the building from the point P. (You may take 
3  = 1.732)
Solution : In Fig. 9.7, AB denotes the height of the building, BD the flagstaff and P
the given point. Note that there are two right triangles PAB and PAD. We are required
to find the length of the flagstaff, i.e., DB and the distance of the building from the
point P, i.e., PA.

We have

AP
Therefore,
AP = 10 3
i.e., the distance of the building from P is 10 3  m = 17.32 m.
Next, let us suppose DB = x m. Then AD = (10 + x) m.

So, the length of the flagstaff is 7.32 m.
Example 5 : The shadow of a tower standing
on a level ground is found to be 40 m longer
when the Sun’s altitude is 30° than when it is
60°. Find the height of the tower.
Solution : In Fig. 9.8, AB is the tower and
BC is the length of the shadow when the
Sun’s altitude is 60°, i.e., the angle of
elevation of the top of the tower from the tip
of the shadow is 60° and DB is the length of
the shadow, when the angle of elevation
is 30°.
Now, let AB be h m and BC be x m. According to the question, DB is 40 m longer
than BC.

So,

[From (1)]
Therefore, the height of the tower is 20 3 m.
Example 6 : The angles of depression of the top and the bottom of an 8 m tall building
from the top of a multi-storeyed building are 30°
and 45°, respectively. Find the height of the multi-

Solution : In Fig. 9.9, PC denotes the multi-

10.1 Introduction
You have studied in Class IX that a circle is a collection of all points in a plane
which are at a constant distance (radius) from a fixed point (centre). You have
also studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc.
Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line
are given in a plane.
So, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given
in Fig. 10.1 below:
Fig. 10.1
In Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case,
PQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there
are two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we
call the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point A which
is common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the
circle.

You might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used
in taking out water from the well. Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope
on both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent
to the circle representing the pulley.
Is there any position of the line with respect to the circle
other than the types given above? You can see that there cannot
be any other type of position of the line with respect  to the circle.
In this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangents
to a circle and also study some of their properties.
10.2 Tangent to a Circle
In the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that
intersects the circle at only one point.
To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform
the following activities:
Activity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the
circular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table
and gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight
wire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].
In various positions, the wire intersects the
circular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or
Q3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will
intersect the circle at the point P only (see position
AB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at
the point P of the circle. On rotating further, you
can observe that in all other positions of AB, it will
intersect the circle at P and at another point, say R1
or R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is
only one tangent at a point of the circle.
While doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB
moves towards the position A B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the
circle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides
with the point P in the position AB of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is
rotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer
to P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:
The tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end
points of its corresponding chord coincide.

*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was
introduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.

MATHEMATICS
Activity 2 : On a paper, draw a circle and a
secant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines
parallel to the secant on both sides of it. You
will find that after some steps, the length of
the chord cut by the lines will gradually
decrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of
the line and the circle are coming closer and
closer [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it
becomes zero on one side of the secant and in
another case, it becomes zero on the other side
of the secant. See the positions PQ and PQ
of the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the
tangents to the circle parallel to the given secant
PQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot
be more than two tangents parallel to a given
secant.
This activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing
Activity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the
corresponding chord coincide.
The common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact
[the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch the circle at the
common point.
Now look around you. Have you seen a bicycle
or a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes
of a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position
of the wheel with respect to its movement on the
ground. Do you see any tangent anywhere?
(See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line
which is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel.
Also, notice that in all positions, the radius through
the point of contact with the ground appears to be at
right angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shall
now prove this property of the tangent.
Theorem 10.1 : The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the
radius through the point of contact.
Proof : We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a
point P. We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY.

Take a point Q on XY other than P and join OQ (see Fig. 10.5).
The point Q must lie outside the circle.
(Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY
will become a secant and not a tangent to the
circle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius
OP of the circle. That is,
OQ > OP.
Since this happens for every point on the
line XY except the point P, OP is the
shortest of all the distances of the point O to the
points of XY. So OP is perpendicular to XY.
(as shown in Theorem A1.7.)
Remarks
1. By theorem above, we can also conclude that at any point on a circle there can be
one and only one tangent.
2. The line containing the radius through the point of contact is also sometimes called
the ‘normal’ to the circle at the point.

10.3 Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle
To get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the
following activity:

MATHEMATICS
Activity 3 : Draw a circle on a paper. Take a
point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the
circle through this point? You will find that all
the lines through this point intersect the circle in
two points. So, it is not possible to draw any
tangent to a circle through a point inside it
[see Fig. 10.6 (i)].
Next take a point P on the circle and draw
tangents through this point. You have already
observed that there is only one tangent to the
circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].
Finally, take a point P outside the circle and
try to draw tangents to the circle from this point.
What do you observe? You will find that you
can draw exactly two tangents to the circle
through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].
We can summarise these facts as follows:
Case 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing
through a point lying inside the circle.
Case 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a
circle passing through a point lying on the circle.
Case 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a
circle through a point lying outside the circle.
In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T1and T2 are the points of
contact of the tangents PT1 and PT2
respectively.
The length of the segment of the tangent
from the external point P and the point of contact
with the circle is called the length of the tangent
from the point P to the circle.
Note that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT1 and PT2 are the lengths of the tangents from P to
the circle. The lengths PT1 and PT2 have a common property. Can you find this?
Measure PT1 and PT2. Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof
of this fact in the following theorem.

Theorem 10.2 : The lengths of tangents drawn
from an external point to a circle are equal.
Proof : We are given a circle with centre O, a
point P lying outside the circle and two tangents
PQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We
are required to prove that PQ = PR.
For this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then
∠ OQP and ∠ ORP are right angles, because
these are angles between the radii and tangents,
and according to Theorem 10.1 they are right
angles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,
OQ = OR
(Radii of the same circle)
OP = OP
(Common)
Therefore,
∆ OQP ≅∆ ORP
(RHS)
This gives
PQ = PR
(CPCT)
Remarks
1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:
PQ2 = OP2 – OQ2 = OP2 – OR2 = PR2 (As OQ = OR)
which gives PQ = PR.
2. Note also that ∠ OPQ = ∠ OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠ QPR,
i.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents.
Let us take some examples.
Example 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles,
the chord of the larger circle, which touches the
smaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact.
Solution : We are given two concentric circles
C1 and C2 with centre O and a chord AB of the
larger circle C1 which touches the smaller circle
C2 at the point P (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove
that AP = BP.
Let us join OP. Then, AB is a tangent to C2 at P
and OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1,
OP ⊥AB

Now AB is a chord of the circle C1 and OP  AB. Therefore, OP is the bisector of the
chord AB, as the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord,
i.e.,
AP = BP

to a circle with centre O from an external point T.
Prove that  PTQ = 2  OPQ.

Solution : Join OT. Let it intersect PQ at the
point R. Then  TPQ is isosceles and TO is the

11.1 Areas of Sector and Segment of a Circle
You have already come across the terms sector and
segment of a circle in your earlier classes. Recall
that the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed
by two radii and the corresponding arc is called a
sector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the
circular region enclosed between a chord and the
corresponding arc is called a segment of the circle.
Thus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector
of the circle with centre O. ∠ AOB is called the
angle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of
the circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and
OAQB is called the major sector. You can also see that angle of the major sector is
360° – ∠ AOB.
Now, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord
of the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is
a segment of the circle. You can also note that
unshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle
formed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB
is called the minor segment and AQB is called the
major segment.
Remark : When we write ‘segment’ and ‘sector’
we will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor
sector’ respectively, unless stated otherwise.

Now with this knowledge, let us try to find some
relations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.
Let OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre
O and radius r (see Fig. 11.3). Let the degree
measure of Ð AOB be q.
You know that area of a circle (in fact of a
circular region or disc) is pr2.
In a way, we can consider this circular region to
be a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree
measure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the
Unitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the
sector OAPB as follows:
When degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the
sector = pr2
So, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the
sector =

Therefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is q, area of the

Now, a natural question arises : Can we find
the length of the arc APB corresponding to this

Now let us take the case of the area of the

Let us now take some examples to understand these concepts (or results).

4.1 Introduction
In Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the
quadratic polynomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, a  0. When we equate this polynomial
to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with
many real-life situations. For instance, suppose a
charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having
a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length
one metre more than twice its breadth. What
should be the length and breadth of the hall?
Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then,
its length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict
this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.
Now,
area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m2 = (2x2 + x) m2
So,
2x2 + x = 300
(Given)
Therefore,
2x2 + x – 300 = 0
So, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 which is a
quadratic equation.
Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations.
For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum
and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic
equation of the form x2 – px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a
geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,
are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is
often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665)
gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx = c. Later,

Sridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,
(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing
the square. An  Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied
quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book
‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of
different quadratic equations.
In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding
their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life
situations.
4.2 Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b, c are real numbers, a  0. For example, 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation.
Similarly, 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0, 4x – 3x2 + 2 = 0 and 1 – x2 + 300 = 0 are also quadratic
equations.
In fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree
2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of
their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax2 + bx + c = 0,
a  0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.
Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in
different fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.
Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:
(i)
John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and
the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find
out how many marbles they had to start with.
(ii)
A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of
production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys
produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was
` 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.
Solution :
(i)
Let the number of marbles John had be x.
Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?).
The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5
The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 – x – 5
= 40 – x
Reprint 2025-26
40
MATHEMATICS
Therefore, their product = (x – 5) (40 – x)
= 40x – x2 – 200 + 5x
= – x2 + 45x – 200
So,
– x2 + 45x – 200 = 124
(Given that product = 124)
i.e.,
– x2 + 45x – 324 = 0
i.e.,
x2 – 45x + 324 = 0
Therefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation
x2 – 45x + 324 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
(ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x.
Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 – x
So, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 – x)
Therefore,
x (55 – x) = 750
i.e.,
55x – x2 = 750
i.e.,
– x2 + 55x – 750 = 0
i.e.,
x2 – 55x + 750 = 0
Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation
x2 – 55x + 750 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
(i) (x – 2)2 + 1 = 2x – 3
(ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)
(iii) x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1
(iv) (x + 2)3 = x3 – 4
Solution :
(i) LHS = (x – 2)2 + 1 = x2 – 4x + 4 + 1 = x2 – 4x + 5
Therefore, (x – 2)2 + 1 = 2x – 3 can be rewritten as
x2 – 4x + 5 = 2x – 3
i.e.,
x2 – 6x + 8 = 0
It is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
Therefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
Reprint 2025-26
QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
41
(ii)
Since x(x + 1) + 8 = x2 + x + 8 and (x + 2)(x – 2) = x2 – 4
Therefore,
x2 + x + 8 = x2 – 4
i.e.,
x + 12 = 0
It is not of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
Therefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation.
(iii) Here,
LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x2 + 3x
So,
x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1 can be rewritten as
2x2 + 3x = x2 + 1
Therefore, we get
x2 + 3x – 1 = 0
It is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
(iv) Here,
LHS = (x + 2)3 = x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8
Therefore,
(x + 2)3 = x3 – 4 can be rewritten as
x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8 = x3 – 4
i.e.,
6x2 + 12x + 12 = 0
or,
x2 + 2x + 2 = 0
It is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
Remark : Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic
equation, but it is not a quadratic equation.
In (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of
degree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As
you can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it
is quadratic or not.

(i) (x + 1)2 = 2(x – 3)
(ii) x2 – 2x = (–2) (3 – x)

(iv) (x – 3)(2x +1) = x(x + 5)

(iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been
8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We

4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation
Consider the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the
LHS of this equation, we get (2 × 12) – (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation.
We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that
1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x2 – 3x + 1.
In general, a real number  is called a root of the quadratic equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0, a  0 if a 2 + b + c = 0. We also say that x =  is a solution of
the quadratic equation, or that  satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the
zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic
equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are the same.
You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most
two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.
You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting
their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic
equation. Let us see how.
Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.
Solution : Let us first split the middle term – 5x as –2x –3x [because (–2x) × (–3x) =
6x2 = (2x2) × 3].
So,
2x2 – 5x + 3 = 2x2 – 2x – 3x + 3 = 2x (x – 1) –3(x – 1) = (2x – 3)(x – 1)
Now, 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0.
So, the values of x for which 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0,
i.e., either 2x – 3 = 0 or x – 1 = 0.
Now, 2x – 3 = 0 gives 
3
2
x 
 and x – 1 = 0 gives x = 1.
So, 
3
2
x 
 and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation.
In other words, 1 and 3
2  are the roots of the equation 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0.
Verify that these are the roots of the given equation.
Reprint 2025-26
QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
43
Note that we have found the roots of 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising
2x2 – 5x + 3 into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero.
Example 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x2 – x – 2 = 0.
Solution : We have
6x2 – x – 2 = 6x2 + 3x – 4x – 2
= 3x (2x + 1) – 2 (2x + 1)
= (3x – 2)(2x + 1)
The roots of 6x2 – x – 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3x – 2)(2x + 1) = 0
Therefore, 3x – 2 = 0 or 2x + 1 = 0,
i.e.,
x = 2

x =

Example 6 : Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1.
Solution : In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x
satisfies the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write
this equation as
2x2 – 24x + 25x – 300 = 0
2x (x – 12) + 25 (x – 12) = 0
i.e.,
(x – 12)(2x + 25) = 0
So, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x = – 12.5. Since x is the breadth
of the hall, it cannot be negative.
Thus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2x + 1 = 25 m.

Therefore, we say that the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has two equal

If b2 – 4ac < 0, then there is no real number whose square is b2 – 4ac. Therefore,
there are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case.
Since b2 – 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has
real roots or not, b2 – 4ac is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation.
So, a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has
(i) two distinct real roots, if b2 – 4ac > 0,
(ii) two equal real roots, if b2 – 4ac = 0,
(iii)  no real roots, if b2 – 4ac < 0.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 7: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 4x + 3 = 0, and
hence find the nature of its roots.
Solution : The given equation is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = – 4 and
c = 3. Therefore, the discriminant
b2 – 4ac = (– 4)2 – (4 × 2 × 3) = 16 – 24 = – 8 < 0
So, the given equation has no real roots.
Example 8 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of
diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two
diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to
do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected?
Solution : Let us first draw the diagram
(see Fig. 4.2).
Let P be the required location of the
pole. Let the distance of the pole from the
gate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the
difference of the distances of the pole from
the two gates = AP – BP (or, BP – AP) =
7 m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m.

Now, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter,
APB = 90°
(Why?)
Therefore,
AP2 + PB2 = AB2
(By Pythagoras theorem)
i.e.,
(x + 7)2 + x2 = 132
i.e.,
x2 + 14x + 49 + x2 = 169
i.e.,
2x2 + 14x – 120 = 0
So, the distance ‘x’ of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation
x2 + 7x – 60 = 0
So,  it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this
is so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is
b2 – 4ac = 72 – 4 × 1 × (– 60) = 289 > 0.
So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the
pole on the boundary of the park.
Solving the quadratic equation x2 + 7x – 60 = 0, by the quadratic formula, we get
x =

289

Therefore, x = 5 or – 12.
Since x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive.
Therefore, x = – 12 will have to be ignored. So, x = 5.
Thus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m
from the gate B and 12m from the gate A.
Example 9 : Find the discriminant of the equation 3x2 – 2x + 1
3  = 0 and hence find the
nature of its roots. Find them, if they are real.
Solution : Here a = 3, b = – 2 and

Therefore, discriminant b2 – 4ac = (– 2)2 – 4 × 3 × 1
3  = 4 – 4 = 0.
Hence, the given quadratic equation has two equal real roots.

5.1 Introduction
You must have observed that in nature, many things follow a certain pattern, such as
the petals of a sunflower, the holes of a honeycomb, the grains on a maize cob, the
spirals on a pineapple and on a pine cone, etc.
We now look for some patterns which occur in our day-to-day life. Some such
examples are :
(i) Reena applied for a job and got selected. She
has been offered a job with a starting monthly
salary of ` 8000, with an annual increment of
` 500 in her salary. Her salary (in `) for the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, . . . years will be, respectively
8000,
8500,
9000, . . . .
(ii) The lengths of the rungs of a ladder decrease
uniformly by 2 cm from bottom to top
(see Fig. 5.1). The bottom rung is 45 cm in
length. The lengths (in cm) of the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, . . ., 8th rung from the bottom to the top
are, respectively
45, 43, 41, 39, 37, 35, 33, 31
(iii) In a savings scheme, the amount becomes 5
4  times of itself after every 3 years.
The maturity amount (in `) of an investment of ` 8000 after 3, 6, 9 and 12 years
will be, respectively :

In the examples above, we observe some patterns. In some, we find that the
succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number, in other by multiplying
with a fixed number, in another we find that they are squares of consecutive
numbers, and so on.
In this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms
are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see how
to find their nth terms and the sum of n consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in
solving some daily life problems.
5.2 Arithmetic Progressions
Consider the following lists of numbers :
(i) 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
(ii) 100, 70, 40, 10, . . .
(iii) –3, –2, –1, 0, . . .
(iv) 3, 3, 3, 3, . . .
(v) –1.0, –1.5, –2.0, –2.5, . . .
Each of the numbers in the list is called a term.
Given a term, can you write the next term in each of the lists above? If so, how
will you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the
rule.
In (i), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it.
In (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it.
In (iii), each term is obtained by adding 1 to  the term preceding it.
In (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding
(or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it.
In (v), each term is obtained by adding – 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the
term preceding it.
In all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed
number to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an  Arithmetic
Progression ( AP ).
So, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term  is
obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first
term.
This fixed number is called the common difference of the AP. Remember that
it can be positive, negative or zero.

MATHEMATICS
Let us denote the first term of an AP by a1, second term by a2, . . ., nth term by
an and the common difference by d. Then the AP becomes a1, a2, a3, . . ., an.
So,
a2 – a1 = a3 – a2 = . . . = an – an – 1 = d.
Some more examples of AP are:
(a) The heights ( in cm ) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the
morning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, . . ., 157.
(b) The minimum temperatures ( in degree celsius ) recorded for a week in the
month of January in a city, arranged in ascending order are
– 3.1, – 3.0, – 2.9, – 2.8, – 2.7, – 2.6, – 2.5
(c) The balance money ( in ` ) after paying 5 % of the total  loan of ` 1000 every
month is 950, 900, 850, 800, . . ., 50.
(d) The cash prizes ( in ` ) given by a school to the toppers of Classes I to XII are,
respectively, 200, 250, 300, 350, . . ., 750.
(e) The total savings (in `) after every month for 10 months when ` 50 are saved
each month are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500.
It is left as an exercise for you to explain why each of the lists above is an AP.
You can see that
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . .
represents an arithmetic progression where a is the first term and d the common
difference. This is called the general form of an AP.
Note that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms.
Such an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions
(APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (i) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs
and so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions. Such APs do not have a
last term.
Now, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it
enough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference?
You will find that you will need to know both – the first term a and the common
difference d.
For instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then
the AP is
 6, 9,12, 15, . . .
and if a is 6 and d is – 3, then the AP is
6, 3, 0, –3, . . .

Similarly, when
a = – 7,
d = – 2,
the AP is  – 7, – 9, – 11, – 13, . . .
a =  1.0,
d = 0.1,
the AP is  1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, . . .
a =  0,
d = 1 1
2 ,
the AP is  0,  1 1
2 , 3, 4 1
2 , 6, . . .
a = 2,
d = 0,
the AP is  2, 2, 2, 2, . . .
So, if you know what a and d are, you can list the AP. What about the other way
round? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then
find a and d? Since a is the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP,
every succeeding term is obtained by adding d to the preceding term. So, d found by
subtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately follows
it should be same for an AP.
For example, for the list of numbers :
6, 9, 12, 15, . . . ,
We have
a2 – a1 = 9  – 6 = 3,
a3 – a2 = 12 – 9 = 3,
a4 – a3 = 15 – 12 = 3
Here the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the
given list is an AP whose first term a is 6 and common difference d is 3.
For the list of numbers : 6, 3, 0, – 3, . . .,
a2 – a1 = 3 – 6 = – 3
a3 – a2 = 0 – 3 = – 3
a4 – a3 = –3 – 0  = –3
Similarly this is also an AP whose first term is 6 and the common difference
is –3.
In general, for an AP a1, a2, . . ., an, we have
d = ak + 1 – ak
where ak + 1  and ak  are the ( k + 1)th and the kth terms respectively.
To obtain d in a given AP, we need not find all of a2 – a1, a3 – a2, a4 – a3, . . . .
It is enough to find only one of them.
Consider the list of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . . By looking at it, you can tell that the
difference between any two consecutive terms is not the same. So, this is not an AP.
Reprint 2025-26
54
MATHEMATICS
Note that to find d in the AP : 6, 3, 0, – 3, . . ., we have subtracted 6 from 3
and not 3 from 6, i.e., we should subtract the kth term from the (k + 1) th term
even if the (k + 1) th term is smaller.
Let us make the concept more clear through some examples.
Example 1 : For the AP : 3

 , . . ., write the first term a and the
common difference d.
Solution : Here,
a = 3
2 , d = 1
2  – 3
2  = – 1.
Remember that we can find d using any two consecutive terms, once we know that
the numbers are in AP.
Example 2 : Which of the following list of numbers form an AP? If they form an AP,
write the next two terms :
(i) 4, 10, 16, 22, . . .
(ii) 1, – 1, – 3, – 5, . . .
(iii) – 2, 2, – 2, 2, – 2, . . .
(iv) 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, . . .
Solution :
(i) We have a2 – a1 = 10 – 4 =   6
a3 – a2 = 16 – 10 =  6
a4 – a3 = 22 – 16  = 6
i.e.,
ak + 1 – ak  is the same every time.
So, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = 6.
The next two terms are: 22 + 6 = 28 and 28 + 6 = 34.
(ii)
a2 – a1 =  – 1 – 1 = – 2
a3 – a2 =  – 3 – ( –1 ) = – 3 + 1 = – 2
 a4 – a3 = – 5 – ( –3 ) = – 5 + 3 = – 2
i.e., ak + 1 – ak  is the same every time.
So, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = – 2.
The next two terms are:
– 5 + (– 2 ) = – 7
and
– 7 + (– 2 ) = – 9
(iii) a2 – a1 = 2 – (– 2) = 2 + 2 = 4
a3 – a2  = – 2 – 2 = – 4
As a2 – a1   a3 – a2 , the given list of numbers does not form an AP.

So, the given list of numbers does not form an AP.

5.3 nth Term of an AP
Let us consider the situation again, given in Section 5.1 in which Reena applied for a
job and got selected. She has been offered the job with a starting monthly salary of
` 8000, with an annual increment of ` 500. What would be her monthly salary for the
fifth year?
To answer this, let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year
would be.
It would be ` (8000 + 500) = ` 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly
salary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding ` 500 to the salary of the previous year.
So, the salary for the 3rd year = ` (8500 + 500)
= ` (8000 + 500 + 500)
= ` (8000 + 2 × 500)
= ` [8000 + (3 – 1) × 500]
(for the 3rd year)
= ` 9000
Salary for the 4th year   = ` (9000 + 500)
= ` (8000 + 500 + 500 + 500)
= ` (8000 + 3 × 500)
= ` [8000 + (4 – 1) × 500]
(for the 4th year)
= ` 9500
Salary for the 5th year    = ` (9500 + 500)
= ` (8000+500+500+500 + 500)
= ` (8000 + 4 × 500)
= ` [8000 + (5 – 1) × 500]
(for the 5th year)
= ` 10000
Observe that we are getting a list of numbers
8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, . . .
These numbers are in AP. (Why?)

Now, looking at the pattern formed above, can you find her monthly salary for
the 6th year? The 15th year? And, assuming that she will still be working in the job,
what about the monthly salary for the 25th year? You would calculate this by adding
` 500 each time to the salary of the previous year to give the answer. Can we make
this process shorter? Let us see. You may have already got some idea from the way
we have obtained the salaries above.
Salary for the 15th year
=  Salary for the 14th year + ` 500
=  
=  ` [8000 + 14 × 500]
=  ` [8000 + (15 – 1) × 500] = ` 15000
i.e.,
First salary + (15 – 1) × Annual increment.
In the same way, her monthly salary for the 25th year would be
` [8000 + (25 – 1) × 500] = ` 20000
= First salary + (25 – 1) × Annual increment
This example would have given you some idea about how to write the 15th term,
or the 25th term, and more generally, the nth term of the AP.
Let a1, a2, a3, . . . be an AP whose first term a1 is a and the common
difference is d.
Then,
the second term a2 = a + d = a + (2 – 1) d
the third term
a3 = a2 + d = (a + d) + d = a + 2d = a + (3 – 1) d
the fourth term
a4 = a3 + d = (a + 2d) + d = a + 3d = a + (4 – 1) d
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
Looking at the pattern, we can say that the nth term an = a + (n – 1) d.
So, the nth term an of the AP with first term a and common difference d is
given by an = a + (n – 1) d.

an is also called the general term of the AP. If there are m terms in the AP, then
am represents the last term which is sometimes also denoted by l.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 3 : Find the 10th term of the AP :  2, 7, 12, . . .
Solution : Here, a = 2,
d = 7 – 2 = 5
and
n =  10.
We have
an = a + (n – 1) d
So,
a10 = 2 + (10 – 1) × 5 = 2 + 45 = 47
Therefore, the 10th term of the given AP is 47.
Example 4 : Which term of the AP : 21, 18, 15, . . . is – 81? Also, is any term 0? Give
reason for your answer.
Solution : Here, a = 21, d = 18 – 21 = – 3 and an = – 81, and we have to find n.
As
an = a + ( n – 1) d,
we have
– 81 = 21 + (n – 1)(– 3)
– 81 = 24 – 3n
– 105 = – 3n
So,
n = 35
Therefore, the 35th term of the given AP is – 81.
Next, we want to know if there is any n for which an = 0. If such an n is there, then
21 + (n – 1) (–3) = 0,
i.e.,
3(n – 1) = 21
i.e.,
n = 8
So, the eighth term is 0.
Example 5 : Determine the AP whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9.
Solution : We have
a3 = a + (3 – 1) d = a + 2d = 5
(1)
and
a7 = a + (7 – 1) d = a + 6d = 9
(2)
Solving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get
a = 3,
d = 1
Hence, the required AP is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . .

Example 6 : Check whether 301 is a term of the list of numbers 5, 11, 17, 23, . . .
Solution : We have :
a2 – a1 = 11 – 5 = 6,
a3 – a2 = 17 – 11 = 6,
a4 – a3 = 23 – 17 = 6
As ak + 1 – ak is the same for k = 1, 2, 3, etc., the given list of numbers is an AP.
Now,
a = 5
and
d = 6.
Let 301 be a term, say, the nth term of this AP.
We know that
an = a + (n – 1) d
So,
301 = 5 + (n – 1) × 6
i.e.,
301 = 6n – 1
So,
n = 302

But n should be a positive integer (Why?). So, 301 is not a term of the given list of
numbers.
Example 7 : How many two-digit numbers are divisible by 3?
Solution : The list of two-digit numbers divisible by 3 is :
12, 15, 18, . . . , 99
Is this an AP? Yes it is. Here,
a = 12, d = 3, an = 99.
As
an = a + (n – 1) d,
we have
99 = 12 + (n – 1) × 3
i.e.,
87 = (n – 1) × 3
i.e.,
n – 1 = 87
3  = 29
i.e.,
n = 29 + 1 = 30
So, there are 30 two-digit numbers divisible by 3.
Example 8 : Find the 11th term from the last term (towards the first term) of the
AP : 10, 7, 4, . . ., – 62.
Solution : Here,
a = 10, d = 7 – 10 = – 3, l = – 62,
where
l =  a + (n – 1) d

MATHEMATICS
To find the 11th term from the last term, we will find the total number of terms in
the AP.
So,
– 62 = 10 + (n – 1)(–3)
i.e.,
– 72 = (n – 1)(–3)
i.e.,
n – 1 = 24
or
n = 25
So, there are 25 terms in the given AP.
The 11th term from the last term will be the 15th term. (Note that it will not be
the 14th term. Why?)
So,
a15 = 10 + (15 – 1)(–3) = 10 – 42 = – 32
i.e., the 11th term from the last term is – 32.
Alternative Solution :
If we write the given AP in the reverse order, then a = – 62 and d = 3 (Why?)
So, the question now becomes finding the 11th term with these a and d.
So,
a11 = – 62 + (11 – 1) × 3 = – 62 + 30 = – 32
So, the 11th term, which is now the required term, is – 32.
Example 9 : A sum of ` 1000 is invested at 8% simple interest per year. Calculate the
interest at the end of each year. Do these interests form an AP? If so, find the interest
at the end of 30 years making use of this fact.
Solution : We know that the formula to calculate simple interest is given by
Simple Interest = P×R×T
100
So, the interest at the end of the 1st year =
1000×8×1
100
`
 =  ` 80
The interest at the end of the 2nd year =
1000×8× 2
100
`
 = ` 160
The interest at the end of the 3rd year =
1000×8×3
100
`
 = ` 240
Similarly, we can obtain the interest at the end of the 4th year, 5th year, and so on.
So, the interest (in `) at the end of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . years, respectively are
80, 160, 240, . . .

It is an AP as the difference between the consecutive terms in the list is 80, i.e.,
d = 80. Also, a = 80.
So, to find the interest at the end of 30 years, we shall find a30.
Now,
a30 = a + (30 – 1) d = 80 + 29 × 80 = 2400
So, the interest at the end of 30 years will be ` 2400.
Example 10 : In a flower bed, there are 23 rose plants in the first row, 21 in the
second, 19 in the third, and so on. There are 5 rose plants in the last row. How many
rows are there in the flower bed?
Solution : The number of rose plants in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., rows are :
23, 21, 19, . . ., 5
It forms an AP (Why?). Let the number of rows in the flower bed be n.
Then
a = 23,
d = 21 – 23 = – 2, an = 5
As,
an = a + (n – 1) d
We have,
5 = 23 + (n – 1)(– 2)
i.e.,
– 18 = (n – 1)(– 2)
i.e.,
n = 10
So, there are 10 rows in the flower bed.

5.4 Sum of First n Terms of an AP
Let us consider the situation again
given in Section 5.1 in which Shakila
put ` 100 into her daughter’s money
box when she was one year old,
` 150 on her second birthday,
` 200 on her third birthday and will
continue in the same way. How much
money will be collected in the money
box by the time her daughter is 21
years old?
Here, the amount of money (in `) put in the money box on her first, second, third,
fourth . . . birthday were respectively 100, 150, 200, 250, . . . till her 21st birthday. To
find the total amount in the money box on her 21st birthday, we will have to write each
of the 21 numbers in the list above and then add them up. Don’t you think it would be
a tedious and time consuming process? Can we make the process shorter? This would
be possible if we can find a method for getting this sum. Let us see.
We consider the problem given to Gauss (about whom you read in
Chapter 1), to solve when he was just 10 years old. He was asked to find the sum of
the positive integers from 1 to 100. He immediately replied that the sum is 5050. Can
you guess how did he do? He wrote :
S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 99 + 100
And then, reversed the numbers to write
S = 100 + 99 + . . . + 3 + 2 + 1
Adding these two, he got
2S = (100 + 1) + (99 + 2) + . . . + (3 + 98) + (2 + 99) + (1 + 100)
= 101 + 101 + . . . + 101 + 101
(100 times)
So,
S = 100

We will now use the same technique to find the sum of the first n terms of an AP :
a, a + d, a + 2d, . . .
The nth term of this AP is a + (n – 1) d. Let S denote the sum of the first n terms
of the AP. We have
S = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + . . . + [a + (n – 1) d]
(1)
Rewriting the terms in reverse order, we have
S = [a + (n – 1) d] + [a + (n – 2) d] + . . . + (a + d) + a

or,

(Since, there are n terms)
or,
S = 2
n  [2a + (n – 1) d]
So, the sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by
S = 2
n  [2a + (n – 1) d]
We can also write this as
S = 2
n  [a + a + (n – 1) d]
i.e.,
S = 2
n  (a + an)
(3)
Now, if there are only n terms in an AP, then an = l, the last term.
From (3), we see that
S = 2
n  (a + l )
(4)
This form of the result is useful when the first and the last terms of an AP are
given and the common difference is not given.
Now we return to the question that was posed to us in the beginning. The amount
of money (in Rs) in the money box of Shakila’s daughter on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th birthday,
. . ., were 100, 150, 200, 250, . . ., respectively.
This is an AP. We have to find the total money collected on her 21st birthday, i.e.,
the sum of the first 21 terms of this AP.

Hasn’t the use of the formula made it much easier to solve the problem?
We also use Sn in place of S to denote the sum of first n terms of the AP. We
write S20 to denote the sum of the first 20 terms of an AP. The formula for the sum of
the first n terms involves four quantities S, a, d and n. If we know any three of them,
we can find the fourth.
Remark : The nth term of an AP is the difference of the sum to first n terms and the
sum to first (n – 1) terms of it, i.e., an = Sn – Sn – 1.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 11 : Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP : 8, 3, –2, . . .

find the 20th term.

Both values of n are admissible. So, the number of terms is either 4 or 13.
Remarks:
1. In this case, the sum of the first 4 terms = the sum of the first 13 terms = 78.
2. Two answers are possible because the sum of the terms from 5th to 13th will be
zero. This is because a is positive and d is negative, so that some terms will be
positive and some others negative, and will cancel out each other.

(i) the production in the 1st year
(ii) the production in the 10th year
(iii) the total production in first 7 years
Solution : (i) Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year,
the number of TV sets manufactured in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., years will form an AP.
Let us denote the number of TV sets manufactured in the nth year by an.
Then,

or,
a + 2d = 600

a = 550.
Therefore, production of TV sets in the first year is 550.
(ii) Now
a10 = a + 9d = 550 + 9 × 25 = 775
So, production of TV sets in the 10th year is 775.

In this chapter, you have studied the following points :
1. An arithmetic progression (AP) is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by
adding a fixed number d to the preceding term, except the first term. The fixed number d
is called the common difference.
The general form of an AP is a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . .
2. A given list of numbers a1, a2, a3, . . . is an AP, if the differences a2 – a1, a3 – a2,
a4 – a3, . . ., give the same value, i.e., if ak + 1 – ak is the same for different values of k.
3. In an AP with first term a and common difference d, the nth term (or the general term) is
given by
 an = a + (n – 1) d.

6.1 Introduction
You are familiar with triangles and many of their properties from your earlier classes.
In Class IX, you have studied congruence of triangles in detail. Recall that two figures
are said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this
chapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily
the same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size)
are called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and
apply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.
Can you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of
some long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have

MATHEMATICS
been measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights
and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is
based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3
and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).
6.2 Similar Figures
In Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all
squares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the
same side lengths are congruent.
Now consider any two (or more)
circles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they
congruent? Since all of them do not
have the same radius, they are not
congruent to each other. Note that
some are congruent and some are not,
but all of them have the same shape.
So they all are, what we call, similar.
Two similar figures have the same
shape but not necessarily the same
size. Therefore, all circles are similar.
What about two (or more) squares or
two (or more) equilateral triangles
[see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed
in the case of circles, here also all
squares are similar and all equilateral
triangles are similar.
From the above, we can say
that all congruent figures are
similar but the similar figures need
not be congruent.
Can a circle and a square be
similar? Can a triangle and a square
be similar? These questions can be
answered by just looking at the
figures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently
these figures are not similar. (Why?)

What can you say about the two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS
(see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These  figures appear to be similar but we cannot be
certain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and
based on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar
or not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:
Fig. 6.3
You will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument
(Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs  are
similar? Yes,they are.
What can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same
person one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these
photographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are
not of the same shape. So, they are not similar.
What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes
from the same negative? You must  have heard about the stamp size, passport size and
postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say
of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we
consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line
segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be 45

 of that of the line segment.
This really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged
(increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55).  It can also be said that every line segment
of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,
if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments
in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)
are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular
of two polygons. We say that:
Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their
corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the
same ratio (or proportion).
Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS
Note that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale
factor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that
world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are
prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.
In order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following
activity:
Activity 1 :  Place a lighted bulb at a
point O on the ceiling  and directly below
it a table in your classroom. Let us cut a
polygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from
a plane cardboard and place this
cardboard parallel to the ground between
the lighted bulb  and the table. Then a
shadow of ABCD is cast on the table.
Mark the outline of this shadow as
ABCD (see Fig.6.4).
Note that the quadrilateral ABCD  is
an enlargement (or magnification) of  the
quadrilateral ABCD. This is because of
the property of light that light propogates
in a straight line. You may also note that
A lies on ray OA, B lies on ray OB, C
lies on  OC and D lies on OD.  Thus, quadrilaterals ABCD  and ABCD are of the
same shape but of different sizes.
So, quadrilateral  ABCD  is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say
that quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral ABCD.
Here, you can also note that vertex A corresponds to vertex A, vertex B
corresponds to vertex B, vertex C corresponds to vertex C and vertex  D corresponds
to vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A A, B B,
C C and D D. By actually measuring the angles and the sides of the two
quadrilaterals, you may verify that
(i)  A =  A,  B =  B,  C =  C,  D =  D and
(ii)  AB

This again emphasises that two polygons of the same number of sides are
similar, if (i) all the corresponding angles are equal and (ii) all the corresponding
sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).

From the above, you can easily say that quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS of
Fig. 6.5 are similar.
Fig. 6.5
Remark : You can verify that if one polygon is similar to another polygon and this
second polygon is similar to a third polygon, then the first polygon is similar to the third
polygon.
You may note that in the two quadrilaterals (a square and a rectangle) of
Fig. 6.6, corresponding angles are equal, but their corresponding sides are not in the
same ratio.
Fig. 6.6
So, the two quadrilaterals are not similar. Similarly, you may note that in the two
quadrilaterals (a square and a rhombus) of Fig. 6.7, corresponding sides are in the
same ratio, but their corresponding angles are not equal. Again, the two polygons
(quadrilaterals) are not similar.

6.3 Similarity of Triangles
What can you say about the similarity of two triangles?
You may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions
for the similarity of two triangles. That is:
Two triangles are similiar, if
(i) their corresponding angles are equal and
(ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).
Note that if corresponding angles of two
triangles are equal, then they are known as
equiangular triangles. A famous Greek
mathematician Thales gave an important truth relating
to two equiangular triangles which is as follows:
The ratio of any two corresponding sides in
two equiangular triangles is always the same.
It is believed that he had used a result called
the Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as
the Thales Theorem) for the same.
To understand the Basic Proportionality
Theorem, let us perform the following activity:
Activity 2 : Draw any angle XAY and on its one
arm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, R and
B such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB.
Now, through B, draw any line intersecting arm
AY at C (see Fig. 6.9).
Also, through the point D, draw a line parallel
to BC to intersect AC at E. Do you observe from
your constructions that AD

EC. What about AE
EC ? Observe that AE

theorem (known as the Basic Proportionality Theorem):

Theorem 6.1 : If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the
other two sides in distinct points, the other two sides are divided in the same

AC at D and E respectively (see Fig. 6.10).

Similarly,
ar(BDE) = 1

ar(ADE) = 1

Is the converse of this theorem also true (For the meaning of converse, see
Appendix 1)? To examine this, let us perform the following activity:
Activity 3 :  Draw an angle XAY on your
notebook and on ray AX, mark points B1, B2,
B3, B4 and B such that AB1 = B1B2 = B2B3 =
B3B4 = B4B.
Similarly, on ray AY, mark points
C1, C2, C3, C4 and C such that AC1 = C1C2 =
C2C3 = C3C4 = C4C. Then join B1C1 and BC

From (1), (2), (3) and (4), it can be observed that if a line divides two sides of a
triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.
You can repeat this activity by drawing any angle XAY of different measure and
taking any  number of equal parts on arms AX and AY . Each time, you will arrive at
the same result. Thus, we obtain the following theorem, which is the converse of
Theorem 6.1:

6.4 Criteria for Similarity of Triangles

angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).

MATHEMATICS
Here, you can see that A corresponds to D, B corresponds to E and C
corresponds to F. Symbolically, we write the similarity of these two triangles as
‘ ABC ~  DEF’ and read it as ‘triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF’. The
symbol ‘~’ stands for ‘is similar to’. Recall that you have used the symbol ‘’ for
‘is congruent to’ in Class IX.
It must be noted that as done in the case of congruency of two triangles, the
similarity of two triangles should also be expressed symbolically, using correct
correspondence of their vertices. For example, for the triangles ABC and DEF of
Fig. 6.22, we cannot write  ABC ~  EDF or  ABC ~  FED. However, we
can write  BAC ~  EDF.
Now a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say
ABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding
angles ( A =  D,  B =  E,  C =  F) and all the equality relations of the ratios
of their corresponding sides

only three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also,
let us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involving
relationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles,
instead of all the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the following
activity:
Activity 4 : Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm
and 5 cm respectively. Then, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC
and QCB of some measures, say, 60° and 40°. Also, at the points E and F, construct
angles REF and SFE of 60° and 40° respectively (see Fig. 6.23).

other at D. In the two triangles ABC and DEF, you can see that

triangles are equal. What can you say about their corresponding sides ? Note that

constructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every

This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles.
Theorem 6.3 : If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their
corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two
triangles are similar.
This criterion is referred to as the AAA
(Angle–Angle–Angle) criterion of
similarity of two triangles.

triangles ABC and DEF such that

Remark : If two angles of a triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another
triangle, then by the angle sum property of a triangle their third angles will also be
equal. Therefore, AAA similarity criterion can also be stated as follows:

If two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another
triangle, then the two triangles are similar.
This may be referred to as the AA similarity criterion for two triangles.
You have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively
equal to the three angles of another triangle, then their corresponding sides are
proportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the
converse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to
the sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us
examine it through an activity :
Activity 5 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm,
CA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD = 12 cm (see Fig. 6.25).

So, you have :

(each equal to 2

Now measure  A,  B,  C,  D,  E and  F. You will observe that
 A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F, i.e., the corresponding angles of the two
triangles are equal.
You can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides
in the same ratio). Everytime  you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal.
It is due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles:
Theorem 6.4 : If in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to
(i.e., in the same ratio of ) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding
angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar.
This criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side–Side–Side) similarity criterion for
two triangles.
This theorem can be proved by taking two triangles ABC and DEF such that

Remark : You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (i) corresponding
angles are equal and (ii) corresponding sides are in the same ratio is not sufficient for
two polygons to be similar. However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can
now say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both
the conditions as one condition implies the other.
Let us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in
Class IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS
congruency criterion.This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to
SAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity.
Activity 6 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 2 cm,  A = 50°,
AC = 4 cm, DE = 3 cm,  D = 50° and DF = 6 cm (see Fig.6.27).

Here, you may observe that AB
DE  = AC
DF  (each equal to 2

between the sides AB and AC) =  D (included between the sides DE and DF). That
is, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including
these angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure  B,  C,
 E and  F.
You will find that  B =  E and  C =  F. That is,  A =  D,  B =  E and
 C =  F. So, by AAA similarity criterion,  ABC ~  DEF. You may repeat this
activity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal to
one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional.
Everytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterion
of similarity of triangles:
Theorem 6.5 : If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other
triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two
triangles are similar.
This criterion is referred to as
the SAS (Side–Angle–Side)
similarity criterion for two
triangles.
As before, this theorem can

2. All the congruent figures are similar but the converse is not true.
3. Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles
are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion).
4. If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in
distinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.
5. If a line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the
third side.
6. If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in
the same ratio and hence the two triangles are similar (AAA similarity criterion).
7. If in two triangles, two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the two angles of
the other triangle, then the two triangles are similar (AA similarity criterion).

proportional to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle,
then the two triangles are similar. This may be referred to as the

7.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you have studied that to locate the position of a point on a plane, we
require a pair of coordinate axes. The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its
x-coordinate, or abscissa. The distance of a point from the x-axis is called its
y-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form
(x, 0), and of a point on the y-axis are of the form (0, y).
Here is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph
paper. Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to
B(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to D(1, 6) to E(1, 5) to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to
J(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and R(4, 6) to
form a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and Z(6, 6) to form a triangle.
Now join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points
(0, 5) and (0, 6) and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got?
Also, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form
ax + by + c = 0, (a, b are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically,
gives a straight line. Further, in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of
y = ax2 + bx + c (a ¹ 0), is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed
as an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry
using algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry. Because of this,
coordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering,
navigation, seismology and art!
In this chapter, you will learn how to find the distance between the two points
whose coordinates are given. You will also study how to find the coordinates of the
point which divides a line segment joining two given points in a given ratio.

7.2 Distance Formula
Let us consider the following situation:
A town B is located 36 km east and 15
km north of the town A. How would you find
the distance from town A to town B without
actually measuring it. Let us see. This situation
can be represented graphically as shown in
Fig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem
to calculate this distance.
Now, suppose two points lie on the x-axis.
Can we find the distance between them? For
instance, consider two points A(4, 0) and B(6, 0)
in Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the x-axis.
From the figure you can see that OA = 4
units and OB = 6 units.
Therefore, the distance of B from A, i.e.,
AB = OB – OA = 6 – 4 = 2 units.
So, if two points lie on the x-axis, we can
easily find the distance between them.
Now, suppose we take two points lying on
the y-axis. Can you find the distance between
them. If the points C(0, 3) and D(0, 8) lie on the
y-axis, similarly we find that CD = 8 – 3 = 5 units
(see Fig. 7.2).
Next, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)? Since OA = 4 units and
OC = 3 units, the distance of A from C, i.e., AC = 
2
2
3
4

 = 5 units. Similarly, you can
find the distance of B from D = BD = 10 units.
Now, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the
distance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see
an example.
In Fig. 7.3, the points P(4, 6) and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use
Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QS
perpendicular to the x-axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular
from P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0),
respectively.  So, RS = 2 units. Also, QS = 8 units and TS = PR = 6 units.
Fig. 7.1
Fig. 7.2
Reprint 2025-26

Therefore, QT = 2 units and PT = RS = 2 units.
Now, using the Pythagoras theorem, we
have
 PQ2 = PT2 + QT2
= 22 + 22 = 8
So,
PQ = 2 2  units
How will we find the distance between two
points in two different quadrants?
Consider the points P(6, 4) and Q(–5, –3)
(see Fig. 7.4). Draw QS perpendicular to the
x-axis. Also draw a perpendicular PT from the
point P on QS (extended) to meet y-axis at the
point R.
Fig. 7.4
Then PT = 11 units and QT = 7 units. (Why?)
Using the Pythagoras Theorem to the right triangle PTQ, we get
PQ =

Let us now find the distance between any two
points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2). Draw PR and QS
perpendicular to the x-axis. A perpendicular from the
point P on QS is drawn to meet it at the point
T (see Fig. 7.5).
Then,
OR = x1, OS = x2.
So, RS = x2 – x1 = PT.
Also,
SQ = y2, ST = PR = y1.
So, QT = y2 – y1.
Now, applying the Pythagoras theorem in  PTQ, we get
PQ2 = PT2 + QT2
= (x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2

PQ =

Therefore, PQR is a right triangle.

Since, AB = BC = CD = DA and AC = BD, all the four sides of the quadrilateral
ABCD are equal and its diagonals AC and BD are also equal. Thereore, ABCD is a
square.
Alternative Solution : We find
the four sides and one diagonal, say,
AC as above. Here AD2 + DC2 =
34 + 34 = 68 = AC2. Therefore, by
the converse of Pythagoras
theorem,  D = 90°. A quadrilateral
with all four sides equal and one
angle 90° is a square. So, ABCD
is a square.

 we can say that the points A, B and C
are collinear. Therefore, they are seated in a line.
Example 4 : Find a relation between x and y such that the point (x , y) is equidistant
from the points (7, 1) and (3, 5).
Solution : Let P(x, y) be equidistant from the points A(7, 1) and B(3, 5).
We are given that AP = BP. So, AP2 = BP2
i.e.,
(x – 7)2 + (y – 1)2 = (x – 3)2 + (y – 5)2
i.e.,
x2 – 14x + 49 + y2 – 2y + 1 = x2 – 6x + 9 + y2 – 10y + 25
i.e.,
x – y = 2
which is the required relation.
Remark : Note that the graph of the equation
x – y = 2 is a line. From your earlier studies,
you know that a point which is equidistant
from A and B lies on the perpendicular
bisector of AB. Therefore, the graph of
x – y = 2 is the perpendicular bisector of AB
(see Fig. 7.7).
Example 5 : Find a point on the y-axis which
is equidistant from the points A(6, 5) and
B(– 4, 3).
Solution : We know that a point on the
y-axis is of the form (0, y). So, let the point
P(0, y) be equidistant from A and B. Then
(6 – 0)2 + (5 – y)2 = (– 4 – 0)2 + (3 – y)2
i.e.,
36 + 25 + y2 – 10y = 16 + 9 + y2 – 6y
i.e.,
 4y = 36
i.e.,
y = 9

7.3 Section Formula
Let us recall the situation in Section 7.2.
Suppose a telephone company wants to
position a relay tower at P between A and B
is such a way that the distance of the tower
from B is twice its distance from A. If P lies
on AB, it will divide AB in the ratio 1 : 2
(see Fig. 7.9). If we take A as the origin O,
and 1 km as one unit on both the axis, the
coordinates of B will be (36, 15). In order to
know the position of the tower, we must know
the coordinates of P. How do we find these
coordinates?
Let the coordinates of P be (x, y). Draw perpendiculars from P and B to the
x-axis, meeting it in D and E, respectively. Draw PC perpendicular to BE. Then, by
the AA similarity criterion, studied in Chapter 6,  POD and  BPC are similar.

You can check that P(12, 5) meets the
condition that OP : PB = 1 : 2.
Now let us use the understanding that
you may have developed through this
example to obtain the general formula.
Consider any two points A(x1, y1) and

So, the point (– 4, 6) divides the line segment joining the points A(– 6, 10) and

Note : You can also find this ratio by calculating the distances PA and PB and taking

Therefore, the coordinates of the points of trisection of the line segment joining A and

Note that, here, PA : PB = m1 : m2.
However, if P does not lie between A and B but lies on the line AB,
outside the line segment AB, and PA : PB = m1 : m2, we say that P divides
externally the line segment joining the points A and B. You will study
Section Formula for such case in higher classes.

1.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you began your exploration of the world of real numbers and encountered
irrational numbers. We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We
begin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the
Euclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
Euclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of
integers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive
integer b in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you
probably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite
easy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties
of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of
two positive integers.
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something
with multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number
can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way—this important fact is the
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and
understand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics.
We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we
use it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as
2,
3  and 5 . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal
expansion of a rational number, say 
(
0)
p q
q

, is terminating and when it is non-
terminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator
q of p
q . You will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the nature
of the decimal expansion of p
q .
So let us begin our exploration.

MATHEMATICS
1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
In your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a
product of its prime factors. For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 11 × 23, and so on.
Now, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any
natural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.
Take any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply
some or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,
we can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).
Let us list a few :
7 × 11 × 23 = 1771
3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 5313
2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 10626
23 × 3 × 73 = 8232
22 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 21252
and so on.
Now, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.
What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite
number of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,
if we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite
collection of numbers, all
the primes and all possible
products of primes. The
question is – can we
produce all the composite
numbers this way? What
do you think? Do you
think that there may be a
composite number which
is not the product of
powers 
of 
primes?
Before we answer this,
let us factorise positive
integers, that is, do the
opposite of what we have
done so far.
We are going to use
the factor tree with which
you are all familiar. Let us
take some large number,
say, 32760, and factorise
it as shown.

Carl Friedrich Gauss
(1777 – 1855)
An equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably
first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s
Elements, before it came to be known as the
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the
first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss
in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.
Carl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince
of Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three
greatest mathematicians of all time, along with
Archimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental
contributions to both mathematics and science.
So we have factorised 32760 as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of
primes, i.e., 32760 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try
another number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 32 × 3803 × 3607. Of course,
you have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural
numbers yourself.)   This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be
written as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called
the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance
to the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.
Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite
number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation
is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can
be factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any
composite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’
way, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite
number there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we
are not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we
regard 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 as the same as 3 × 5 × 7 × 2, or any other possible order in which
these primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form:
The prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order
of its factors.

MATHEMATICS
In general, given a composite number x, we factorise it as x = p1p2 ... pn, where
p1, p2,..., pn are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., p1  p2
 . . .  pn. If we combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example,
32760 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13
Once we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number
is factorised, is unique.
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within
mathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples.
Example 1 : Consider the numbers 4n, where n is a natural number. Check whether
there is any value of n for which 4n ends with the digit zero.
Solution : If the number 4n, for any n, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be
divisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4n would contain the prime 5. This is
not possible because 4n = (2)2n; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4n is 2. So, the
uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no
other primes in the factorisation of 4n. So, there is no natural number n for which 4n
ends with the digit zero.
You have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers
using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it!
This method is also called the prime factorisation method. Let us recall this method
through an example.
Example 2 : Find the LCM and HCF  of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method.
Solution : We have :
6 = 21 × 31 and 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 = 22 × 51.
You can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60, as done in your
earlier classes.
Note that HCF(6, 20) = 21 = Product of the smallest power of each common
prime factor in the numbers.
LCM (6, 20) = 22 × 31 × 51 = Product of the greatest power of each prime factor,
involved in the numbers.
From the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) × LCM(6, 20)
= 6 × 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers a and b,
HCF (a, b) × LCM (a, b) = a × b. We can use this result to find the LCM of two
positive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers.
Example 3: Find the HCF of 96 and 404 by the prime factorisation method. Hence,

Solution : The prime factorisation of 96 and 404 gives :

Here, 21 and 31 are the smallest powers of the common factors 2 and 3, respectively.
So,
HCF (6, 72, 120) = 21 × 31 = 2 × 3 = 6
23, 32 and 51 are the greatest powers of the prime factors 2, 3 and 5 respectively
involved in the three numbers.
So,
LCM (6, 72, 120) = 23 × 32 × 51 = 360
Remark : Notice, 6 × 72 × 120  HCF (6, 72, 120) × LCM (6, 72, 120). So, the
product of three numbers is not equal to the product of their HCF and LCM.

1.3 Revisiting Irrational Numbers
In Class IX, you were introduced to irrational numbers and many of their properties.
You studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together
made up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number
line. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will
prove that 
2 ,
3 ,
5  and, in general, 
p  is irrational, where p is a prime. One of
the theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
Recall, a number ‘s’ is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form 
,
p
q
where p and q are integers and q ¹ 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with
which you are already familiar, are :
2 ,

, etc.
Before we prove that 
2  is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose
proof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
Theorem 1.2 : Let p be a prime number. If p divides a2, then p divides a, where
a is a positive integer.
*Proof : Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows :
a = p1p2 . . . pn, where p1,p2, . . ., pn are primes, not necessarily distinct.
Therefore, a2 = (p1p2 . . . pn)( p1p2 . . . pn) = p2
1p2
2 . . . p2
n.
Now, we are given that p divides a2. Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a2. However, using the
uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only
prime factors of a2 are p1, p2, . . ., pn. So p is one of p1, p2, . . ., pn.
Now, since a = p1 p2 . . . pn, p divides a.
We are now ready to give a proof that 
2  is irrational.
The proof is based on a technique called ‘proof by contradiction’. (This technique is
discussed in some detail in Appendix 1).
Theorem 1.3 : 
2  is irrational.
Proof : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 
2  is rational.

So, we can find integers r and s (¹ 0) such that 
2  = r
s .
Suppose r and s have a common factor other than 1. Then, we divide by the common
factor to get

 where a and b are coprime.
So, b
2  = a.
Squaring on both sides and rearranging, we get 2b2 = a2. Therefore, 2 divides a2.
Now, by Theorem 1.2, it follows that 2 divides a.
So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c.
Substituting for a, we get 2b2 = 4c2, that is, b2 = 2c2.
This means that 2 divides b2, and so 2 divides b (again using Theorem 1.2 with p = 2).
Therefore, a and b have at least 2 as a common factor.
But this contradicts the fact that a and b have no common factors other than 1.
This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 2  is rational.
So, we conclude that 
2  is irrational.
Example 5 : Prove that 
3  is irrational.
Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 
3  is rational.
That is, we can find integers a and b (¹ 0) such that 
3  = a
b 
Suppose a and b have a common factor other than 1, then we can divide by the
common factor, and assume that a and b are coprime.
So,


Squaring on both sides, and rearranging, we get 3b2 = a2.
Therefore, a2 is divisible by 3, and by Theorem 1.2, it follows that a is also divisible
by 3.
So, we can write a = 3c for some integer c.
Substituting for a, we get 3b2 = 9c2, that is, b2 = 3c2.
This means that b2 is divisible by 3, and so b is also divisible by 3 (using Theorem 1.2
with p = 3).

Therefore, a and b have at least 3 as a common factor.
But this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime.
This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 3  is rational.
So, we conclude that 3  is irrational.
In Class IX, we mentioned that :
the sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational and
the product and quotient of a non-zero rational and irrational number is
irrational.
We prove some particular cases here.
Example 6 : Show that 5 –
3  is irrational.

3  is rational.

In Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall
that if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of
the polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of
degree 1, 2y2 – 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x3 – 4x2 + x –

 are some examples of
quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any
quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers
and a  0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of

 3 – x2 + x3, 3x3 – 2x2 + x – 1. In fact, the most
general form of a cubic polynomial is
ax3 + bx2 + cx + d,
where, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a  0.
Now consider the polynomial p(x) = x2 – 3x – 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the
polynomial, we get p(2) = 22 – 3 × 2 – 4 = – 6. The value ‘– 6’, obtained by replacing
x by 2 in x2 – 3x – 4, is the value of x2 – 3x – 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of
p(x) at x = 0, which is – 4.
If p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by
replacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k).
What is the value of p(x) = x2 –3x – 4 at x = –1? We have :
p(–1) = (–1)2 –{3 × (–1)} – 4 = 0
Also, note that
p(4) = 42 – (3  4) – 4 = 0.
As p(–1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, –1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic
polynomial x2 – 3x – 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a
polynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0.
You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear
polynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us
2k + 3 = 0, i.e., k =

In general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak + b = 0, i.e.,

Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this
happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic
polynomial also related to its coefficients?
In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the
division algorithm for polynomials.
2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial
You know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why
are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the
geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical
meaning of their zeroes.

Consider first a linear polynomial ax + b, a  0. You have studied in Class IX that the
graph of y = ax + b is a straight line. For example, the graph of y = 2x + 3 is a straight
line passing through the points (– 2, –1) and (2, 7).

. Thus, the zero of
the polynomial 2x + 3 is the
x-coordinate of the point where the
graph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the
x-axis.
In general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, the graph of y = ax + b is a
straight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely,

Therefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, has exactly one zero, namely, the
x-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis.
Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial.
Consider the quadratic polynomial x2 – 3x – 4. Let us see what the graph* of
y = x2 – 3x – 4 looks like. Let us list  a few values of y = x2 – 3x – 4 corresponding to
a few values for x as given in Table 2.1.

If we locate the points listed
above on a graph paper and draw
the graph, it will actually look like
the one given in Fig. 2.2.
In fact, for any quadratic
polynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the
graph of the corresponding
equation y = ax2 + bx + c has one
of the two shapes either open
upwards like 
 or open
downwards like 
 depending on
whether a > 0 or a < 0. (These
curves are called parabolas.)
You can see from Table 2.1
that –1 and 4 are zeroes of the
quadratic polynomial. Also
note from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4
are the x-coordinates of the points
where the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4
intersects the x-axis. Thus, the
zeroes of the quadratic polynomial
x2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of
the points where the graph of
y = x2 – 3x – 4 intersects the
x-axis.
This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic
polynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the
parabola representing  y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.
From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the
following three cases can happen:
Fig. 2.2
Reprint 2025-26
14
MATHEMATICS
Case (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A.
The x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial
ax2 + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).
Fig. 2.3
Case (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident
points. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A
(see Fig. 2.4).
Fig. 2.4
The x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c
in this case.
Reprint 2025-26
POLYNOMIALS
15
Case (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below
the x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).
Fig. 2.5
So, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero in this case.
So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two
distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a
polynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.
Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic
polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. To see what
the graph of y = x3 – 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few
values for x as shown in Table 2.2.

MATHEMATICS
We see from the table above
that – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the
cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. Observe
that – 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the
x-coordinates of the only points
where the graph of y = x3 – 4x
intersects the x-axis. Since the curve
meets the x-axis in only these 3
points, their x-coordinates are the
only zeroes of the polynomial.
Let us take a few more
examples. Consider the cubic
polynomials x3 and x3 – x2. We draw
the graphs of y = x3 and y = x3 – x2
in Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.

Reprint 2025-26
POLYNOMIALS
17
Note that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x3. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see
that 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the
x-axis. Similarly, since x3 – x2 = x2 (x – 1),  0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial
x3 – x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points
where the graph of y = x3 – x2 intersects the x-axis.
From the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic
polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.
Remark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)
intersects the x-axis at atmost n points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has
at most n zeroes.
Example 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x),
where p(x) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of p(x).
Fig. 2.9
Solution :
(i) The number of zeroes is 1 as the graph intersects the x-axis at one point only.
(ii) The number of zeroes is 2 as the graph intersects the x-axis at two points.
(iii) The number of zeroes is 3. (Why?)

2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial
You have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial ax + b is 
b
a

. We will now try
to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes
and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,
say p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic
polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term
‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write
2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)
= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)

So, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when
x = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2x2 – 8x + 6 are 1 and 3. Observe that :

Let us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3x2 + 5x – 2. By the
method of splitting the middle term,
3x2 + 5x – 2 = 3x2 + 6x – x – 2 = 3x(x + 2) –1(x + 2)
= (3x – 1)(x + 2)
Hence, the value of 3x2 + 5x – 2 is zero when either 3x – 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,
when x = 1
3  or x = –2. So, the zeroes of 3x2 + 5x – 2 are 1
3  and – 2. Observe that :

In general, if * and * are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial p(x) = ax2 + bx + c,
a  0, then you know that x –  and x –  are the factors of p(x). Therefore,
ax2 + bx + c = k(x – ) (x – ), where k is a constant
= k[x2 – ( + )x + ]
= kx2 – k( + )x + k 
Comparing the coefficients of x2, x and constant terms on both the sides, we get
a = k, b = – k( + ) and c = k

Solution : We have
x2 + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)
So, the value of x2 + 7x + 10 is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x + 5 = 0, i.e., when x = – 2 or
x = –5. Therefore, the zeroes of x2 + 7x + 10 are – 2 and – 5. Now,

Example 4 : Find a quadratic polynomial, the sum and product of whose zeroes are
– 3 and 2, respectively.
Solution : Let the quadratic polynomial be ax2 + bx + c, and its zeroes be  and .
We have
 +  = – 3 = b
a
,
and
 = 2 = c
a
.
If a = 1, then b = 3 and c = 2.
So, one quadratic polynomial which fits the given conditions is x2 + 3x + 2.
You can check that any other quadratic polynomial that fits these conditions will
be of the form k(x2 + 3x + 2), where k is real.
Let us now look at cubic polynomials. Do you think a similar relation holds
between the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients?
Let us consider p(x) = 2x3 – 5x2 – 14x + 8.
You can check that p(x) = 0 for x = 4, – 2, 1
2  Since p(x) can have atmost three
zeroes, these are the zeores of 2x3 – 5x2 – 14x + 8. Now,

3.1 Introduction
You must have come across situations like the one given below :
Akhila went to a fair in her village. She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel
and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if
the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played
Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs
` 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ` 4, how would you find out the number of rides she
had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ` 20.
May be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it
possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge
of Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.

Let us try this approach.
Denote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she
played Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:
y = 1
2 x
(1)
3x + 4y = 20
(2)
Can we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of
finding these, which we will study in this chapter.
3.2 Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations
A pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear
equations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a
consistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has
infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of
linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is
always consistent.
We can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations
in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:
(i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations
has a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).
(ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution
(inconsistent pair of equations).
(iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many
solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].
Consider the following three pairs of equations.
(i) x – 2y = 0 and 3x + 4y – 20 = 0
(The lines intersect)
(ii) 2x + 3y – 9 = 0 and 4x + 6y – 18 = 0
(The lines coincide)
(iii) x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0
(The lines are parallel)

In fact, the converse is also true for any pair of lines. You can verify them by
considering some more examples by yourself.

x + 3y = 6

2x – 3y = 12

solutions of each of the equations, which are given in Table 3.2

P(0, – 4) and Q(3, – 2) on graph
paper, and join the points to form the
lines AB and PQ as shown in
Fig. 3.1.
We observe that there is a point
B (6, 0) common to both the lines
AB and PQ. So, the solution of the
pair of linear equations is x = 6 and
y = 0, i.e., the given pair of equations
is consistent.
Example 2 : Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution,
unique solution or infinitely many solutions:
5x – 8y + 1 = 0
(1)
3x – 24
5 y  + 3
5  = 0
(2)
Solution : Multiplying Equation (2) by 5 ,
3  we get
5x – 8y + 1 = 0
But,  this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1)
and (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.
Plot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.
Example 3 : Champa went to a ‘Sale’ to purchase some pants and skirts. When her
friends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, “The number of
skirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts
is four less than four times the number of pants purchased”. Help her friends to find
how many pants and skirts Champa bought.

Solution : Let us denote the number of pants by x and the number of skirts by y. Then
the equations formed are :

y = 4x – 4

Let us draw the graphs of

as shown in Fig. 3.2.
The two lines intersect at the point (1, 0). So, x = 1, y = 0 is the required solution
of the pair of linear equations, i.e., the number of pants she purchased is 1 and she did
not buy any skirt.
Verify the answer by checking whether it satisfies the conditions of the given
problem.

3.3 Algebraic Methods of Solving a Pair of Linear Equations
In the previous section, we discussed how to solve a pair of linear equations graphically.
The graphical method is not convenient in cases when the point representing the
solution of the linear equations has non-integral coordinates like (

such coordinates. Is there any alternative method of finding the solution? There are
several algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss.

some examples.

Verification : Substituting x = 49
29  and y = 19
29 , you can verify that both the Equations
(1) and (2) are satisfied.
To understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise:
Step 1 : Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from
either equation, whichever is convenient.
Step 2 : Substitute this value of y in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in
one variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and
10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can
conclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement
is false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.
Step 3 : Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in
Step 1 to obtain the value of the other variable.
Remark : We have substituted the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of
the other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is
known as the substitution method.
Example 5 : Solve the following question—Aftab tells his daughter, “Seven years
ago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be
three times as old as you will be.” (Isn’t this interesting?) Represent this situation
algebraically and graphically by the method of substitution.
Solution : Let s and t be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively.
Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is
s – 7 = 7 (t – 7), i.e., s – 7t + 42 = 0
(1)
and
s + 3 = 3 (t + 3), i.e., s – 3t = 6
(2)
Using Equation (2), we get s = 3t + 6.
Putting this value of s in Equation (1), we get
(3t + 6) – 7t + 42 = 0,
i.e.,
4t = 48, which gives t = 12.
Putting this value of t in Equation (2), we get
s = 3 (12) + 6 = 42

So, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively.

Example 6 :  In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is `9 and the cost of 4

This statement is true for all values of y. However, we do not get a specific
value of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This
situation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore,
Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique
cost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the
given situation.

2x + 4y – 12 = 0

We express x in terms of y from Equation (1) to get

3.3.2 Elimination Method
Now let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This
is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method
works.
Example 8 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their
expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their
monthly incomes.
Solution : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9x and ` 7x and their
expenditures by ` 4y and ` 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation
is given by :
9x – 4y = 2000
(1)
and
7x – 3y = 2000
(2)
Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of
y equal. Then we get the equations:
27x – 12y = 6000
(3)
28x – 12y = 8000
(4)
Step 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients
of y are the same. So, we get
(28x – 27x) – (12y – 12y) = 8000 – 6000
i.e.,
x = 2000
Step 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get
9(2000) – 4y = 2000
i.e.,
y = 4000
So, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes
of the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively.
Verification : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures =
18000 – 2000 : 14000 – 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3
Remarks :
1. The method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method,
because we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable.
Reprint 2025-26
PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
35
In the example above, we eliminated y. We could also have eliminated x. Try
doing it that way.
2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this
problem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient.
Let us now note down these steps in the elimination method :
Step 1 : First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make
the coefficients of one variable (either x or y) numerically equal.
Step 2 : Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets
eliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3.
If in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original
pair of equations has infinitely many solutions.
If in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original
pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.
Step 3 : Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) so obtained to get its value.
Step 4 : Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the
value of the other variable.
Now to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples.
Example 9 : Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair
of linear equations :
2x + 3y = 8
(1)
4x + 6y = 7
(2)
Solution :
Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the
coefficients of x equal. Then we get the equations as :
4x + 6y = 16
(3)
4x + 6y = 7
(4)
Step 2 : Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3),
(4x – 4x) + (6y – 6y) = 16 – 7
i.e.,
0 = 9, which is a false statement.
Therefore, the pair of equations has no solution.
Example 10 : The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing
the digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such
numbers are there?
Reprint 2025-26
36
MATHEMATICS
Solution : Let the ten’s and the unit’s digits in the first number be x and y, respectively.
So, the first number may be written as 10 x + y  in the expanded form (for example,
56 = 10(5) + 6).
When the digits are reversed, x becomes the unit’s digit and y becomes the ten’s
digit. This number, in the expanded notation is 10y + x (for example, when 56 is
reversed, we get 65 = 10(6) + 5).
According to the given condition.
(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 66
i.e.,
11(x + y) = 66
i.e.,
x + y = 6
(1)
We are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore,
either
x – y = 2
(2)
or
y – x = 2
(3)
If x – y = 2, then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get x = 4 and y = 2.
In this case, we get the number 42.
If y – x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we get x = 2 and y = 4.
 In this case, we get the number 24.
Thus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24.
Verification : Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2.

2. Graphical Method :
The graph of a pair of linear equations in two variables is represented by two lines.

the line being a solution. In this case, the pair of equations is dependent
(consistent).

e have seen that reproductive processes give rise to new individuals
that are similar, but subtly different. We have discussed how some
amount of variation is produced even during asexual reproduction. And
the number of successful variations are maximised by the process of
sexual reproduction. If we observe a field of sugarcane we find very little
variations among the individual plants. But in a number of animals
including human beings, which reproduce sexually, quite distinct
variations are visible among different individuals. In this chapter, we
shall be studying the mechanism by which variations are created and
inherited.

Inheritance from the previous generation provides
both a common basic body design, and subtle
changes in it, for the next generation. Now think
about what would happen when this new generation,
in its turn, reproduces. The second generation will
have differences that they inherit from the first
generation, as well as newly created differences
(Fig. 8.1).
Figure 8.1 would represent the situation if a
single individual reproduces, as happens in asexual
reproduction. If one bacterium divides, and then the
resultant two bacteria divide again, the four
individual bacteria generated would be very similar.
There would be only very minor differences between
them, generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA
copying. However, if sexual reproduction is involved,
even greater diversity will be generated, as we will
see when we discuss the rules of inheritance.
Do all these variations in a species have equal
chances of surviving in the environment in which they
find themselves? Obviously not. Depending on the
nature of variations, different individuals would have

The most obvious outcome of the reproductive process still remains the
generation of individuals of similar design. The rules of heredity determine
the process by which traits and characteristics are reliably inherited. Let
us take a closer look at these rules.

8.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of Traits –––––
Mendel’s Contributions
The rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to
the fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal
amounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can
be influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait
there will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in
the child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such
inheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from
more than a century ago.

Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden
peas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and
so on.  He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and
a short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the
percentages of tall or short progeny.
In the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-
generation, or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were
tall. This meant that only one of the parental traits
was seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next
question was, were the tall plants in the F1
generation exactly the same as the tall plants of the
parent generation? Mendelian experiments test this
by getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall
plants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny
of the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,
the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall
plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them
are short. This indicates that both the tallness and
shortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but
only the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel
to propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)
controlling traits are present in sexually reproducing
organism. These two may be identical, or may be
different, depending on the parentage. A pattern of
inheritance can be worked out with this assumption,
as shown in Fig. 8.3.
Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884)
Mendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and
mathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a
teaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went
back to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied
the inheritance of traits in peas and other organisms earlier, but Mendel
blended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one
to keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation.
This helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.

In Fig. 8.3, what experiment would we do to confirm that the F2
generation did in fact have a 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt and tt trait
combinations?
In this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a
short plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the
plant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits
like ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are
called recessive traits. Work out which trait would be considered
dominant and which one recessive in Fig. 8.4.

Independent inheritance
of two separate traits,
shape and colour of seeds
What happens when pea plants showing two different
characteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other?
What do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short
plant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have
round seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.
But what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate
F2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find
that some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some
were short plants with wrinkled seeds.  However, there would also
be some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them
would be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short,
but have round seeds. You can see as to how new combinations of
traits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed
shape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form
F2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round
seed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited.
8.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed?
How does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is
the information source for making proteins in the cell. A section
of DNA that provides information for one protein is called the
gene for that protein. How do proteins control the
characteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the
example of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants
have hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus
depend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The
amount of the plant hormone made will depend on the
efficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme
that is important for this process. If this enzyme works
efficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be
tall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes
the enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,
and the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,
or traits.
If the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been
discussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing
equally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction.
We have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter. If both
parents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents
must be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that
each pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from
each parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must
have only one gene set.
How do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two
copies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a
single whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained
in Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and
‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently

inherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not
as a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,
each called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each
chromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-
cell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either
maternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will
restore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring
the stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance
explains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all
sexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms
also follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their
inheritance might work?
8.2.4 Sex Determination
We have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual
reproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number
of reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual
determined? Different species use very different strategies
for this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,
in some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at
which fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the
animals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In
other animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,
indicating that sex is not genetically determined. However,
in human beings, the sex of the individual is largely
genetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited
from our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.
But so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are
inherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can
genetic inheritance determine sex?
The explanation lies in the fact that all human
chromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes
have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22
such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is
odd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a
perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men
have a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X
while the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,
while men are XY. Now, can we work out what the
inheritance pattern of X and Y will be?
As Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and
half will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome
from their mother regardless of whether they are boys or
girls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by
what they inherit from their father. A child who inherits
an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one
who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.

Variations arising during the process of reproduction can be inherited.

Sexually reproducing individuals have two copies of genes for the same trait. If the

Light – Reflection and

CHAPTER
W
e see a variety of objects in the world around us. However, we are
unable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,
things become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the
sunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.
This reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.
We are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted
through it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena
associated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling
of stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium
and so on.  A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.
By observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may
conclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small
source of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this
straight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.
More to Know!
If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to
bend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of
light. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena
such as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study
in higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that
the wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of
light with matter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. This
confusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern
quantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ –
the new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.
In this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and
refraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic
concepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in
nature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light
by spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real
life situations.

A highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the light
falling on it. You are already familiar with the laws of reflection of light.
Reprint 2025-26
Light – Reflection and Refraction
135
Let us recall these laws –
(i)
The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and
(ii)
The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence
and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.
These laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces
including spherical surfaces. You are familiar with the formation of image
by a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formed
by a plane mirror is always virtual and erect.  The size of the image is
equal to that of the object.  The image formed is as far behind the mirror
as the object is in front of it.  Further, the image is laterally inverted.
How would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let
us explore.

The curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved
mirror.  The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical
mirror.  The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form
a part of the surface of a sphere.  Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces
are spherical, are called spherical mirrors.  We shall now study about
spherical mirrors in some detail.

The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or
outwards.  A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,
that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.
A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called
a convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown
in Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back
of the mirror is shaded.
You may now understand that the surface of the spoon
curved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror
and the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be
approximated to a convex mirror.
Before we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to
recognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These
terms are commonly used in discussions about spherical
mirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is a point called the pole.  It lies on the surface of the
mirror.  The pole is usually represented by the letter P.

The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.
This sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of
the spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the
centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting
surface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.
However, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may
note this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the
reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius
of curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may note
that the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight
line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical
mirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal
axis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important
term related to mirrors, through an Activity.

CAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirror
reflecting sunlight. It may damage your eyes.
n
Hold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface
towards the Sun.
n
Direct the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held
close to the mirror.
n
Move the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find
on the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.
n
Hold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few
minutes. What do you observe? Why?
The paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it
may even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged
at a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of light
is the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is
the focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to
the concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance
of this image from the position of the mirror gives the
approximate value of focal length of the mirror.
Let us try to understand this observation with the help
of a ray diagram.
Observe Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel
to the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe
the reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a
point on the principal axis of the mirror.  This point is called
the principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observe
Fig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,
reflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to
come from a point on the principal axis. This point is called
the principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focus
is represented by the letter F. The distance between the
pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called
the focal length. It is represented by the letter f.

The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.
The surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting
surface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN
represents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only such
spherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of
curvature.
Is there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal
length f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,
the radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We
put this as R = 2f .  This implies that the principal focus of a spherical
mirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.
9.2.1  Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors
You have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors. You also
know the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.
How about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locate
the image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?
Are the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have
the same size? We shall explore this with an Activity.

concave mirror. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp bright
spot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. It
was a tiny, real, inverted image. You got the approximate focal length
of the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from
the mirror.
n
Take a concave mirror.  Find out its approximate focal length in
the way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (You
can also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a
sheet of paper.)
n
Mark a line on a Table with a chalk.  Place the concave mirror on
a stand.  Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over
the line.
n
Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line
such that the distance between any two successive lines is equal
to the focal length of the mirror. These lines will now correspond
to the positions of the points P, F and C, respectively. Remember –
For a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F lies
mid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.
n
Keep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond
C.  Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you
obtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it.
n
Observe the image carefully.  Note down its nature, position and
relative size with respect to the object size.
n
Repeat the activity by placing the candle – (a) just beyond C,
(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F, and (e) between P and F.

In one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen.

You will see in the above Activity that the nature, position and size of
the image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the
object in relation to points P, F and C. The image formed is real for some
positions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other
position. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,
depending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations
is given for your reference in Table 9.1.
9.2.2
Representation of Images Formed by Spherical
Mirrors Using Ray Diagrams
We can also study the formation of images by spherical mirrors by
drawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed
in front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended object
acts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each
of these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the
image of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a
point could be considered.  However, it is more convenient to consider
only two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are
so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the
mirror.
The intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image
of the point object.  Any two of the following rays can be considered for
locating the image.
(i)
A ray parallel to the principal
axis, after reflection, will pass
through the principal focus
in case of a concave mirror
or appear to diverge from
the principal focus in
case of a convex mirror.
This is illustrated in Fig.9.3

directed 
towards 
the
principal focus of a convex
mirror, after reflection, will
emerge parallel to the
principal axis. This is

(iii)
A ray passing through the

concave mirror or directed
in the direction of the centre
of curvature of a convex
mirror, after reflection, is
reflected back along the

along the same path
because the incident rays
fall on the mirror along the
normal to the reflecting
surface.

A ray incident obliquely to
the principal axis, towards
a point P (pole of the mirror),
on the concave mirror
[Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex

adjoining the wall.
Uses of convex mirrors
Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in
vehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the
driver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex
mirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though
diminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved
outwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger
area than would be possible with a plane mirror.

9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors
While dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall
follow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign
Convention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the
origin (Fig. 9.9).  The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis
(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –
(i)
The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies
that the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand
side.
(ii)
All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the
pole of the mirror.
(iii)
All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along
+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of
the origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.
(iv)
Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis
(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.
(v)
Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis
(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.
Reprint 2025-26
Light – Reflection and Refraction
143
The New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in
Fig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain
the mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.
9.2.4  Mirror Formula and  Magnification
In a spherical mirror, the distance of the
object from its pole is called the object
distance (u).  The distance of the image from
the pole of the mirror is called the image
distance (v). You already know that the
distance of the principal focus from the pole
is called the focal length (f). There is a
relationship between these three quantities
given by the mirror formula which is
expressed as
1
1
1
v
u
f
+
=
(9.1)
This formula is valid in all situations for all
spherical mirrors for all positions of the
object. You must use the New Cartesian Sign
Convention while substituting numerical
values for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula
for solving problems.
Magnification
Magnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to
which the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.
It is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the
object. It is usually represented by the letter m.
If h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then
the magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by
m = 
Height of the image (
)
Height of the object ( )
′
h

m =

The magnification m is also related to the object distance (u) and
image distance (v).  It can be expressed as:
Magnification (m)  = 
′ = −
h
h
v
u
(9.3)
You may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as
the object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the
image should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However, it is to be
taken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the
magnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value
of the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.

Light seems to travel along straight-line paths in a transparent medium.
What happens when light enters from one transparent medium to
another? Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its
direction? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.
You might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond
containing water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab
is placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed
through the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil
partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced
at the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemon
kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual
size, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such
experiences?
Let us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil,
partly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of the
pencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared
to the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at
the interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when
seen through a glass slab placed over it.
Does a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead of
water, we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? Will the letters appear
to rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent
plastic slab? You will find that the extent of the effect is different for
different pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not

obliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of
light in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as
refraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing

9.3.1 Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab
To understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through a glass
slab, let us do an Activity.

In this Activity, you will note, the light ray has changed its direction
at points O and O′. Note that both the points O and O′ lie on surfaces
separating two transparent media. Draw a perpendicular NN’ to AB at O
and another perpendicular MM′ to CD at O′. The light ray at point O has
entered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to
glass. Note that the light ray has bent towards
the normal. At O′, the light ray has entered
from glass to air, that is, from a denser
medium to a rarer medium.  The light here
has bent away from the normal. Compare the
angle of incidence with the angle of refraction
at both refracting surfaces AB and CD.
In Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely
incident on surface AB, called incident ray.
OO′ is the refracted ray and O′ H is the
emergent ray. You may observe that the
emergent ray is parallel to the direction of
the incident ray. Why does it happen so? The
extent of bending of the ray of light at the
opposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)
and CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular
glass slab is equal and opposite. This is why
the ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.
However, the light ray is shifted sideward
slightly. What happens when a light ray is
incident normally to the interface of two
media? Try and find out.
Now you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to
change in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to
another.  Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to
certain laws.

The following are the laws of refraction of light.
 (i)
The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface
of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the
same plane.
(ii)
The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of
refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for
the given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of
refraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)
If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,
sin
sin

r  = constant
(9.4)
This constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium
with respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.
9.3.2 The Refractive Index
You have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from
one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the
second medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place
in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,
the “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).
The refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,
the relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns
out that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light
travels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1.  In air, the speed of
light is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces
considerably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a
given pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as
given below.
Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as
shown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the
speed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect
to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and
the speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol
n21. This can be expressed in an equation form as
n21= Speed of light in medium 1 
Speed of light in medium 2 = v

(9.5)
By the same argument, the refractive index of medium
1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is given
by
n12= Speed of light in medium 2 
Speed of light in medium 1 = v
v

(9.6)
If medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2
is considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractive
index of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed of

The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.
Optical density has a definite connotation.  It is not the same as mass density. We have
been using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually
means  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can
we say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the
one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other.  The other
medium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is higher in a rarer
medium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a
denser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a
denser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.
Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess
greater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive
index, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less
than water.

The absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive
index. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From
the Table you can know that the refractive index of water, nw = 1.33.
This means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of
light in water is equal to 1.33.  Similarly, the refractive index of crown
glass, ng =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places.  However, you
need not memorise the data.

9.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses
You might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to
see tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass
with your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle
or at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker
are examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We
shall discuss these in this section.
A transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both
surfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means
that a lens is bound by at least one spherical
surface. In such lenses, the other surface would
be plane.  A lens may have two spherical
surfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called
a double convex lens. It is simply called a convex
lens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to
the edges. Convex lens converges light rays as
shown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are
also called converging lenses.  Similarly, a double
concave lens is bounded by two spherical
surfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at the
edges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge
light rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses
are also called diverging lenses. A double concave
lens is simply called a concave lens.
A lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,
has two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces
forms a part of a sphere. The centres of these
spheres are called centres of curvature of the lens.
The centre of curvature of a lens is usually
represented by the letter C.  Since there are two
centres of curvature, we may represent them as C1 and C2. An imaginary
straight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is
called its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is

usually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the optical
centre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective
diameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.
We shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose
aperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of
curvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are
called thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays
of light are incident on a lens?  Let us do an Activity to understand this.

Hold a convex lens in your hand. Direct it towards the Sun.
n
Focus the light from the Sun on a sheet of paper. Obtain a sharp
bright image of the Sun.
n
Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while.  Keep
observing the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experience
in Activity 9.2.
The paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire
after a while.  Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes
parallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp
bright spot formed on the paper.  In fact, the bright spot you got on the
paper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a
point generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.
Now, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a
lens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?
This is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens
in Fig.9.12 (b).
Observe Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the
principal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction
from the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point
on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see
now the action of a concave lens.
Observe Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the
principal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction
from the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal
axis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the
concave lens.
If you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you
get another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used
to represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci.  They
are represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from
the optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to
represent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex
lens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the
position of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the
approximate focal length of the lens.

9.3.5 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams

diagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative size
of the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike
of spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays –

9.3.6 Sign Convention for Spherical Lenses
For lenses, we follow sign convention, similar to the one used for spherical
mirrors. We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all
measurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According
to the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of
a concave lens is negative. You must take care to apply appropriate
signs for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height h′.
9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magnification
As we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for
spherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-
distance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f ).  The lens formula
is expressed as

Magnification
The magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical
mirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height
of the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m. If h is the
height of the object and h′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then
the magnification produced by the lens is given by,
m = Height of the Image
Height of the object = h
h
′
(9.9)
Magnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance
u, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by
Magnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u
(9.10)
Example 9.3
A concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should
the object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm
from the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.

lens. The image is two times enlarged.
9.3.8 Power of a Lens
You have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge
light rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of
short focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing
them closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short
focal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal
length. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved
by a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined
as the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P.  The
power P of a lens of focal length f is given by
P = 
1
f

The SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.
If f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,
1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1.
You may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a
concave lens is negative.
Opticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let us
say the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens
prescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,
a lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.
Many optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase
the magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed
in contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, …   as
P = P1 + P2 + P3 + …
The use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.
During eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses
of known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates
the power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination
of two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.
The simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems
to minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,
consisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of
camera, microscopes and telescopes.

CHAPTER
Y
ou have studied in the previous chapter about refraction of light by
lenses. You also studied the nature, position and relative size of
images formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of
the human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects
around us. It has a lens in its structure.  What is the function of the lens
in a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of
vision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter.
We have learnt in the previous chapter about light and some of its
properties. In this chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some of the
optical phenomena in nature. We shall also discuss about rainbow
formation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.
10.1 THE HUMAN EYE
The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.
It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On
closing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,
taste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify
colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human
eye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,
colourful world around us.
The human eye is like a camera.  Its lens
system forms an image on a light-sensitive
screen called the retina. Light enters the eye
through a thin membrane called the cornea.
It forms the transparent bulge on the front
surface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.
The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape
with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the
refraction for the light rays entering the eye
occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The
crystalline lens merely provides the finer
adjustment of focal length required to focus
objects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called iris
behind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the
size of the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light

entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object
on the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous
number of light-sensitive cells.  The light-sensitive cells get activated
upon illumination and generate electrical signals.  These signals are
sent to the brain via the optic nerves.  The brain interprets these signals,
and finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as
they are.
10.1.1 Power of Accommodation
The eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature
can be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the
curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the
muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length
increases.  This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are
looking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This
increases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker.
Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases.  This enables
us to see nearby objects clearly.
The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called
accommodation.  However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be
decreased below a certain minimum limit.  Try to read a printed page by
holding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred
or feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you
must hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  The minimum distance, at
which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the
least distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.
For a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about
25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is
called the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note
here a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and
infinity.
Sometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and
cloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete
loss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.

Sometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.
In such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and
comfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects
of the eye.
There are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These
are (i) myopia or near-sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or far-
sightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia.  These defects can be corrected by
the use of suitable spherical lenses. We discuss below these defects
and their correction.

163
(a)
Myopia
Myopia is also known as near-
sightedness. A person with myopia
can see nearby objects clearly but
cannot see distant objects distinctly.
A person with this defect has the far
point nearer than infinity. Such a
person may see clearly upto a
distance of a few metres. In a myopic
eye, the image of a distant object is
formed in front of the retina [Fig.
10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.
This defect may arise due to (i)
excessive curvature of the eye lens,
or (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This
defect can be corrected by using a
concave lens of suitable power. This
is illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A
concave lens of suitable power will
bring the image back on to the
retina and thus the defect is corrected.
(b)
Hypermetropia
Hypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness.
A person with hypermetropia can see distant
objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects
distinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther
away from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a
person has to keep a reading material much
beyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable
reading. This is because the light rays from a
closeby object are focussed at a point behind the
retina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b). This defect arises
either because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is
too long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.
This defect can be corrected by using a convex
lens of appropriate power. This is illustrated in
Fig. 10.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses
provide the additional focussing power required
for forming the image on the retina.
(c)   Presbyopia
The power of accommodation of the eye usually
decreases with ageing. For most people, the near
point gradually recedes away. They find it difficult
to see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly
without corrective eye-glasses.  This defect is
called Presbyopia.  It arises due to the gradual

type of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.

You have learnt how light gets refracted through a rectangular glass
slab. For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray
is parallel to the incident ray.  However, it is slightly displaced laterally.
How would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a
triangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular
lateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to each other. The angle
between its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now
do an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass
prism.

Why does this happen?
Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the
emergent ray. You may note that a ray of light is entering from air to
glass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards
the normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from
glass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle of
incidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the
prism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?
The peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an
angle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of
deviation. In this case ∠D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of
deviation in the above activity and measure it.

The prism has probably split the incident
white light into a band of colours.  Note the
colours that appear at the two ends of the
colour band. What is the sequence of colours
that you see on the screen? The various
colours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,
Yellow, Orange and Red, as shown in
Fig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help
you to remember the sequence of colours.
The band of the coloured components of a
light beam is called its spectrum. You might
not be able to see all the colours separately.
Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting
of light into its component colours is called dispersion.
You have seen that white light is dispersed
into its seven-colour components by a prism.
Why do we get these colours? Different colours
of light bend through different angles with
respect to the incident ray, as they pass
through a prism. The red light bends the least
while the violet the most. Thus the rays of each
colour emerge along different paths and thus
become distinct. It is the band of distinct
colours that we see in a spectrum.
Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain
the spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of
the spectrum of white light further by using another similar
prism. However, he could not get any more colours. He
then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position
with respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This
allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through
the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging
from the other side of the second prism. This observation
gave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven
colours.
Any light that gives a spectrum similar to that of
sunlight is often referred to as white light.
A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky
after a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion
of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the
atmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction
opposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like
small prisms. They refract and disperse the incident
sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it
again when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due
to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different
colours reach the observer’s eye.
You can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when
you look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water
fountain, with the Sun behind you.

Atmospheric refraction
effects at sunrise and

10.5     ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION
You might have observed the apparent random wavering or
flickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air
rising above a fire or a radiator. The air just above the fire becomes
hotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)
than the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly
less than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of
the refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent
position of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates.
This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction
of light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local
environment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on
a much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.
Twinkling of stars
The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The
starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction
continuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction
occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the
atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position
of the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears
slightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the
horizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not
stationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions
of the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the
previous paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate
point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from
the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star
fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the
star sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which
is the twinkling effect.
Why don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are much
closer to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.
If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number
of point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the
amount of light entering our eye from all the individual
point-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby
nullifying the twinkling effect.
Advance sunrise and delayed sunset
The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual
sunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset
because of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we
mean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.
10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the
Sun with respect to the horizon. The time difference
between actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about
2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at
sunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.

10.6  SCATTERING OF LIGHT
The interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several
spectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of
water in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset
are some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous
class, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.
The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.
However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the
size of the particles is relatively larger.
10.6.1 Tyndall Effect
The earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.
These particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles
of dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine
particles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,
after being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of
scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect
which you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a
fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.
Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can
also be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense
forest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.
The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering
particles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of
larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering
particles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear
white.
10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?
The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size
smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in
scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer
wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8
times greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the
atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter
wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters
our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been
any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears
dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not
prominent at such heights.
You might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour.
Do you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,
it can be seen in the same colour at a distance.

What you have learnt
n
The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its
focal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.
n
The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is
called the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.  For a young
adult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.
n
The common refractive defects of vision include myopia, hypermetropia and
presbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness – the image of distant objects is focussed
before the retina) is corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power.
Hypermetropia (far-sightedness – the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond
the retina) is corrected by using a convex lens of suitable power. The eye loses its
power of accommodation at old age.

The splitting of white light into its component colours is called dispersion.

The ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility.
Gold is the most ductile metal. You will be surprised to know that a wire
of about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold.
It is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be
given different shapes according to our needs.
Can you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels?
Do you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do

You must have seen that the wires that carry current
in your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC)
or a rubber-like material. Why are electric wires coated
with such substances?
What happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce
a sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface
are said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of
metals?
3.1.2 Non-metals
In the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals
as compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,
sulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either  solids
or gases except bromine which is a liquid.
Do non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals?

On the bases of the observations recorded in Table 3.1, discuss the
general physical properties of metals and non-metals in the class. You
must have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their
physical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example –
(i)
All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature.
In Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting

points but gallium and caesium have very low melting points.
These two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm.
(ii)
Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.
(iii)
Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each
form is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is
the hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting
and boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a
conductor of electricity.
(iv)
Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they
can be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting
points.
Elements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals
on the basis of their chemical properties.

Almost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.
Metal  +  Oxygen → Metal oxide
 For example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen
to form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.
2Cu  +  O2  →  2CuO
(Copper)
     (Copper(II) oxide)
Similarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.

Recall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.
We have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal
oxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as
basic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as
bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.
Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –
Al2O3 + 6HCl
→
2AlCl3
+ 3H2O
Al2O3 + 2NaOH
→
2NaAlO2 + H2O
(Sodium
aluminate)
 Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve
in water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in
water to produce alkalis as follows –
Na2O(s) + H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)
K2O(s)
+ H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq)
Reprint 2025-26

We have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not react with
oxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities
towards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so
vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them
and to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.
At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,
aluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The
protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron
does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled
in the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is
coated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do
not react with oxygen even at high temperatures.
Do You Know?
Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium
develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it
resistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the
oxide layer thicker.  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode
and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode
reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer.  This oxide layer can
be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.
After performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium
is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of
magnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.
But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of
zinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a
conclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.

Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen
gas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form
metal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water.
Metal
+ Water →Metal oxide + Hydrogen
Metal oxide + Water →Metal hydroxide
Metals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In
case of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic
that the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.
2K(s)   + 2H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq)  +  H2(g) + heat energy
2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy
The reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is
not sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.
Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)
Calcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed
stick to the surface of the metal.
Magnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water
to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due
to the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.
Metals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or
hot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen.
2Al(s) + 3H2O(g) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)
3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)
Metals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all.

Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is
because HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to
water and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO,
NO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute
HNO3 to evolve H2 gas.
You must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of formation
of bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was
also the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the
order Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and
the temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does
not react with dilute HCl.
Do You Know?
Aqua regia, (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated
hydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve

Reactive metals can displace less
reactive metals from their compounds in
solution or molten form.
We have seen in the previous sections
that all metals are not equally reactive. We
checked the reactivity of various metals
with oxygen, water and acids. But all
metals do not react with these reagents.
So we were not able to put all the metal
samples we had collected in decreasing
order of their reactivity. Displacement
reactions studied in Chapter 1 give better
evidence about the reactivity of metals. It
is simple and easy if metal A displaces
metal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.
Metal A + Salt solution of B → Salt solution of A + Metal B

observations in Activity 3.12?

In the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of
reagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we
learnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We
learnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show
little chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements
as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.
Let us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and
some metals and non-metals.
We can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its
outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell
now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus
of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has
become 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation
Na+. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell

were to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.
After gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,
because its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L
and M shells.  This gives us a chloride anion C1–. So both these elements
can have a give-and-take relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5).

sodium chloride (NaCl). It should be noted that sodium chloride does
not exist as molecules but aggregates of oppositely charged ions.

You may have observed the following general properties for ionic
compounds—
(i)
Physical nature: Ionic compounds are solids and are somewhat
hard because of the strong force of attraction between the positive
and negative ions. These compounds are generally brittle and
break into pieces when pressure is applied.
(ii)
Melting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting
and boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable
amount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic
attraction.
(iii)
Solubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in
water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.
(iv)
Conduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through
a solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution
of an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the
opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the
solution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct
electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible
due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct
electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state
since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely
charged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move
freely and conduct electricity.

The earth’s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains
some soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.
The elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,
are known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high
percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted
from it. These minerals are called ores.
3.4.1 Extraction of Metals
You have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this
knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its
ore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some
are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of
the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free
Reprint 2025-26
Science
50
state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the
free state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as
their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series
(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in
nature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series
(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s
crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that
the ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very
reactive element and is very abundant on the earth.
Thus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the
following three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals
of medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques
are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.

3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores
Ores mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts
of impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must
be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes
Several steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from
ores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is
explained in detail in the following sections.

51
used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences
between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.
Different separation techniques are  accordingly employed.
3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series
Metals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these
metals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar
(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted
into mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury
on further heating.

3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series
The metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,
copper, are moderately reactive. These are usually present as sulphides
or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as
compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,
the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal
oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly
in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The
carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited
air. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that
takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown
as follows –

The metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by
using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc
oxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.
ZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g)
You are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction
explained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds
is also a reduction process.
Besides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,
sometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive
metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing
Reprint 2025-26

52
agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their
compounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with
aluminium powder, the following reaction takes place –
3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) → 3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat
Can you identify the substances that are getting oxidised
and reduced?
These displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The
amount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced
in the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)
with aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked
machine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.
Fe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) → 2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat
3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the Top of the
Activity Series
The metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot
be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,
carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,
aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals
have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained
by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium
are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals
are deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,
chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The
reactions are –
At cathode
Na+ + e– →Na
At anode
      2Cl– →Cl2 + 2e–
Similarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of
aluminium oxide.
3.4.6 Refining of Metals
The metals produced by various reduction processes
described above are not very pure. They contain
impurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.
The most widely used method for refining impure metals
is electrolytic refining.

the metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is
set up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current
through the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode
dissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure

Do You Know?
Pure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for making
jewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,
22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is
alloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.
If one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an
amalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is
less than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and
zinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are
not good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making
electrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low
melting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.
3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion
The rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,
galvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.
Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting
by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is
protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you
reason this out?
Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.
We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is
the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is
because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is
mixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard
and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get
stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed
with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties
of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.
The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a
homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-
metal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,
dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled
to room temperature.

The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy
The iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more
than 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.  They had
developed a process which prevented iron from rusting. For
its quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists
from all parts of the world. The iron pillar is 8 m high and
weighs 6 tonnes (6000 kg).

form and in the combined form.

Look at the items that come in the last column of the above table
filled by you – your teacher will be able to tell you that most of them are
made up of compounds of carbon. Can you think of a method to test
this? What would be the product if a compound containing carbon is
burnt? Do you know of any test to confirm this?
Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed
are all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living
structures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s
crust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only
0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogen-
carbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon
dioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the
importance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter, we will know
about the properties of carbon which make carbon so important to us.
4.1 BONDING IN CARBON – THE COVALENT BOND
In the previous Chapter, we have studied the properties of ionic
compounds. We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling
points and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also
Reprint 2025-26
Carbon and its Compounds
59
saw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these
properties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds.
Most carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we
have seen in Chapter 2. From the data
given in Table 4.1 on the boiling and
melting points of the carbon compounds,
we find that these compounds have low
melting and boiling points as compared
to ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can
conclude that the forces of attraction
between the molecules are not very
strong. Since these compounds are
largely non-conductors of electricity, we
can conclude that the bonding in these
compounds does not give rise to any ions.
In Class IX, we learnt about the
combining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the
number of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic
configuration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would
be the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many
valence electrons will carbon have?
We know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency
to attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas
configuration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either
gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon,
it has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four
electrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose
electrons –
(i)
It could gain four electrons forming C4– anion. But it would be difficult
for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is,
four extra electrons.
(ii)
It could lose four electrons forming C4+ cation. But it would require
a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a
carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two
electrons.
Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with
other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon,
but many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this
manner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both
the atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration.
Before going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple
molecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons.
The simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen.
As you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence
hydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron
to fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a
molecule of hydrogen, H2. This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the

electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas,
helium, which has two electrons in its K shell. We can
depict this using dots or crosses to represent valence
electrons (Fig. 4.1).
The shared pair of electrons is said to constitute a
single covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms.
A single covalent bond is also represented by a line
between the two atoms, as shown in Fig. 4.2.
The atomic number of chlorine is 17. What would be its electronic
configuration and its valency? Chlorine forms a diatomic molecule, Cl2.
Can you draw the electron dot structure for this molecule? Note that
only the valence shell electrons need to be depicted.
In the case of oxygen, we see the formation of a double bond between
two oxygen atoms. This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons
in its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two
more electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two
electrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in
Fig. 4.3. The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to
two shared pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a double bond
between the two atoms.
Can you now depict a molecule of water showing the nature
of bonding between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen
atoms? Does the molecule have single bonds or double bonds?
What would happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of
nitrogen? Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. What would be
its electronic configuration and its combining capacity? In
order to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of
nitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared
pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a triple bond
between the two atoms. The electron dot structure of N2 and
its triple bond can be depicted as in Fig. 4.4.
A molecule of ammonia has the formula NH3. Can you draw
the electron dot structure for this molecule showing how all
four atoms achieve noble gas configuration? Will the molecule
have single, double or triple bonds?
Let us now take a look at methane, which is a compound
of carbon. Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major
component of bio-gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It
is also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon.
Methane has a formula CH4. Hydrogen, as you know, has a
valency of 1. Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence
electrons. In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon
shares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen as shown
in Fig. 4.5.
Such bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair
between two atoms are known as covalent bonds. Covalently bonded
molecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter-
molecular forces are weak. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling

These two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different
physical properties even though their chemical properties are the same. Diamond is
the hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery. Graphite is also
a very good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals that you studied in the
previous Chapter.
Diamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and
temperature. These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable
from natural diamonds.
Fullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. The first one to be identified was
C-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football. Since this looked

atoms and no charged particles are formed, such covalent compounds
are generally poor conductors of electricity.
Allotropes of carbon
The element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with
widely varying physical properties. Both diamond and
graphite are formed by carbon atoms, the difference lies in
the manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one
another. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four
other carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional
structure. In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three
other carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array.
One of these bonds is a double-bond, and thus the valency of
carbon is satisfied. Graphite structure is formed by the
hexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other.

4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON
We have seen the formation of covalent bonds by the sharing of
electrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the
structure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning
of the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In
fact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers
of carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was
recently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large
margin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together.
Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?
The nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number
of compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are –
(i)
Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of
carbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called
catenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon,
branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings.
In addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple
bonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single
bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.
Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their
carbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.
No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent
seen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with
hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these
compounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong
and hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds
with many carbon atoms linked to each other.
(ii)
Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with
four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent
element. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to
compounds with specific properties which depend on the elements
other than carbon present in the molecule.
Again the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are
very strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One
reason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size.
This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons
strongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are
much weaker.
Reprint 2025-26
Carbon and its Compounds

Organic compounds
The two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put
together give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same non-carbon
atom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were
initially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon
compounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is,
it was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler
disproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon
compounds, except for carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate
salts continue to be studied under organic chemistry.

4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds
We have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound
formed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C2H6.
In order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon
compounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms
together with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the
hydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon
(Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived
in the following steps –

Step 1

Three valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied,
so each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving:

Can you draw the structure of propane, which has the molecular
formula C3H8 in a similar manner? You will see that the valencies of all
the atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them. Such carbon
compounds are called saturated compounds. These compounds are
normally not very reactive.
However, another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula
C2H4 and is called ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We follow
the same step-wise approach as above.
Carbon-carbon atoms linked together with a single bond (Step 1).
We see that one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied
(Step 2). This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the
two carbons (Step 3).

The electron dot structure for ethene is given in Fig. 4.7.
Yet another compound of hydrogen and carbon has the formula
C2H2 and is called ethyne. Can you draw the electron dot
structure for ethyne? How many bonds are necessary between
the two carbon atoms in order to satisfy their valencies? Such
compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between
the carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds
and they are more reactive than the saturated carbon
compounds.
4.2.2 Chains, Branches and Rings
In the earlier section, we mentioned the carbon compounds methane,
ethane and propane, containing respectively 1, 2 and 3 carbon atoms.
Such ‘chains’ of carbon atoms can contain many more carbon atoms.
The names and structures of six of these are given in Table 4.2.

‘skeletons’ are –

Figure 4.8 (b) Complete molecules for two structures with formula C4H10
We see that both these structures have the same formula C4H10. Such
compounds with identical molecular formula but different structures
are called structural isomers.
In addition to straight and branched carbon chains, some compounds
have carbon atoms arranged in the form of a ring. For example, cyclohexane
has the formula C6H12 and the following structure –

All these carbon compounds which contain only carbon and
hydrogen are called hydrocarbons. Among these, the saturated
hydrocarbons are called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which
contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing
one or more triple bonds are called alkynes.
4.2.3 Will you be my Friend?
Carbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking at
compounds containing carbon and hydrogen only. But carbon also forms
Reprint 2025-26

66
bonds with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur.
In a hydrocarbon chain, one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these
elements, such that the valency of carbon remains satisfied. In such
compounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom.
These heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in Table 4.3.
These heteroatoms and
the group containing
these confer specific
properties 
to 
the
compound, regardless
of the length and nature
of the carbon chain and
hence 
are 
called
functional groups. Some
important functional
groups are given in the
Table 4.3. Free valency or
valencies of the group
are shown by the single
line. The functional group
is attached to the carbon
chain through this
valency by replacing one
hydrogen   atom or
atoms.
4.2.4 Homologous Series
You have seen that carbon atoms can be linked together to form chains
of varying lengths. These chains can be branched also. In addition,
hydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced
by any of the functional groups that we saw above. The presence of a
functional group such as alcohol decides the properties of the carbon
compound, regardless of the length of the carbon chain. For example,
the chemical properties of CH3OH, C2H5OH, C3H7OH and C4H9OH are all
very similar. Hence, such a series of compounds in which the same
functional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a
homologous series.
Let us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table
4.2. If we look at the formulae of successive compounds, say –
CH4 and C2H6
—
these differ by a –CH2- unit
C2H6 and C3H8
—
these differ by a –CH2- unit
What is the difference between the next pair – propane and butane (C4H10)?
Can you find out the difference in molecular masses between these
pairs (the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen
is 1 u)?
Similarly, take the homologous series for alkenes. The first member
of the series is ethene which we have already come across in
Section 4.2.1. What is the formula for ethene? The succeeding members
have the formula C3H6, C4H8 and C5H10. Do these also differ by a –CH2–

unit? Do you see any relation between the number of carbon and
hydrogen atoms in these compounds? The general formula for alkenes
can be written as CnH2n, where n = 2, 3, 4. Can you similarly generate the
general formula for alkanes and alkynes?
As the molecular mass increases in any homologous series, a
gradation in physical properties is seen. This is because the melting and
boiling points increase with increasing molecular mass. Other physical
properties such as solubility in a particular solvent also show a similar
gradation. But the chemical properties, which are determined solely by
the functional group, remain similar in a homologous series.

4.2.5 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds
The names of compounds in a homologous series are based on the name
of the basic carbon chain modified by a “prefix” “phrase before” or “suffix”
“phrase after” indicating the nature of the functional group. For example,
the names of the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol,
propanol and butanol.
Naming a carbon compound can be done by the following method –
(i)
Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. A compound
having three carbon atoms would have the name propane.
(ii)
In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the
name of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given
in Table 4.4).
(iii)
If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, and the
suffix of the functional group begins with a vowel a, e, i, o, u, then
the name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and
adding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain
with a ketone group would be named in the following manner –
Propane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone.
(iv)
If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name
of the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in
Table 4.4. For example, a three-carbon chain with a double bond
would be called propene and if it has a triple bond, it would be
called propyne.

Saturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while
unsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of
black smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on the metal plate in Activity
4.3. However, limiting the supply of air results in incomplete combustion
of even saturated hydrocarbons giving a sooty flame. The gas/kerosene
stove used at home has inlets for air so that a sufficiently oxygen-rich
Reprint 2025-26

70
mixture is burnt to give a clean blue flame. If you observe the bottoms of
cooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked
and fuel is getting wasted. Fuels such as coal and petroleum have some
amount of nitrogen and sulphur in them. Their combustion results in
the formation of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen which are major
pollutants in the environment.
Do You Know?
Why do substances burn with or without a flame?
Have you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a
chance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You
have seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However,
you will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and
gives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous
substances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present
vapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning.
A luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and
start to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of
that element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its
colour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On
this basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to?
Formation of coal and petroleum
Coal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to
various biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and
other plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth,
perhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of
earth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions
of tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to
the sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning
them into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to.
Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the
porous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you guess why
coal and petroleum are called fossil fuels?

We see that some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others.
These substances are known as oxidising agents.
Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate
are oxidising alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the starting
material. Hence they are known as oxidising agents.
4.3.3 Addition Reaction
Unsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts
such as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts
are substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different
rate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly
used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst.
Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while
animal fats have saturated carbon chains.
You must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils
are ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which
are said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids
should be chosen for cooking.
4.3.4 Substitution Reaction
Saturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence
of most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added
to hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen
atoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type
of atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of
products are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.

4.4.1 Properties of Ethanol
Ethanol is a liquid at room temperature (refer to Table 4.1 for the melting
and boiling points of ethanol). Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and
is the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a
good solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough
syrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all
proportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes
drunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially
widespread practice. However, intake of even a small quantity of pure
ethanol (called absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term
consumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.

The concentrated sulphuric acid can be regarded as a dehydrating
agent which removes water from ethanol.
How do alcohols affect living beings?
When large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to slow metabolic processes
and to depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination,
mental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupor.
The individual may feel relaxed without realising that his sense of judgement, sense
of timing, and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired.
Unlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol
is oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of
cells. It coagulates the protoplasm, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by
cooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness.
Ethanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced
for industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances
like methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue so that it can be
identified easily. This is called denatured alcohol.

4.4.2 Properties of Ethanoic Acid
Ethanoic acid is commonly called acetic acid and
belongs to a group of acids called carboxylic
acids. 5-8% solution of acetic acid in water is
called vinegar and is used widely as a preservative
in pickles. The melting point of pure ethanoic acid
is 290 K and hence it often freezes during winter
in cold climates. This gave rise to its name glacial
acetic acid.
The group of organic compounds called
carboxylic acids are obviously characterised by
their acidic nature. However, unlike mineral acids
like HCl, which are completely ionised, carboxylic
acids are weak acids.

Generally, esters are sweet-smelling substances. These are used in
making perfumes and as flavouring agents. On treating with sodium
hydroxide, which is an alkali, the ester is converted back to  alcohol
and sodium salt of carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as
saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap. Soaps
are sodium or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acid.

Alcohol as a fuel
Sugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical
energy. Sugarcane juice can be used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give
alcohol (ethanol). Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a
cleaner fuel which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient
air (oxygen).

This activity demonstrates the effect of soap in cleaning. Most dirt is
oily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The
molecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic
acids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain
interacts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called
micelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil
droplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in
water. The soap micelle thus helps  in pulling out the dirt in water and
we can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).
Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if
you dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?
Micelles
Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,
that is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts
with hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap
will not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the
ionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water,
these molecules have a unique orientation that keeps
the hydrocarbon portion out of the water. Thus,
clusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails
are in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends
are on the surface of the cluster. This formation is
called a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able
to clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the
centre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as
a colloid and will not come together to precipitate
because of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt
suspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away.
The soap micelles are large enough to scatter light.
Hence a soap solution appears cloudy.

2.
People use a variety of methods to wash clothes. Usually after adding
the soap, they ‘beat’ the clothes on a stone, or beat it with a paddle,
scrub with a brush or the mixture is agitated in a washing machine.
Why is agitation necessary to get clean clothes?
Have you ever observed while bathing that foam is formed with
difficulty and an insoluble substance (scum) remains after washing with
water? This is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and
magnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. Hence you need
to use a larger amount of soap. This problem is overcome by using
another class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents.
Detergents are generally sodium salts of sulphonic acids or ammonium
salts with chlorides or bromides ions, etc. Both have long hydrocarbon
chain. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble
precipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Thus,
they remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make
shampoos and products for cleaning clothes.

Carbon is a versatile element that forms the basis for all living organisms and many
of the things we use.
n
This large variety of compounds is formed by carbon because of its tetravalency
and the property of catenation that it exhibits.
n
Covalent bonds are formed by the sharing of electrons between two atoms so that
both can achieve a completely filled outermost shell.
n
Carbon forms covalent bonds with itself and other elements such as hydrogen,
oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen and chlorine.
n
Carbon also forms compounds containing double and triple bonds between carbon
atoms. These carbon chains may be in the form of straight chains, branched chains
or rings.
n
The ability of carbon to form chains gives rise to a homologous series of compounds
in which the same functional group is attached to carbon chains of different lengths.
n
The functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids
bestow characteristic properties to the carbon compounds that contain them.
n
Carbon and its compounds are some of our major sources of fuels.
n
Ethanol and ethanoic acid are carbon compounds of importance in our daily lives.
n
The action of soaps and detergents is based on the presence of both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic groups in the molecule and this helps to emulsify the oily dirt and
hence its removal.

CHAPTER
H
ow do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not
alive? If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man
shouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What
if the dog or the cow or the man were asleep? We would still think that
they were alive, but how did we know that? We see them breathing, and
we know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that
they are alive? We see them green, some of us will say. But what about
plants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over
time, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we
tend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as
common evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is
still alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So
using visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.
Movements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye –
movements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular
movement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional
biologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular
movement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why
there is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not.
Why are molecular movements needed for life? We have seen in earlier
classes that living organisms are well-organised structures; they can
have tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them,
and so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised,
ordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down
over time. If order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive. So
living creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures.
Since all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move
molecules around all the time.
What are the maintenance processes in living organisms?
Let us explore.

Reprint 2025-26
Science
80
class, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on.
The processes which together perform this maintenance job are
life processes.
Since these maintenance processes are needed to prevent damage
and break-down, energy is needed for them. This energy comes from
outside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process
to transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,
which we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition.
If the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will
also be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-
based molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based.
Depending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different
organisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.
The outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the
environment is not under the control of the individual organism. These
sources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the
body, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that
can be used for the various molecular movements needed for
maintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the
body needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the
body are necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most
common chemical means to break-down molecules. For this, many
organisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process
of acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it in the process
of break-down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call
respiration.
In the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking
in food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because
the entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.
But what happens when the body size of the organism increases and
the body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,
all the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding
environment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of
all the cells.
We have seen previously how, in multi-cellular organisms, various
body parts have specialised in the functions they perform. We are familiar
with the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in
the body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake
of food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues.
However, this poses a problem, since the food and oxygen are now taken
up at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body
need them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for
carrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body.
When chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for
energy generation,  they create by-products that are not only useless
for the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-
products are  therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded
outside  by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body
Reprint 2025-26
Life Processes
81
design in multi-cellular organisms are followed, a specialised tissue for
excretion will be developed, which means that the transportation system
will need to transport waste away from cells to this excretory tissue.
Let us consider these various processes, so essential to maintain
life, one by one.

When we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we
are not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a
state of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order
to grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in
the body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.
How do living things get their food?
The general requirement for energy and materials is common in all
organisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple
food material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon
dioxide and water. These organisms, the autotrophs, include green
plants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.
These complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones
before they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To
achieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the
heterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.
Heterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.
5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition
Carbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are
fulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take
in substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of
energy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water
which is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and
chlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.
We will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates
which are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which
serves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required
by the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of
the energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form
of glycogen.

n Take out the leaf and rinse off the iodine solution.
n Observe the colour of the leaf and compare this with the tracing of
the leaf done in the beginning (Fig. 5.2).
n What can you conclude about the presence of starch in various areas
of the leaf?
(i)
Absorption of light energy by
chlorophyll.
(ii)
Conversion of light energy to chemical
energy and splitting of water molecules
into hydrogen and oxygen.
(iii)
Reduction of carbon dioxide to
carbohydrates.
These steps need not take place one after
the other immediately. For example, desert
plants take up carbon dioxide at night and
prepare an intermediate which is acted upon
by the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll
during the day.
Let us see how each of the components of
the above reaction are necessary for
photosynthesis.
If you carefully observe a cross-section of a
leaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 5.1),
you will notice that some cells contain green
dots. These green dots are cell organelles called
chloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us
do an activity which demonstrates that
chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.
Reprint 2025-26
Life Processes
83
Now, let us study how the plant
obtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX,
we had talked about stomata (Fig. 5.3)
which are tiny pores present on the
surface of the leaves. Massive amounts
of gaseous exchange takes place in the
leaves through these pores for the
purpose of photosynthesis. But it is
important to note here that exchange
of gases occurs across the surface of
stems, roots and leaves as well. Since
large amounts of water can also be lost
through these stomata, the plant
closes these pores when it does not
need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the
pore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water
flows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore
closes if the guard cells shrink.
n
Take two healthy potted plants
which are nearly the same size.
n
Keep them in a dark room for
three days.
n
Now place each plant on
separate glass plates. Place a
watch-glass containing potassium
hydroxide by the side of one of
the plants. The potassium
hydroxide is used to absorb
carbon dioxide.
n
Cover both plants with separate
bell-jars as shown in Fig. 5.4.
n
Use vaseline to seal the bottom
of the jars to the glass plates so
that the set-up is air-tight.
n
Keep the plants in sunlight for
about two hours.
n
Pluck a leaf from each plant and check for the presence of starch as in the above activity.
n
Do both the leaves show the presence of the same amount of starch?
n
What can you conclude from this activity?

Based on the two activities performed above, can we design an
experiment to demonstrate that sunlight is essential for photosynthesis?
So far, we have talked about how autotrophs meet their energy
requirements. But they also need other raw materials for building their
body. Water used in photosynthesis is taken up from the soil by the
roots in terrestrial plants. Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus,
iron and magnesium are taken up from the soil. Nitrogen is an essential
element used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. This is

taken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as
organic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from
atmospheric nitrogen.
5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition
Each organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition
differs depending on the type and availability of food material as well
as how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food
source is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would
allow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive
apparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by
which the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms
break-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.
Examples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others
take in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can
be taken in and broken down depends on the body design and
functioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or
animals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used
by a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice,
leeches and tape-worms.
5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?
Since the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is
different in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food
may be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the
organism increases, different parts become specialised to perform
different functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using
temporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over
the food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-
vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones
which then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested
material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In
Paramoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a
definite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved
to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface
of the cell.
5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings
The alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth
to the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts.
Various regions are specialised to perform different functions. What
happens to the food once it enters our body? We shall discuss this
process here.

What does this tell us about the action of saliva on starch?
We eat various types of food which has to pass through the same
digestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate
particles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by
crushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the
food is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something
we like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid
called saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food
we ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary
canal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the
help of biological catalysts called
enzymes. The saliva contains an
enzyme called salivary amylase that
breaks down starch which is a complex
molecule to give simple sugar. The food
is mixed thoroughly with saliva and
moved around the mouth while
chewing by the muscular tongue.
It is necessary to move the food in
a regulated manner along the digestive
tube so that it can be processed
properly in each part. The lining of
canal has muscles that contract
rhythmically in order to push the food
forward. These peristaltic movements
occur all along the gut.
From the mouth, the food is taken
to the stomach through the food-pipe
or oesophagus. The stomach is a large
organ which expands when food
enters it. The muscular walls of the
stomach help in mixing the food
thoroughly with more digestive juices.
The digestion in stomach is taken
care of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These
release hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,
and mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which
facilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you
think is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the
stomach from the action of the acid under normal conditions. We

have often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related
to what has been discussed above?
The exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle
which releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the
stomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part
of the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of
extensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various
animals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a
longer small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier
to digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.
The small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of
carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver
and pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is
acidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.
Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.
Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes
it difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into
smaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar
to the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in
Chapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains
enzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down
emulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which
secrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the
proteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats
into fatty acids and glycerol.
Digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner
lining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called
villi which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly
supplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and
every cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building
up new tissues and the repair of old tissues.
The unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall
absorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed
from the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated
by the anal sphincter.

Dental caries
Dental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins
when bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.
Masses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental
plaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers
the teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria
produce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing
inflammation and infection.

What does this tell us about the products of fermentation?
We have discussed nutrition in organisms in the last section. The
food material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to
provide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in
different ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely
into carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not
involve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of
glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called
pyruvate. This process takes place in the cytoplasm. Further, the
pyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process
takes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place
in the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-
down of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. This

process breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three
molecules of carbon dioxide. The other product is water. Since this
process takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic
respiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater
than in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen
in our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is
taken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a
three-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during
sudden activity causes cramps.

The energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used
to synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other
activities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise
to a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions
taking place in the cell.
ATP
ATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes. The energy released during
the process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic
phosphate.
Endothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions. When the
terminal phosphate linkage in ATP is broken using water, the energy equivalent to
30.5 kJ/mol is released.
Think of how a battery can provide energy for many different kinds of uses. It can be
used to obtain mechanical energy, light energy, electrical energy and so on. Similarly,
ATP can be used in the cells for the contraction of muscles, protein synthesis,
conduction of nervous impulses and many other activities.
Since the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic
organisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen. We
have seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large
inter-cellular spaces ensure that all cells are in contact with air. Carbon
dioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here. They can go into

cells, or away from them and out into the air. The direction of diffusion
depends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of
the plant. At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, CO2
elimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day,
CO2 generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence
there is no CO2 release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at
this time.
Animals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen
from the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide
produced. Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the
atmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen
dissolved in water.

manner?
n
Count the number of times the fish opens and closes its mouth in

n
Compare this to the number of times you breathe in and out in a

Since the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared
to the amount of oxygen in the air, the rate of breathing in aquatic
organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms.
Fishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the
gills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood.
Terrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for
respiration. This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in
different animals. All these organs have a structure that increases
the surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich
atmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide
has to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine
and delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed
within the body, so there have to be passages that will take air
to this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air
in and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.
In human beings (Fig. 5.9), air is taken into the body through
the nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by
fine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with
mucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes
through the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are
present in the throat. These ensure that the air-passage does
not collapse.

Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller
tubes which finally terminate in balloon-like structures which
are called alveoli (singular–alveolus). The alveoli provide a surface
where the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli
contain an extensive network of blood-vessels. As we have seen
in earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten
our diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result.
Because of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded
alveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body
for release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is
taken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported
to all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is
taken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume
of air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed
and for the carbon dioxide to be released.
When the body size of animals is large,  the diffusion pressure
alone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body.
Instead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the
lungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before
releasing it. In human beings, the respiratory pigment is
haemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen. This pigment
is present in the red blood corpuscles. Carbon dioxide is more
soluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in
the dissolved form in our blood.

We have seen in previous sections that blood transports food, oxygen
and waste materials in our bodies. In Class IX, we learnt about blood
being a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called
plasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon
dioxide and nitrogenous wastes in dissolved form. Oxygen is carried by
the red blood corpuscles. Many other substances like salts, are also
transported by the blood. We thus need a pumping organ to push blood
around the body, a network of tubes to reach all the tissues and a system
in place to ensure that this network can be repaired if damaged.

The heart is a muscular organ which is
as big as our fist (Fig. 5.10). Because
both oxygen and carbon dioxide have to
be transported by the blood, the heart
has different chambers to prevent the
oxygen-rich blood from mixing with the
blood containing carbon dioxide. The
carbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach
the lungs for the carbon dioxide to be
removed, and the oxygenated blood from
the lungs has to be brought back to the
heart. This oxygen-rich blood is then
pumped to the rest of the body.
We can follow this process step by
step (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from
the lungs comes to the thin-walled upper
chamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes
when it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber,
the left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the
muscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to
the body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper
chamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium
contracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates.
This transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the
lungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various
organs, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure
that blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.
Oxygen enters the blood in the lungs
The separation of the right side and the left side of
the heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-
oxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation
allows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the
body. This is useful in animals that have high
energy needs, such as birds and mammals, which
constantly use energy to maintain their body
temperature. In animals that do not use energy
for this purpose, the body temperature depends
on the temperature in the environment. Such
animals, like amphibians or  many reptiles have
three-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing
of the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood
streams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two
chambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped
to the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly
to the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once
through the heart in the fish during one cycle of
passage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart
twice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double
circulation.

Blood pressure is measured with an instrument called sphygmomanometer. High
blood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of
arterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture
of an artery and internal bleeding.
Blood pressure
The force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This
pressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the
artery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure
in artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal
systolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.
The tubes – blood vessels
Arteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various
organs of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high
pressure, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. Veins collect the blood
from different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need
thick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they
have valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.
On reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and
smaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells.
The smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called
capillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding
cells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together
to form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue.
Maintenance by platelets
What happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about
situations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of
blood from the system has to be minimised. In addition, leakage would
lead to a loss of pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the
Reprint 2025-26

94
pumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate
around the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at
these points of injury.
Lymph
There is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is
called lymph or tissue fluid. Through the pores present in the walls of
capillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into
intercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is
similar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein.
Lymph drains into lymphatic capillaries from the intercellular spaces,
which join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins.
Lymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess
fluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.
5.4.2 Transportation in Plants
We have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such
as CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing
organs, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for
building plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,
the soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,
phosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances
therefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.
If the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-
containing organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse
to all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because
of changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient
to provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of
transportation is therefore essential in such situations.
Energy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not
move, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many
tissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively
slow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems
have to operate, however, can be very large in plants such as very tall
trees.
Plant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw
materials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as
independently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water
and minerals obtained from the soil. The other, phloem transports
products of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised
to other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues
in detail in Class IX.
Transport of water
In xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are
interconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting
channels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact
with the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the
concentration of these ions between the root and the soil. Water, therefore,
Reprint 2025-26
Life Processes
95
moves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means
that there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column
of water that is steadily pushed upwards.
However, this pressure by itself is unlikely to be enough to move
water over the heights that we commonly see in plants. Plants use another
strategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the
plant body.

n

Do you observe any difference in the two cases?
Provided that the plant has an adequate
supply of water, the water which is lost through the
stomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels
in the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from
the cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water
from the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the
form of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is
known as transpiration.
Thus, transpiration helps in the absorption and
upward movement of water and minerals dissolved
in it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in
temperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in
transport of water is more important at night. During
the day when the stomata are open, the transpiration
pull becomes the major driving force in the movement
of water in the xylem.
Transport of food and other substances
So far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants.
Now let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly
photosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other
parts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis
is called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue
known as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem
transports amino acids and other substances. These substances are
especially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and
to growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes
place in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both
in upward and downward directions.
Unlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple
physical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising

energy. Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using
energy from ATP. This increases the osmotic pressure of the tissue
causing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the
phloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to
move material according to the plant’s needs. For example, in the spring,
sugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds
which need energy to grow.

We have already discussed how organisms get rid of gaseous wastes
generated during photosynthesis or respiration. Other metabolic activities
generate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological
process involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from
the body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to
do this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple
diffusion from the body surface into the surrounding
water. As we have seen in other processes, complex
multi-cellular organisms use specialised organs to
perform the same function.
5.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings
The excretory system of human beings (Fig. 5.13)
includes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary
bladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the
abdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine
produced in the kidneys passes through the ureters
into the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is
released through the urethra.
How is urine produced? The purpose of making
urine is to filter out waste products from the blood.
Just as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs,
nitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are
removed from blood in the kidneys. It is then no
surprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,
Figure 5.13
Excretory system in human beings
Reprint 2025-26
Life Processes
97
like in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood
capillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is
associated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube
called Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate
 (Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these
filtration units called nephrons packed close together.
Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,
amino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are
selectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube.
The amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much
excess water there is in the body, and on how much of
dissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming
in each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter,
which connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder.
Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure
of the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out
through the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is
under nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere.
As a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.

Kidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted
blood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of
poisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney
failure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove
nitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.
Artificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended
in a tank filled with dialysing fluid.
This fluid has the same osmotic
pressure as blood, except that it is
devoid of nitrogenous wastes. The
patient’s blood is passed through
these tubes. During this passage,
the waste products from the blood
pass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.
The purified blood is pumped back
into the patient. This is similar to the
function of the kidney, but it is
different since there is no re-
absorption involved. Normally, in a
healthy adult, the initial filtrate in the
kidneys is about 180 L daily.
However, the volume actually
excreted is only a litre or two a day,
because the remaining filtrate is re-
absorbed in the kidney tubules.

5.5.2 Excretion in Plants
Plants use completely different
strategies for excretion than those
of animals. Oxygen itself can be
thought of as a waste product
generated during photosynthesis!
We have discussed earlier how
plants deal with oxygen as well as
CO2. They can get rid of excess water
by transpiration. For other wastes,
plants use the fact that many of
their tissues consist of dead cells,
and that they can even lose some
parts such as leaves. Many plant
waste products are stored in
cellular vacuoles. Waste products
may be stored in leaves that fall off.
Other waste products are stored as
resins and gums, especially in old
xylem. Plants also excrete some
waste substances into the soil
around them.
What you have learnt
n
Movement of various types can be taken as an indication of life.
n
Maintenance of life requires processes like nutrition, respiration, transport of
materials within the body and excretion of waste products.
n
Autotrophic nutrition involves the intake of simple inorganic materials from the
environment and using an external energy source like the Sun to synthesise complex
high-energy organic material.
n
Heterotrophic nutrition involves the intake of complex material prepared by other
organisms.
n
In human beings, the food eaten is broken down by various steps along the
alimentary canal and the digested food is absorbed in the small intestine to be sent
to all cells in the body.
Think it over!
Organ donation
Organ donation is a generous act of donating an
organ to a person who suffers from non-function of
organ(s). Donation of an organ may be done by the
consent of the donor and his/her family. Anyone
regardless of age or gender can become an organ
and tissue donor. Organ transplants can save or
transform the life of a person. Transplantation is
required because recipient’s organ has been
damaged or has failed by disease or injury. In organ
transplantation the organ is surgically removed
from one person (organ donor) and transplanted to
another person (the recipient). Common
transplantations include corneas, kidneys, heart,
liver, pancreas, lungs, intestines and bone marrow.
Most organ and tissue donations occur just after
the donor has died or when the doctor declares a
person brain dead. But some organs such as
kidney, part of a liver, lung, etc., and tissues can be
donated while the donor is alive.

CHAPTER
I
n the previous chapter, we looked at life processes involved in the
maintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with
a notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of
these movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed
germinates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the
course of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth
were to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some
movements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected
with growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes
chewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.
Why do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible
answer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the
environment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has
seen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt
by living organisms to use changes in their environment to their
advantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure
and fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough
food so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on
our eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond
to it with movement in order to protect ourselves.
If we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this
movement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each
kind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement
in response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,
rather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends
on the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement
must be connected to the recognition of various events in the
environment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other
words, living organisms must use systems providing control and
coordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation
in multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these
control and coordination activities.

object is an urgent and dangerous
situation for us. We need to detect it,
and respond to it. How do we detect that
we are touching a hot object? All
information from our environment is
detected by the specialised tips of some
nerve cells. These receptors are usually
located in our sense organs, such as the
inner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so
on. So gustatory receptors will detect taste
while olfactory receptors will detect smell.
This information, acquired at the
end of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell
[Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction
that creates an electrical impulse. This
impulse travels from the dendrite to the
cell body, and then along the axon to its
end. At the end of the axon, the electrical
impulse sets off the release of some
chemicals. These chemicals cross the
gap, or synapse, and start a similar
electrical impulse in a dendrite of the next
neuron. This is a general scheme of how
nervous impulses travel in the body. A
similar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to
other cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].
It is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised
network of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting
information via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.
Look at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where
information is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an
electrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a
chemical signal for onward transmission.

6.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?
‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden
action in response to something in the environment. We say ‘I jumped
out of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the
flame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.
What exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that
we do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control
of our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with
some action to changes in our environment. How is control and
coordination achieved in such situations?
Let us consider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a
flame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any
animal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to
think consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,
and therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long
will it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If
nerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier,
then thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.
Thinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated
interaction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.
If this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our
body consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits
in the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the
body which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in
order to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull
must be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.
Similarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves
must carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is
to be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to
get burnt!
How does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than
having to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat
were to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,
the process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by
an output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is
commonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc
connections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?
The best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet
each other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal
cord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord
itself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.
Of course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking
process of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very
little or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is
quite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning
in the absence of true thought processes.  However, even after complex
neuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be
more efficient for quick responses.

Can you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright
light is focussed on your eyes?
6.1.2 Human Brain
Is reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since
we know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves
which supply information to think about. Thinking involves more
complex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated
in the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The
brain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).
They receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.
We also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair,
clapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions
which are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to
send messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous
system communicates with the muscles.  The communication between
the central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated
by the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising
from the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain
thus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you
will expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different
parts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.
The brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,
mid-brain and hind-brain.
The fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions
which receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas
of the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There
are separate areas of association where this sensory information is
interpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors
as well as with information that is already stored in the brain.  Based on
Figure 6.2 
Figure 6.2 
Figure 6.2 
Figure 6.2 
Figure 6.2 Reflex arc
Reprint 2025-26
Science
104
all this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is
passed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary
muscles, for example, our leg muscles.  However, certain sensations are
distinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we
have eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre
associated with  hunger, which is in a separate part of the fore-brain.
Study the labelled diagram of the human brain. We have seen that
the different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function
of each part?
Let us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked
about in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like
without our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.
In fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them
even if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe
or digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in
the size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a
chair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not
have any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are
controlled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions
including blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the
medulla in the hind-brain.
Think about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,
picking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain
called the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions
and maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what
would happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not
thinking about it.

6.1.3 How are these Tissues protected?
A delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of
activities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed
so that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is
contained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock
absorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you
will feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or
backbone which protects the spinal cord.
6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?
So far, we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects
information, sends it around the body, processes information, makes
decisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for
action. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,
muscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When
a nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How
does a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular
level is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they
shorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?
The answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle
cells have special proteins that change both their shape and their
arrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When
this happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells
a shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in
Class IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles
and involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far, what
do you think the differences between these would be?

Animals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the
activities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor
muscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves
of a chhui-mui (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa
family), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the
root goes down, the stem comes up into the air. What happens? Firstly,
the leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.
Reprint 2025-26
Science
106
There is no growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the
directional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented
from growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different
types of movement – one dependent on growth and the other independent
of growth.
6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus
Let us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive
plant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves
in response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle
tissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move
in response?
Figure 6.4
Figure 6.4
Figure 6.4
Figure 6.4
Figure 6.4 The sensitive plant
If we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part
of the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a
point different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has
occurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical
means to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,
there is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.
Finally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for
movement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal
muscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water
in them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing
shapes (Fig. 6.4).
6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth
Some plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means
of tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in
contact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object
does not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.
This causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.
More commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a
particular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if
the plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the
help of an example.
Reprint 2025-26
Control and Coordination
107
Environmental triggers such as light, or gravity
will change the directions that plant parts grow in.
These directional, or tropic, movements can be either
towards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two
different kinds of phototropic movement, shoots
respond by bending towards light while roots
respond by bending away from it. How does this help
the plant?
Plants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots
of a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow
upwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth
of shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity
is, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’
refers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’
mean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth
movements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes
towards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the
reproductive processes of living organisms.
Let us now once again think about how information is communicated
in the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the
sensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of
sunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.
Growth-related movement of plants will be even slower.
Even in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to
growth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.
So controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to
stimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly.
For this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.

Electrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are
limitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only
those cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell
in the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in
a cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms
before it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells
cannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no
wonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of
communication between cells, namely, chemical communication.
If, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release
a chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the
original cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound
using special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to
recognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course,
but it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous
connections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These
compounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control
and coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.
Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and
responses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from
where they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.
Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].
When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised
at the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from
one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.
This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the
side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to
bend towards light.
Another example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like
auxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,
and it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in
areas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples
of plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need
signals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which
inhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.

How are such chemical, or hormonal, means of information transmission
used in animals? What do some animals, for instance squirrels,
experience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to
prepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated
activities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many
different tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together
in these actions. However, the two alternate activities, fighting or running,
are also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common
preparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations
should ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How
would this be achieved?
If the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses
via nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming
activity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to
be sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-
ranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human
beings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the
adrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.
Adrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different
parts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it
acts include the heart. As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in
supply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system
and skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries
in these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The
breathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the
diaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the
animal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones
are part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control
and coordination in our body.

Remember that plants have hormones that control their directional
growth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,
we cannot imagine their role in directional growth. We have never seen
an animal growing more in one direction or the other, depending on
light or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident
that, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.
Plants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.
But we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully
maintained even during the growth of children.

Let us examine some examples to understand how hormones help
in coordinated growth. We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised
salt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised
salt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make
thyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat
metabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.
Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient
in our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One
of the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate
this with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 6.7?
Sometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs)
or extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens?
Growth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As
its name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development
of the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it
leads to dwarfism.
You must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance
as well as that of your friends as you approached 10–12 years of age.
These changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of
testosterone in males and oestrogen in females.
Do you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised
by the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering
from diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin.
This is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in
regulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts,
the sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.

Do You Know?
Hypothalamus plays
an important role in
the release of many
hormones. For
example, when the
level of growth
hormone is low, the
hypothalamus
releases growth
hormone releasing
factor which
stimulates the
pituitary gland to
release growth
hormone.

Control and Coordination
111
If it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise
quantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing
and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms.
For example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the
cells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the
blood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.

You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction
has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to
these questions.

Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in
oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a
chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a
shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a
word-equation.
The word-equation for the above reaction would be –
Magnesium + Oxygen
→Magnesium oxide
(1.1)
            (Reactants)
(Product)
The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),
magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is
magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.
A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an
arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand
side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are
written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.
The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of
the reaction.
You must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a
dazzling white flame and changes into a white powder. This powder is
magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium
and oxygen present in the air.

1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation
Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?
Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use
chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a
chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and
magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –
Mg + O2  →  MgO
(1.2)
Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the
LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the
same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,
then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on
both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal
chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical
equation for the burning of magnesium in air.
1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations
Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass
can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the
total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction
has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.
In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the
same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a
skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us
learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.
The word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –
Zinc + Sulphuric acid  →  Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen
The above word-equation may be represented by the following
chemical equation –
Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2
(1.3)
Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both
sides of the arrow.

As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of
the arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.
Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –
Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2
(1.4)
Reprint 2025-26

Step I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each
formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the
equation.
Fe   +   H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   H2
(1.5)
Step II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the
unbalanced equation (1.5).
Element

Number of atoms

To equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we
cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the
reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient
‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation
becomes –
Fe   +   4 H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   H2
Step IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements
to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced
equation.
To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules
of hydrogen as four on the RHS.
Step III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound
that contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a
product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum
number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element
oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on
the LHS.
To balance the oxygen atoms –

To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.
3   Fe   +   4   H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   4   H2
(1.8)
Step VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we
count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.
3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2
The numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are
equal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical
equations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance
the equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.
Step VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States
Writing Symbols of Physical States
Writing Symbols of Physical States
Writing Symbols of Physical States
Writing Symbols of Physical States  Carefully examine
the above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about
the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has
been given in this equation about their physical states.
To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states
of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical
formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants
and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),
respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product
is present as a solution in water.
The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes
3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)  → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)
(1.10)
Note that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this
reaction water is used in the form of steam.
Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless
it is necessary to specify them.
Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,
catalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow
in the equation. For example –

In simple language we can say that when two or more substances
(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions
are called combination reactions.
In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved.
This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is
released along with the formation of products are called exothermic
chemical reactions.

Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?
We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy
from the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler
substances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain
carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.
This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides
energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of
which you will study in Chapter 6.

In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down
to give simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous
sulphate crystals (FeSO4. 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour
of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe2O3),
sulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid,
while SO2 and SO3 are gases.
Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon
dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in
various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has
many uses – one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition
reaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.

1.3.1 Corrosion
You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get
coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process
is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get
tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating
formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances
around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this
process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green
coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.
Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships
and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of
iron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is
spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in
Chapter 3.
1.3.2 Rancidity
Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left
for a long time?
When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell
and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation
(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food
in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that
chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as
nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?

CHAPTER
Y
ou have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter
tastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them.
If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after
overeating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon
juice, vinegar or baking soda solution?
n Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy?
Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of
acids and bases to nullify each other’s effect.
n Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting
them.
You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour
of blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of
the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another
such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth
becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed
on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of
water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and
phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.
In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how
acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting
things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.
Do You Know?
Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to
the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus
solution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural
materials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as
Hydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a
solution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.

Now write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since

The bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct
electricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric
current through the solution. The electric current is carried through the
acidic solution by ions.
Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3
– in
HNO3, SO2–

 in H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in
acids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in
solution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.

This experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced
in the presence of water. The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules
cannot occur in the absence of water.
HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–
Hydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining
with water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as
H+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).
H+ + H2O → H3O+
We have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see

Bases generate hydroxide (OH–) ions in water. Bases which are soluble
in water are called alkalis.
Do You
Know?
All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They
are soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may
cause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?
Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all
bases generate OH

follows –
Acid + Base → Salt + Water
H  X + M  OH → MX + HOH
H+(aq) + OH

The process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly
exothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric
acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly
to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,
the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.
The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look
out for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated
sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.
Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the
concentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is
called dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?
We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between
an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about
dilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.
Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?
Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?
We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a
mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different
colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.
A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called
pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,
meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from
0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a
number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher
the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.
The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale
represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it
represents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,
increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated
with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.

The strength of acids and bases depends on the number of H+ ions
and OH– ions produced, respectively. If we take hydrochloric acid and
acetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar, then these produce
different amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H+ ions
are said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H+ ions are said to be
weak acids. Can you now say what weak and strong bases are?

Our body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can
survive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is
less than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it
lowers the pH of the river water. The survival of aquatic life in such rivers

pH in our digestive system
It is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric
acid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.
During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes
pain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called
antacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the
beginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.
Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for
this purpose.
pH change as the cause of tooth decay
Tooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth
enamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium
phosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in
water, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria
present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food
particles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent
this is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are
generally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and
prevent tooth decay.
Self defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare
Have you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid
which  causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda
on the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject
methanoic acid causing burning pain.

2.4.3 Chemicals from Common Salt
By now you have learnt that the salt formed
by the combination of hydrochloric acid and
sodium hydroxide solution is called sodium
chloride. This is the salt that you use in food.
You must have observed in the above Activity
that it is a neutral salt.
Seawater contains many salts dissolved
in it. Sodium chloride is separated from these
salts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in
several parts of the world. These large crystals
are often brown due to impurities. This is
called rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed
when seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt
is mined like coal.
You must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did
you know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our
struggle for freedom?

Common salt — A raw material for chemicals
The common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various
materials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing
soda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance
is used for making all these different substances.
Sodium hydroxide
When electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium
chloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The
process is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–
chlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.
2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) ® 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)
Chlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.
Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three
products produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the
different uses of these products.
Bleaching powder
You have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the
electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used
for the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced
by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder
is represented as Ca(ClO)2, though the actual composition is quite
complex.
2Ca(OH)2 + 2Cl2 ® Ca(ClO)2 + CaCl2 + 2H2O

Bleaching powder is used –
(i)
for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching
wood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes
in laundry;
(ii)
as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and
(iii)
to make drinking water free from germs.
Baking soda
The baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy
pakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical
name of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3). It is
produced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.

Sodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.
Uses of Baking soda
(i)
For making baking powder, which is a mixture of baking soda
(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as
tartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water,
the following reaction takes place –
NaHCO3 + H+      →     CO2 + H2O + Sodium salt of acid
         (From any acid)
Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or
cake to rise making them soft and spongy.
(ii)
Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.
Being alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and
provides relief.
(iii)
It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.
Washing soda
Another chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is
Na2CO3.10H2O (washing soda). You have seen above that sodium
carbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of
sodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basic salt.

Removing water
of crystallisation
Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of
crystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the
salt turns white.
If you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue
colour of the crystals reappears.
Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present
in one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one
formula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper
sulphate is Cu SO4. 5H2O. Now you would be able to answer the question
whether the molecule of Na2CO3.10H2O is wet.
One other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum.
It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical
formula CaSO4.2H2O. Let us look into the use of this salt.

The National Curriculum Framework, (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at
school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure
from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes
a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt
to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction
of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education
(1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative
activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key
reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity
and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,
not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.
The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a
source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The
textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to
opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and
activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates
the hard work done by the textbook development team responsible for this book. We
wish to thank the Chairman of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor
J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Rupamanjari Ghosh, School
of Physical Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, for guiding the work of
this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we
are grateful to them and their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOK
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load
on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing
the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with
creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the
exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes
already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into
consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•
Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the
same class
•
Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject
•
Difficulty level
•
Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through
self-learning or peer-learning
•
Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

This textbook of Science for Class X is a continuation of our attempt in the Class IX
Science textbook to comply with the guidelines of the National Curriculum
Framework-2005. We had to work within a limited time frame and also had our own
constraints coming in the way of this radical change. The revised and re-structured
syllabus for Class X covers selected topics in the broad themes of — Materials,
The World of the Living, How Things Work, Natural Phenomena and Natural Resources.
We have interpreted the syllabus to present a coherent coverage of scientific concepts
related to our daily life on the select topics. It is an integrated approach to science at
this level, with no sharp divisions into disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology
and Environmental Science.
There has been a conscious attempt to address the relevant social concerns in this
science textbook wherever possible — the concerns for people with special needs, the
issues of gender discrimination, energy and environment have found their natural
place in this book. Students have been encouraged to get into the debates on some of
the management concerns (for sustainable development, for example) so that they
can arrive at their own decisions after a scientific analysis of all the facts.
This book has some features which are meant to enhance its effectiveness. The
theme of each chapter has been introduced with examples from daily life, and if possible,
by a relevant activity that the students have to perform. The entire approach of the
book  is, in fact, activity-based, i.e., the students are required to construct knowledge
themselves from these activities. The emphasis is not on definitions and technical
terms, but on the concepts involved. Special care has been taken so that the rigour of
science is not lost while simplifying the language. Difficult and challenging ideas,
which are not to be covered at this stage, have often been placed as extra material in
the boxes in light orange. The excitement of doing science comes from pursuing the
unknown — the students would have the opportunity to think and explore somewhat
beyond the syllabus and may feel the urge to continue their scientific expedition at
higher levels. All such box items, including brief biography of scientists, are, of course,
non-evaluative.
Solved examples are provided, wherever felt necessary, to clarify a concept. The
in-text questions after a main section are for the students to check their understanding
of the topic. At the end of each chapter, there is a quick review of the important points
covered in the chapter. We have introduced some multiple choice questions in the
exercises. There are problems of different difficulty levels answers to the multiple-
choice questions and numericals, and hints for the difficult questions are included at
the end of the book.

lectricity has an important place in modern society. It is a controllable
and convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,
hospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does
it flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate
the current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt
to answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of
electric current and its applications.
11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT
11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT
11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT
11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT
11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT
We are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing
water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge
flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we
say that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we
know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide
flow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We
have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What
does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and
the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an
electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the
torch is turned off ), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.
How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by
the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In
other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using
metallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons
were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first
observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive
charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the
direction of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the
direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the
flow of electrons, which are negative charges.

The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to
the charge contained in nearly 6 × 1018 electrons. (We know that an
electron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 × 10–19 C.) The electric
current is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the
French scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836). One ampere is
constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,
1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere
(1 mA = 10–3 A) or in microampere (1 µA = 10–6 A).
An instrument called ammeter measures electric
current in a circuit. It is always connected in series
in a circuit through which the current is to be
measured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic
diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a
cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key.
Note that the electric current flows in the circuit
from the positive terminal of the cell to the negative
terminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.

11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE
What makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of
flow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as
water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube
is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a
pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of
the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic
wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only
if there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –
along the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a
battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within
a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,
even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a
conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in
motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to
maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its
chemical energy stored in it.
We define the electric potential difference between two points in an
electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit
charge from one point to the other –
Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)
V
=
W/Q
(11.2)
The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after
Alessandro Volta (1745 –1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the
potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor
when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one
point to the other.
Therefore, 1 volt = 
1 joule
1 coulomb
(11.3)
1 V  = 1 J C–1
The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called
the voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the
points between which the potential difference is to be measured.
Example 11.2
How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points
having a potential difference 12 V?
Solution
The amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential
difference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in
moving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is

Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 – 5 A range), a plug
key and some connecting wires.
n
Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter
leaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.
In this Activity, you will find that approximately the
same value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I
graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of
the graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant
ratio.
In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm
(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current
I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference
across its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the
ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly
proportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its
temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In
other words –
V ∝ I
(11.4)
or
V/I
=
constant
=
R
or
V
=
IR
(11.5)
In Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire
at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the
property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges  through it. Its SI
unit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω. According to Ohm’s law,
R = V/I
(11.6)
If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V
and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor
is 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm = 
1 volt
1 ampere
Also from Eq. (11.5) we get
I = V/R
(11.7)
It is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is
inversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the
current gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase
or decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to
regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable
resistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to
change the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical
resistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.

In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different
components. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path
for the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know
that motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric
current. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a
conductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among
which they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is
retarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low
resistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable
resistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a
higher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers
even higher resistance.

It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when
the length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when
a thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the
circuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different
material of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.
On applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the
resistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of
cross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements
have shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly
proportional to its length (l) and inversely proportional to the area of
cross-section (A). That is,
R ∝ l
(11.8)
and
R ∝ 1/A

good conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have
resistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 Ω m. Both the resistance and
resistivity of a material vary with temperature.
Table 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher
than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily
at high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in
electrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used
almost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and
aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.

Example 11.3
(a) How much current will an electric bulb draw from a 220 V source,
if the resistance of the bulb filament is 1200 Ω? (b) How much
current will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if
the resistance of the heater coil is 100 Ω?
Solution
(a) We are given V = 220 V; R = 1200 Ω.
From Eq. (12.6), we have the current I = 220 V/1200 Ω = 0.18 A.
(b) We are given, V = 220 V, R = 100 Ω.
From Eq. (11.6), we have the current I = 220 V/100 Ω = 2.2 A.

heater from the same 220 V source!

Example 11.5
Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 Ω at 20°C. If the
diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the
metal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material
of the wire.
Solution
We are given the resistance R of the wire = 26 Ω, the diameter
d = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10-4 m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m.
Therefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is
ρ
=  (RA/l)  =  (Rπd2/4l )
Substitution of values in this gives
ρ
=  1.84 × 10–6 Ω m
The resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 × 10–6 Ω m. From
Table 11.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese.

In preceding sections, we learnt about some simple electric circuits. We
have noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its
resistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical
gadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore
intend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.
There are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 11.6
shows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R1,
R2 and R3, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said
to be connected in series.

n
Similarly, measure the potential difference across the other two
resistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V3, respectively.
n
Deduce a relationship between V, V1, V2 and V3.
You will observe that the potential difference V is equal to the sum of
potential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential difference
across a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential
difference across the individual resistors. That is,
V = V1 + V2  + V3
(11.11)
In the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let I be the current through
the circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. It is possible to
replace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor
of resistance R, such that the potential difference V across it, and the
current I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s law
to the entire circuit, we have
V = I R
(11.12)
Reprint 2025-26

On applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors separately, we further
have
V1 = I R1
[11.13(a)]
V2 = I R2
[11.13(b)]
and
V3 = I R3
[11.13(c)]
From Eq. (11.11),
I R = I R1 + I R2 + I R3
or
Rs = R1 +R2 + R3
(11.14)
We can conclude that when several resistors are joined in series, the
resistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual
resistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.
Example 11.7
An electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω, and a conductor of 4 Ω
resistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the
total resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c)
the potential difference across the electric lamp and conductor.
Solution
The resistance of electric lamp, R1 = 20 Ω,
The resistance of the conductor connected in series, R2 = 4 Ω.
Then the total resistance in the circuit
R
= R1 + R2
Rs
= 20 Ω + 4 Ω = 24 Ω.
The total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery
V = 6 V.
Now by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given by

Applying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately,
we get potential difference across the electric lamp,
V1 = 20 Ω × 0.25 A
= 5 V;
and,
that across the conductor, V2  =  4 Ω × 0.25 A
         =  1 V.
Suppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric
lamp and conductor by a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistance
must be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery
terminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance
R of this equivalent resistor would be
R

This is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum

Similarly, measure the currents through R2 and R3. Let these be I2 and I3, respectively.
What is the relationship between I, I1, I2 and I3?
It is observed that the total current I, is equal to the sum of the
separate currents through each branch of the combination.
I = I1 + I2 + I3
(11.15)
Let Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of
resistors. By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,
we have
I = V/Rp
(11.16)
On applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we have
I1 = V /R1;    I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3
(11.17)
From Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have
  V/Rp = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3
or
  1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3
(11.18)
Thus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance
of a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the
reciprocals of the individual resistances.
Example 11.8
In the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R1,
R2 and R3 have the values 5 Ω, 10 Ω, 30 Ω, respectively, which have

each resistor, (b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the total circuit
resistance.
Solution
R1 = 5 Ω, R2 = 10 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω.
Potential difference across the battery, V = 12 V.
This is also the potential difference across each of the individual
resistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use
Ohm’s law.

Solution
Suppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an
equivalent resistor of resistance, R′. Similarly we replace
the parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single

1/ R′ = 1/10 + 1/40
= 5/40; that is R′  = 8 Ω.
Similarly,
1/ R″
= 1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;
that is, R″  = 10 Ω.
Thus, the total resistance, R = R′ + R″ = 18 Ω.
To calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get
 I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.
We have seen that in a series circuit the current is constant
throughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to
connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they
need currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example
11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one
component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.
If you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on
marriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending
lot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has
to be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel
circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total
resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is
helpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and
requires different current to operate properly.

TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT
TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT
We know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The
chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between
its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current
through a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We
have also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source
has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of
the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into
useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the
source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of
gadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric
fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other
hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of
resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets
dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating
effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric
heater, electric iron etc.
Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let
the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during
which a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q
through a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply
energy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the
source is
P
V
VI
=
Q
t =
(11.19)
Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P × t,
that is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This
energy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady
current I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is
H = VIt

Applying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get
H = I2 Rt
(11.21)
This is known as Joule’s law of heating. The
law implies that heat produced in a resistor is
(i) directly proportional to the square of current
for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to
resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly
proportional to the time for which the current flows
through the resistor. In practical situations, when
an electric appliance is connected to a known
voltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after
calculating the current through it, using the
relation I = V/R.
Example 11.10
An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is
at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.
The voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in each
case?
Solution
From Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is
P = V I
Thus the current I = P/V
(a)
When heating is at the maximum rate,
I = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;
and the resistance of the electric iron is
R = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.
(b)
When heating is at the minimum rate,
I = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;
and the resistance of the electric iron is
R = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω.
Example 11.11
100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω resistance. Find the
potential difference across the resistor.
Solution
H = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 s, V = ?
From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as
I
=
√(H/Rt)
=
√[100 J/(4 Ω × 1 s)]
=
5 A
Thus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (11.5)] is

11.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of
Electric Current
The generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of
electric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful
electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating
can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.
However, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.
The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle
and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s
heating.
The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric
bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is
possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such
high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as
tungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The
filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using
insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically
inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of
the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part
of it is in the form of light radiated.
Another common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in
electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow
of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with
the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of
appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead
etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,
the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and
breaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of
porcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic
purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron
which consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current
of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A
fuse must be used.

11.8 ELECTRIC POWER
11.8 ELECTRIC POWER
11.8 ELECTRIC POWER
You have studied in your earlier Class that the rate of doing work is
power. This is also the rate of consumption of energy.
Equation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated
or consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power.
The power P is given by
P  =  VI
Or
P  =  I2R = V2/R
(11.22)
The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by
a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference
of 1 V. Thus,
       1 W  =  1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 V A
(11.23)
The unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a
much larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical
energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,
therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when
1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy
is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.
1 kW h = 1000 watt × 3600 second
= 3.6 × 106 watt second
= 3.6 × 106 joule (J)

Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong!
We pay the electricity board or electric company to provide energy to move electrons
through the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines. We pay for the energy
that we use.

We see that the needle is deflected. What does it mean?  It means that
the electric current through the copper wire has produced a magnetic
effect. Thus we can say that electricity and magnetism are linked to each
other. Then, what about the reverse possibility of an electric effect of
moving magnets? In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such
electromagnetic effects. We shall also study about electromagnets which
involve the magnetic effect of electric current.
Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)
Hans Christian Oersted, one of the leading scientists of the 19th
century, played a crucial role in understanding electromagnetism. In
1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected
when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.
Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and
magnetism were related phenomena. His research later created
technologies such as the radio, television and fiber optics. The unit of
magnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.

surrounding it.  Therefore the iron filings experience a force.  The force
thus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region
surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,
is said to have a magnetic field.  The lines along which the iron filings

Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.
The direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a
north pole of the compass needle moves inside it.  Therefore it is taken
by convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at
the south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).
Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its
north pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.
The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of
closeness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting
on the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are
crowded (see Fig. 12.4).
No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would
mean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point
towards two directions, which is not possible.

What happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a
given point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary
the current in the wire. We find that the deflection in the needle also
changes. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.
It indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given
point increases as the current through the wire increases.
What happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved
away from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the
same? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the
conducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see
that the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field
produced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance
from it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentric
circles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight
wire become larger and larger as we move away from it.
12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule
A convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated
with a current-carrying conductor is given in Fig. 12.7.
n
Connect the copper wire vertically between the
points X and Y, as shown in Fig. 12.6 (a), in
series with the battery, a plug and key.
n
Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the
cardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this
purpose.)
n
Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed
position and note the current through the
ammeter.
n
Close the key so that a current flows through
the wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed
between the points X and Y remains vertically
straight.
n
Gently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe
the pattern of the iron filings. You would find
that the iron filings align themselves showing
a pattern of concentric circles around the
copper wire (Fig. 12.6).
n
What do these concentric circles represent?
They represent the magnetic field lines.
n
How can the direction of the magnetic field be
found? Place a compass at a point (say P) over
a circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The
direction of the north pole of the compass
needle would give the direction of the field lines
produced by the electric current through the
straight wire at point P. Show the direction by
an arrow.
n
Does the direction of magnetic field lines get
reversed if the direction of current through the
straight copper wire is reversed? Check it.

Imagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight
conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards
the direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the
conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as
shown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*.
Example 12.1
A current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west
direction. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly
below it and at a point directly above it?
Solution
The current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand
thumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or
above the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,
when viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed
from the west end.

* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a
corkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of
corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.
12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a
Circular Loop
We have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines
produced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose
this straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a
current is passed through it. How would the magnetic field
lines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced
by a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the
distance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying
circular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic
field around it would become larger and larger as we move
away from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the
centre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would
appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying
current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as
straight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right
hand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire
contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction
within the loop.

We know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying
wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.
Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is
n times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the
current in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to
each turn then just adds up.

12.2.4 Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid
A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped
closely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The pattern
of the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is
shown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the
magnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look
similar? Yes, they are similar. In fact, one end of the solenoid
behaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the
south pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of
parallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is
the same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is
uniform inside the solenoid.
A strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be
used to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,
when placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is
called an electromagnet.

We have learnt that an electric current flowing through a conductor
produces a magnetic field. The field so produced exerts a force on a
magnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor. French scientist Andre
Marie Ampere (1775–1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert
an equal and opposite force on the current-carrying conductor. The force
due to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be
demonstrated through the following activity.

The displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a
force is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed
in a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also
reversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.
Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards by
interchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that
Reprint 2025-26
Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
203
the direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It
shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the
direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments
have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude
of the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles
to the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a
simple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.
In Activity 12.7, we considered the
direction of the current and that of the magnetic
field perpendicular to each other and found
that the force is perpendicular to both of them.
The three directions can be illustrated through
a simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.
According to this rule, stretch the thumb,
forefinger and middle finger of your left hand
such that they are mutually perpendicular
(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the
direction of magnetic field and the second
finger in the direction of current, then the
thumb will point in the direction of motion or
the force acting on the conductor.
Devices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields
include electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones
and measuring instruments.
Example 12.2
An electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown
in Fig. 12.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be
(a)
to the right.
(b)
to the left.
(c)
out of the page.
(d)

Solution
Answer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the
direction of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand
rule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction
of motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.

12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
In our homes, we receive supply of electric power through a main supply
(also called mains), either supported through overhead electric poles or
by underground cables. One of the wires in this supply, usually with
red insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with
black insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the
potential difference between the two is 220 V.
At the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity
meter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected
to the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate
circuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of
15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as
geysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for
bulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is
usually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.
This is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that
have a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,
refrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which
provides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it
ensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance
keeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe
electric shock.

Magnetism in medicine
An electric current always produces a magnetic field. Even weak ion currents that
travel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch
something, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This
impulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are
about one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human
body where the magnetic field produced is significant, are the heart and the brain. The
magnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body
parts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis
of these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses
in medicine.

Figure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common
domestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be
connected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a
separate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order
that each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected
parallel to each other.
Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We
have already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous
chapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the
appliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur
when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This
occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the
appliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly
increases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse
prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage
by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating
that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.
Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply
voltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many
appliances to a single socket.

All organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human
beings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other
and maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an
area together with the non-living constituents of the environment form
an ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components
comprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising
physical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.
For example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such
as grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;
and animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms
interact with each other and their growth, reproduction and other
activities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden
is an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.
These are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-
made (artificial) ecosystems.

is an example of a human-made ecosystem.
n
Can we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does
it have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds
or lakes in the same manner? Why or why not?
We have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped as
producers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in
which they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall
what we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by
us above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar
and starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the
Sun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria
which can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category
and are called the producers.
Organisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for
their sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,
either directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers
are the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,
carnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of
these categories of consumers?
n
Imagine the situation where you do not clean the  aquarium and
some fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what
happens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising
bacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste
products of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers
as they break-down the complex organic substances into simple
inorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once
more by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead
animals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment
of the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?

Trophic levels
13.1.1 Food Chains and Webs
In Activity 13.4 we have formed a series of organisms feeding
on one another. This series or organisms taking part at
various biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).
Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.
The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.
They fix up the solar energy and make it available for
heterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary
consumers come at the second, small carnivores or the
secondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or
the tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).
We know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us
energy to do work. Thus the interactions among various
components of the environment involves flow of energy from
one component of the system to another. As we have studied,
the autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and
convert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the
activities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes
to the heterotrophs and decomposers. However, as we saw in
the previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form
of energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to the
environment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow
of energy between various components of the environment
has been extensively studied and it has been found that –
n
The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about
1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it
into food energy.
n
When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal
of energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes
into digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth
and reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned
into its own body and made available for the next level of
consumers.
n
Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount
of organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next
level of consumers.
n
Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,
food chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss
of energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy
remains after four trophic levels.
n
There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower
trophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the
producers.
n
The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism
is generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in
turn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight
line food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching
lines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).

211
From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),
two things become clear. Firstly, the flow of
energy is unidirectional. The energy that is
captured by the autotrophs does not revert
back to the solar input and the energy which
passes to the herbivores does not come back
to autotrophs. As it moves progressively
through the various trophic levels it is no
longer available to the previous level.
Secondly, the energy available at each trophic
level gets diminished progressively due to loss
of energy at each level.
Another interesting aspect of food chain
is how unknowingly some harmful
chemicals enter our bodies through the food
chain. You have read in Class IX how water
gets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of
several pesticides and other chemicals to
protect our crops from diseases and pests.
These chemicals are either washed down into
the soil or into the water bodies. From the

As these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated
progressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top
level in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals
get accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological
magnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat
and rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts
of pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or

13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted
Ozone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O2,
which we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of
life. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However, at the higher levels of the
atmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface
of the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation

is highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin
cancer in human beings.
Ozone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV
radiation acting on oxygen (O2) molecule. The higher energy UV
radiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O)
atoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form
ozone as shown—

The amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in
the 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire
extinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at
1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies
to make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.

We have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat is
digested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why
the same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are
specific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down
of a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we
try to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics
will not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.
These materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and
pressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,
these persist for a long time.
Substances that are broken down by biological processes are said
to be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were
biodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner
are said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and
simply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various

CHAPTER
B
efore we discuss the mechanisms by which organisms reproduce,
let us ask a more basic question – why do organisms reproduce?
After all, reproduction is not necessary to maintain the life of an individual
organism, unlike the essential life processes such as nutrition,
respiration, or excretion. On the other hand, if an individual organism is
going to create more individuals, a lot of its energy will be spent in the
process. So why should an individual organism waste energy on a process
it does not need to stay alive? It would be interesting to discuss the
possible answers in the classroom!
Whatever the answer to this question, it is obvious that we notice
organisms because they reproduce. If there were to be only one, non-
reproducing member of a particular kind, it is doubtful that we would
have noticed its existence. It is the large numbers of organisms belonging
to a single species that bring them to our notice. How do we know that
two different individual organisms belong to the same species? Usually,
we say this because they look similar to each other. Thus, reproducing
organisms create new individuals that look very much like themselves.

Organisms look similar because their body designs are similar. If body
designs are to be similar, the blueprints for these designs should be
similar. Thus, reproduction at its most basic level will involve making
copies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the
chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance
of features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo
Nucleic Acid) molecules. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information
source for making proteins. If the information is changed, different
proteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered
body designs.
Therefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA
copy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This
creates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to
be separated from each other. However, keeping one copy of DNA in the
original cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,
Reprint 2025-26
Science
114
?
because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular
structure for maintaining life processes. Therefore, DNA copying is
accompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and
then the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus.
Effectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells.
These two cells are of course similar, but are they likely to be
absolutely identical? The answer to this question will depend on how
accurately the copying reactions involved occur. No bio-chemical reaction
is absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process
of copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the
DNA copies generated will be similar, but may not be identical to the
original. Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA
copy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits. Such a newborn
cell will simply die. On the other hand, there could still be many other
variations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic
outcome. Thus, the surviving cells are similar to, but subtly different
from each other. This inbuilt tendency for variation during reproduction
is the basis for evolution, as we will discuss in the next chapter.
7.1.1 The Importance of Variation
Populations of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the
ecosystem, using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA
copying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body
design features that allow the organism to use that particular niche.
Reproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species.
However, niches can change because of reasons beyond the control
of the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels
can vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If
a population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche
and if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped
out. However, if some variations were to be present in a few individuals
in these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive.
Thus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters,
and if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming,
most of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat
would survive and grow further. Variation is thus useful for the survival
of species over time.

let us now examine how different organisms actually reproduce. The
modes by which various organisms reproduce depend on the body
design of the organisms.
7.2.1 Fission
For unicellular organisms, cell division, or fission, leads to the creation
of new individuals. Many different patterns of fission have been observed.
Many bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during
cell division. In organisms such as Amoeba, the splitting of the two cells
during division can take place in any plane.

these structures. Other single-celled organisms, such as the malarial
parasite, Plasmodium, divide into many daughter cells simultaneously
by multiple fission.
Yeast, on the other hand, can put out small buds that separate and
grow further, as we saw in Activity 7.1.

n
Can you identify different tissues in the Spirogyra filaments?
In multi-cellular organisms with relatively simple body organisation,
simple reproductive methods can still work. Spirogyra, for example,
simply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or
fragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for
this, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?
This is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply
divide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as
we have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised
cells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,
which then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such a
carefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.
Multi-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of
reproduction.
A basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different
cell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general
pattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific
cell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if
the organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there
must be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,
proliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.
7.2.3 Regeneration
Many fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new
individual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is
somehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow
into separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra and
Planaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows
into a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).
Regeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate
and make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells
undergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes

However,
regeneration is not the same
as reproduction, since most
organisms 
would 
not
normally depend on being cut
up to be able to reproduce.
7.2.4 Budding
Organisms such as Hydra
use regenerative cells for
reproduction in the process of
budding. In Hydra, a bud
develops as an outgrowth due
to repeated cell division at one
specific site (Fig. 7.4). These buds develop into tiny individuals and when
fully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent
individuals.

7.2.5 Vegetative Propagation
There are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves
develop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most
animals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This
property of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering
or grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for
agricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear
flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods
also make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,
rose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another
advantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are
genetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its
characteristics.

Tissue culture
In tissue culture, new plants are grown by removing tissue or separating cells from
the growing tip of a plant. The cells are then placed in an artificial medium where they
divide rapidly to form a small group of cells or callus. The callus is transferred to
another medium containing hormones for growth and differentiation. The plantlets
are then placed in the soil so that they can grow into mature plants. Using tissue
culture, many plants can be grown from one parent in disease-free conditions. This
technique is commonly used for ornamental plants.
7.2.6 Spore Formation
Even in many simple multi-cellular organisms, specific reproductive
parts can be identified. The thread-like structures that developed on
the bread in Activity 7.2 above are the hyphae of the bread mould
(Rhizopus). They are not reproductive parts. On the other hand, the
tiny blob-on-a-stick structures are involved in reproduction. The
blobs are sporangia, which contain cells, or spores, that can
eventually develop into new Rhizopus individuals (Fig. 7.6). The spores
are covered by thick walls that protect them until they come into
contact with another moist surface and can begin to grow.

We are also familiar with modes of reproduction that depend on the
involvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created.
Bulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce
new chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to
produce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode
of reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of
reproduction, which we have been discussing above?
7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?
The creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as
well as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we
have noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are
a source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual
organism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,
variations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would
therefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes
that allowed more and more variation to be generated.
While DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they
are precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow
process. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many
of the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular
apparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants
be speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already
has variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two
different individuals in a population would have quite different patterns
of accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living
individuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.
Combining variations from two or more individuals would thus create
new combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since
it would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of
Reprint 2025-26

reproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two
different individuals during reproduction.
But this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the
combination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then
each new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that
the previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the
cellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for
solving this difficulty?
We have seen earlier that as organisms become more complex, the
specialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular
organisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special
lineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of
chromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-
reproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division
called meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine
during sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-
establishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in
the new generation.
If the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has
highly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores
of energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two
germ-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar.
But as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also
specialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the
other is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-
cell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored
food is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections
how the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to
differences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some
cases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.
7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants
The reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower. You
have already studied the different parts of a flower – sepals, petals,
stamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are
the reproductive parts of a flower which
contain the germ-cells. What possible
functions could the petals and sepals serve?
The flower may be unisexual (papaya,
watermelon) when it contains either stamens
or pistil or bisexual (Hibiscus, mustard)
when it contains both stamens and pistil.
Stamen is the male reproductive part and it
produces pollen grains that are yellowish
in colour. You must have seen this yellowish
powder that often sticks to our hands if we
touch the stamen of a flower. Pistil is present
in the centre of a flower and is the female
reproductive part. It is made of three parts.

Germination of pollen on
stigma
The swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated part is the style
and the terminal part which may be sticky is the stigma. The ovary
contains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell
produced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in
the ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the
zygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.
Thus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the
stigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower, it is
referred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is
transferred from one flower to another, it is known as cross-
pollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is
achieved by agents like wind, water or animals.
After the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the
female germ-cells which are in the ovary. For this, a tube grows
out of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the
ovary.
After fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an
embryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is
gradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens
to form a fruit. Meanwhile, the petals, sepals, stamens, style and
stigma may shrivel and fall off. Have you ever observed any flower
part still persisting in the fruit? Try and work out the advantages
of seed-formation for the plant. The seed contains the future plant
or embryo which develops into a seedling under appropriate
conditions. This process is known as germination.

7.3.3 Reproduction in Human Beings
So far, we have been discussing the variety of modes that different species
use for reproduction. Let us now look at the species that we are most
interested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of
reproduction. How does this process work?
Let us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that
our bodies change as we become older. You have learnt changes that
take place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. We notice that our
height has increased continuously from early age till now. We acquire
teeth, we even lose the old, so-called milk teeth and acquire new ones.

All of these are changes that can be grouped under the general process
of growth, in which the body becomes larger. But in early teenage years,
a whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as
body enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.
Proportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations.
Some of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin
to notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits
and the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker
in colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on
the face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop
pimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies
and those of others in new ways.
On the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are
different between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,
with darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,
girls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new
thick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further,
the penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in
daydreams or at night.
All of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and
years. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do
they happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and
quickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does
not become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the
face in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does
the growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show
differences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or
fingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and
shape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual
maturation of the body.
Why does the body show sexual maturation at this age? We have
talked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies
to carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate
in sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen
that plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human
beings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the
body of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources
of the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is
happening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be
a major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow
down, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during
adolescence is called puberty.
So how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the
reproductive process? We must remember that the sexual mode of
reproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join
together. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the
bodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen
by two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of
germ-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to

participate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must
be identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such
as new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking
place.
On the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two
people needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it
is capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is
carried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed
later. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to
accommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in
the process of sexual reproduction.
7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System
The male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)
consists of portions which produce the
germ-cells and other portions that deliver
the germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.
The formation of germ-cells or sperms
takes place in the testes. These are located
outside the abdominal cavity in scrotum
because sperm formation requires a lower
temperature than the normal body
temperature. We have discussed the role of the
testes in the secretion of the hormone,
testosterone, in the previous chapter. In
addition to regulating the formation of sperms,
testosterone brings about changes in
appearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.
The sperms formed are delivered
through the vas deferens which unites with
a tube coming from the urinary bladder. The
urethra thus forms a common passage for
both the sperms and urine. Along the path
of the vas deferens, glands like the prostate
and the seminal vesicles add their secretions
so that the sperms are now in a fluid which
makes their transport easier and this fluid
also provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny
bodies that consist of mainly genetic
material and a long tail that helps them to
move towards the female germ-cell.
7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System
The female germ-cells or eggs are made in
the ovaries. They are also responsible for the
production of some hormones. Look at
Fig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in
the female reproductive system.

When a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of
immature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One
egg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried
from the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.
The two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the
uterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.
The sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual
intercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may
encounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a
ball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus
where they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We
have seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to
undertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself
every month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining
thickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.
The embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a
special tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the
uterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the
mother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides
a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to
the embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances
which can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood
through the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s
body takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of
rhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.
7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not Fertilised?
If the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary
releases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month
to receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.
This would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had
taken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the
lining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and
mucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as
menstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.
7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health
As we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes
place while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree
of sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the
mind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.
How do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major
responsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures
about these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for
participating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There
can be pressure from families to get married and start having children.
There can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having
children. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.

We must also consider the possible health consequences of having
sex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted
from person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a
very intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many
diseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections
such as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts
and HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases
during the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis
during sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to
some extent.
The sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.
Pregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the
woman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely
affected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.
These contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One
category is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not
reach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the
vagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts
by changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not
released and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need
to be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal
balances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices
such as the loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent
pregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the
uterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will
be prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will
not be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take
place. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While
surgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause
infections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can
also be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be
misused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in
illegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,
the female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless
female foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in
some sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has
been prohibited by law.
We have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which
organisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a
given population will determine its size. The size of the human population
is a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding
population makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living.
However, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of
living for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.
If we look around us, what can we identify as the most important
reason(s) for poor living standards?

these metals come from?
You have studied that the earth’s crust is
made up of different minerals embedded in the
rocks. Various metals are extracted from these
minerals after proper refinement.
Minerals are an indispensable part of our
lives. Almost everything we use, from a tiny pin
to a towering building or a big ship, all are
made from minerals. The railway lines and the
tarmac (paving) of the roads, our implements
and machinery too are made from minerals.
Cars, buses, trains, aeroplanes are

power resources derived from the earth. Even
the food that we eat contains minerals. In all
stages of development, human beings have
used minerals for their livelihood, decoration,
festivities, religious and ceremonial rites.

as

“homogenous, naturally occurring substance
with a definable internal structure.” Minerals
are found in varied forms in nature, ranging
from the hardest diamond to the softest talc.
Why are they so varied?
Reprint 2025-26
You have already learnt about rocks.
Rocks are combinations of homogenous
substances called minerals. Some rocks, for
instance limestone, consist of a single mineral
only, but majority of the rock consist of several
minerals in varying proportions. Although,
over 2000 minerals have been identified, only
a few are abundantly found in most of the
rocks.
A particular mineral that will be formed
from a certain combination of elements
depends upon the physical and chemical
conditions under which the material forms.
This, in turn, results in a wide range of colours,
hardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that
a particular mineral possesses. Geologists use
these properties to classify the minerals.
Study of Minerals by Geographers
and Geologists
Geographers study minerals as part of the
earth’s crust for a better understanding of
landforms. The distribution of mineral
resources and associated  economic activities
are of interest to geographers. A geologist,
however, is interested in the formation of
minerals, their age and physical and
chemical composition.
 However, for general and commercial
purposes minerals can be classified as under.
MODE OF OCCURRENCE OF MINERALS
Where are these minerals found?
Minerals are usually found in “ores”. The
term ore is used to describe an accumulation
of any mineral mixed with other elements.
The mineral content of the ore must be in
sufficient concentration to make its extraction
commercially viable. The type of formation or
structure in which they are found determines
the relative ease with which mineral ores may
be mined. This also determines the cost of
extraction. It is, therefore, important for us
to understand the main types of formations
in which minerals occur.
Minerals generally occur in these forms:
(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks
minerals may occur in the cracks,
crevices, faults or joints. The smaller
occurrences are called veins and the
larger are called lodes. In most cases,
they are formed when minerals in liquid/
molten and gaseous forms are forced
upward through cavities towards the
earth’s surface. They cool and solidify as
they rise. Major metallic minerals like tin,
copper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained
from veins and lodes.
(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals
occur in beds or layers. They have been
formed as a result of deposition,
accumulation and concentration in
horizontal strata. Coal and some forms of
iron ore have been concentrated as a result
of long periods under great heat and
pressure. Another group of sedimentary
minerals include gypsum, potash salt and
sodium salt. These are formed as a result
of evaporation especially in arid regions.
(iii) Another mode of formation involves the
decomposition of surface rocks, and the
removal of soluble constituents, leaving
a residual mass of weathered
material containing ores. Bauxite is
formed this way.

Dig a little deeper: What is the difference
between an open pit mine, a quarry and an

Rat-Hole Mining. Do you know that most
of the minerals in India are nationalised
and their extraction is possible only after
obtaining due permission from the
government? But in most of the tribal
areas of the north-east India, minerals are
owned by individuals or communities. In
Meghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,
iron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal
mining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done
by family member in the form of a long
narrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’
mining. The National Green Tribunal has
declared such activities illegal and
recommended that these should be
stopped forthwith.
(iv) Certain minerals may occur as alluvial
deposits in sands of valley floors and the
base of hills. These deposits are called
‘placer deposits’ and generally contain
minerals, which are not corroded by water.
Gold, silver, tin and platinum are most
important among such minerals.
(v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities
of minerals, but most of these are too widely
diffused to be of economic significance.
However, common salt, magnesium and
bromine are largely derived from ocean
waters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in
manganese nodules.
non-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains
of north India are almost devoid of economic
minerals. These variations exist largely because
of the differences in the geological structure,
processes and time involved in the formation
of minerals.
Let us now study the distribution of a few
major minerals in India. Always remember that
the concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease
of extraction and closeness to the market play
an important role in affecting the economic
viability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand,
a choice has to be made between a number of
possible options. When this is done a mineral
‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine.
Ferrous Minerals
Ferrous minerals account for about three-
fourths of the total value of the production of
metallic minerals. They provide a strong base
for the development of metallurgical industries.
India exports substantial quantities of ferrous
minerals after meeting her internal demands.
Iron Ore
Iron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone
of industrial development. India is endowed
with fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India
is rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is
the finest iron ore with a very high content of
iron up to 70 per cent. It has excellent magnetic
qualities, especially valuable in the electrical
industry. Hematite ore is the most important
industrial iron ore in terms of the quantity
used, but has a slightly lower iron content than
magnetite. (50-60 per cent). In 2018–19 almost
entire production of iron ore (97%) accrued
from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and
Jharkhand. The remaining production (3%)
was from other states.
India is fortunate to have fairly rich and
varied mineral resources. However, these are
unevenly distributed. Broadly speaking,
peninsular rocks contain most of the reserves
of coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other
non-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on
the western and eastern flanks of the peninsula,
in Gujarat and Assam have most of the
petroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock
systems of the peninsula, has reserves of many

ferrous minerals is not very satisfactory.
However, these minerals, which include
copper, bauxite, lead, zinc and gold play a
vital role in a number of metallurgical,
engineering and electrical industries. Let us

Non-Metallic Minerals
Mica is a mineral made up of a series of plates
or leaves. It splits easily into thin sheets. These
sheets can be so thin that a thousand can be
layered into a mica sheet of a few centimeters
high. Mica can be clear, black, green, red yellow
or brown. Due to its excellent di-electric
strength, low power loss factor, insulating
properties and resistance to high voltage, mica
is one of the most indispensable minerals used
in electric and electronic industries.
Mica deposits are found in the northern
edge of the Chota Nagpur plateau. Koderma
Gaya – Hazaribagh belt of Jharkhand is the
leading producer.
In Rajasthan, the major mica producing
area is around Ajmer. Nellore mica belt of
Andhra Pradesh is also an important producer
in the country.
Rock Minerals
Limestone is found in association with rocks
composed of calcium carbonates or calcium
and magnesium carbonates. It is found in
sedimentary rocks of most geological
formations. Limestone is the basic raw
material for the cement industry and
essential for smelting iron ore in the blast
furnace.
Dig a little deeper: Study the maps to explain
why Chota Nagpur is a storehouse of minerals.
Hazards of Mining
Have you ever wondered about the efforts the miners make in making life comfortable
for you? What are the impacts of mining on
the health of the miners and the environment?
The dust and noxious fumes inhaled by
miners make them vulnerable to pulmonary
diseases. The risk of collapsing mine roofs,
inundation and fires in coalmines are a
constant threat to miners.
The water sources in the region get
contaminated due to mining. Dumping of waste
and slurry leads to degradation of land, soil,
and increase in stream and river pollution.

generation of dust in mining areas

Emperor Napoleon III wore buttons and

CONSERVATION OF MINERALS
We all appreciate the strong dependence of
industry and agriculture upon mineral
deposits and the substances manufactured
from them. The total volume of workable
mineral deposits is an insignificant fraction
i.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust. We are
rapidly consuming mineral resources that
required millions of years to be created and
concentrated. The geological processes of
mineral formation are so slow that the rates
of replenishment are infinitely small in
comparison to the present rates of
consumption. Mineral resources are,
therefore, finite and non-renewable. Rich
mineral deposits are our country’s extremely
valuable but short-lived possessions.
Continued extraction of ores leads to
increasing costs as mineral extraction comes
from greater depths along with decrease
in quality.
Reprint 2025-26

CONTEMPORARY INDIA – II
A concerted effort has to be made in order
to use our mineral resources in a planned
and sustainable manner. Improved
technologies need to be constantly evolved to
allow use of low grade ores at low costs.
Recycling of metals, using scrap metals and
other substitutes are steps in conserving our
mineral resources for the future.
Dig a little deeper: Make a list of items where
substitutes  are being used instead of minerals.
Where are these substitutes obtained from?
Energy Resources
Energy is required for all activities. It is needed
to cook, to provide light and heat, to propel
vehicles and to drive machinery in industries.
Energy can be generated from fuel
minerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas,
uranium and from electricity. Energy
resources can be classified as conventional
and non-conventional sources. Conventional
sources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,
coal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity
(both hydel and thermal). Non-conventional
sources include solar, wind, tidal, geothermal,
biogas and atomic energy. Firewood and cattle
dung cake are most common in rural India.
According to one estimate more than 70 per
cent energy requirement in rural households
is met by these two ; continuation of these is
increasingly becoming difficult due to
decreasing forest area. Moreover, using dung
cake too is being discouraged because it
consumes most valuable manure which could
be used in agriculture.
Conventional Sources of Energy
Coal: In India, coal is the most abundantly
available fossil fuel. It provides a substantial
part of the nation’s energy needs. It is used
for power generation, to supply energy to
industry as well as for domestic needs. India
is highly dependent on coal for meeting its
commercial energy requirements.
As you are already aware that coal is
formed due the compression of plant material
over millions of years. Coal, therefore, is
found in a variety of forms depending on the
degrees of compression and the depth and
time of burial. Decaying plants in swamps
produce peat. Which has a low carbon and
high moisture contents and low heating
capacity. Lignite is a low grade brown coal,
which is soft with high moisture content. The
principal lignite reserves are in Neyveli in Tamil
Nadu and are used for generation of
electricity. Coal that has been buried deep
and subjected to increased temperatures is
bituminous coal. It is the most popular coal
in commercial use. Metallurgical coal is high
grade bituminous coal which has a special
value for smelting iron in blast furnaces.
Anthracite is the highest quality hard coal.
In India coal occurs in rock series of two
main geological ages, namely Gondwana, a
little over 200 million years in age and in
tertiary deposits which are only about 55
million years old. The major resources of
Gondwana coal, which are metallurgical coal,
are located in Damodar valley (West Bengal-

Jharkhand). Jharia, Raniganj, Bokaro are
important coalfields. The Godavari,
Mahanadi, Son and Wardha valleys also
contain coal deposits.
Tertiary coals occur in the north eastern
states of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal
Pradesh and Nagaland.
Remember coal is a bulky material, which
loses weight on use as it is reduced to ash.
Hence, heavy industries and thermal power
stations are located on or near the coalfields.
Petroleum
Petroleum or mineral oil is the next major
energy source in India after coal. It provides
fuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for
machinery and raw materials for a number of
manufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries
act as a “nodal industry” for synthetic textile,
fertiliser and numerous chemical industries.
Most of the petroleum occurrences in India
are associated with anticlines and fault traps
in the rock formations of the tertiary age. In
regions of folding, anticlines or domes, it
occurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the
upfold. The oil bearing layer is a porous
limestone or sandstone through which oil may
flow. The oil is prevented from rising or
sinking by intervening non-porous layers.
Petroleum is also found in fault traps
between porous and non-porous rocks. Gas,
being lighter  usually occurs above the oil.
 Mumbai High, Gujarat and Assam are
major petroleum production areas in India.
From the map locate the 3 major off shore
fields of western India. Ankeleshwar is the
most important field of Gujarat. Assam is the
oldest oil producing state of India. Digboi,
Naharkatiya and Moran-Hugrijan are the
important oil fields in the state.
Natural Gas
Natural Gas is found with petroleum deposits
and is released when crude oil is brought to
the surface. It can be used as a domestic and
industrial fuel. It is used as fuel in power sector
to generate electricity, for heating purpose in
industries, as raw material in chemical,
petrochemical and fertilizer industries, as
transport fuel and as cooking fuel. With the
expansion of gas infrastructure and local city
gas distribution (COD) networks, natural gas
is also emerging as a preferred transport fuel
(CNG) and cooking fuel (PNG) at homes. India’s
major gas reserves are found in the Mumbai
High and allied fields along the west coast
which are supplemented by finds in the
Cambay basin. Along the East Coast, new
reserves of natural gas have been discovered
in the Krishna-Godavari basin.
The first 1,700 km long Hazira-Vijaipur-
Jagdishpur (HVJ) cross country gas pipeline,
constructed by GAIL (India), linked Mumbai
High and Bassein gas fields with various
fertilizer, power and industrial complexes in
western and northen India. This artery
provided impetus to Indian gas market
development. Overall, India’s gas infrastructure
has expanded over ten times from 1,700 km
to 18,500 km of cross-country pipelines and
is expected to soon reach over 34, 000 km as
Gas Grid by linking all gas sources and
consuming markets across the country
including North Eastern states.
Electricity
Electricity has such a wide range of
applications in today’s world that, its percapita
consumption is considered as an index of
development. Electricity is generated mainly in
two  ways: by running water which drives hydro
turbines to generate hydro electricity; and by
burning other fuels such as coal, petroleum
and natural gas to drive turbines to produce
thermal power. Once generated the electricity
is exactly the same.
Hydro electricity is generated by fast
flowing water, which is a renewable resource.
India has a number of multi-purpose projects
like the Bhakra Nangal, Damodar Valley
corporation, the Kopili Hydel Project etc.
producing hydroelectric power.
Thermal electricity is generated by using
coal, petroleum and natural gas. The thermal
power stations use non-renewable fossil fuels
for generating electricity.

Non-Conventional Sources of Energy
The growing consumption of energy has
resulted in the country becoming increasingly
dependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and
gas.  Rising prices of oil and gas and their
potential shortages have raised uncertainties
about the security of energy supply in future,
which in turn has serious repercussions on the
growth of the national economy. Moreover,
increasing use of fossil fuels also causes
serious environmental problems. Hence, there
is a pressing need to use renewable energy
sources like solar energy, wind, tide, biomass
and energy from waste material. These are
called non-conventional energy sources.
India is blessed with an abundance of
sunlight, water, wind and biomass. It has the
largest programmes for the development of
these renewable energy resources.
Nuclear or Atomic Energy
It is obtained by altering the structure of
atoms. When such an alteration is made, much
energy is released in the form of heat and this
is used to generate electric power. Uranium and
Thorium, which are available in Jharkhand and
the Aravalli ranges of Rajasthan are used for
generating atomic or nuclear power. The
Monazite sands of Kerala is also rich in
Thorium.
Locate the 6 nuclear power stations and find
out the state in which they are located.
Solar Energy
India is a tropical country. It has enormous
possibilities of tapping solar energy.
Photovoltaic technology converts sunlight
directly into electricity. Solar energy is fast
becoming popular in rural and remote areas.
Some big solar power plants are being
established in different parts of India which
will minimise the dependence of rural
households on firewood and dung cakes,
which in turn will contribute to environmental
conservation and adequate supply of manure
in agriculture.

Wind power
India has great potential of wind power. The
largest wind farm cluster is located in Tamil
Nadu from Nagarcoil to Madurai. Apart from
these, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat,
Kerala, Maharashtra and Lakshadweep have
important wind farms. Nagarcoil and
Jaisalmer are well known for effective use of
wind energy in the country.
Biogas
Shrubs, farm waste, animal and human waste
are used to produce biogas for domestic
consumption in rural areas. Decomposition
of organic matter yields gas, which has higher
thermal efficiency in comparison to kerosene,
dung cake and charcoal. Biogas plants are
set up at municipal, cooperative and
individual levels. The plants using cattle dung
are known as ‘Gobar gas plants’ in rural India.
These provide twin benefits to the farmer in

geothermal gradient is high, high temperatures
are found at shallow depths. Groundwater in
such areas absorbs heat from the rocks and
becomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to
the earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This
steam is used to drive turbines and generate
electricity.
There are several hundred hot springs in
India, which could be used to generate
electricity. Two experimental projects have been
set up in India to harness geothermal energy.
One is located in the Parvati valley near
Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh and the other
is located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh.
Conservation of Energy Resources
Energy is a basic requirement for economic
development.  Every sector of the national
economy – agriculture, industry, transport,
commercial and domestic – needs inputs of
energy. The economic development plans
implemented since Independence necessarily
required increasing amounts of energy to
remain operational.  As a result, consumption
of energy in all forms has been steadily rising
all over the country.
In this background, there is an urgent need
to develop a sustainable path of energy
development. Promotion of energy conservation
and increased use of renewable energy sources
are the twin planks of sustainable energy.
India is presently one of the least energy
efficient countries in the world. We have to
adopt a cautious approach for the judicious
use of our limited energy resources. For
example, as concerned citizens we can do our
bit by using public transport systems instead
of individual vehicles; switching off electricity
when not in use, using power-saving devices
and using non-conventional sources of energy.
After all, “energy saved is energy produced”.

Tidal Energy
Oceanic tides can be used to generate
electricity. Floodgate dams are built across
inlets. During high tide water flows into the

from iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?
Do you also know that some types of clothes

People employed in the secondary activities
manufacture the primary materials into
finished goods. The workers employed in steel
factories, car, breweries, textile industries,
bakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people
are employed in providing services. In this
chapter, we are mainly concerned with
manufacturing industries which fall in the
secondary sector.
The economic strength of a country is
measured 
by 
the 
development 
of
manufacturing industries.
IMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING
Manufacturing sector is considered the backbone
of development in general and economic
development in particular mainly because–
• Manufacturing industries not only help in
modernising agriculture, which forms the
backbone of our economy, they also reduce
the heavy dependence of people on
agricultural income by providing them jobs
in secondary and tertiary sectors.
• Industrial development is a precondition for
eradication of unemployment and poverty
from our country. This was the main
philosophy behind public sector industries
and joint sector ventures in India. It was also
aimed at bringing down regional disparities
by establishing industries in tribal and
backward areas.
• Export of manufactured goods expands
trade and commerce, and brings in much
needed foreign exchange.
• Countries that transform their raw
materials into a wide variety of finished
goods of higher value are prosperous.
India’s prosperity lies in increasing and
diversifying its manufacturing industries as
quickly as possible.
Agriculture and industry are not exclusive
of each other. They move hand in hand.  For
instance, the agro-industries in India have
given a major boost to agriculture by raising
its productivity. They depend on the latter for
raw materials and sell their products such as
irrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides,
pesticides, plastic and PVC pipes, machines
and tools, etc. to the farmers. Thus,

Classification of Industries
List the various manufactured products you
use in your daily life such as – transistors,
electric bulbs, vegetable oil, cement,
glassware, petrol, matches, scooters,
automobiles, medicines and so on. If we
classify the various industries based on a
particular criterion then we would be
able to understand their manufacturing
better.  Industries may be classified as
follows:
On the basis of source of raw materials
used:
• Agro based: cotton, woollen, jute, silk
textile, rubber and sugar, tea, coffee,
edible oil.
• Mineral based: iron and steel, cement,
aluminium, 
machine 
tools,
petrochemicals.
According to their main role:
• Basic or key industries are those which
supply their products as raw materials to
manufacture other goods e.g. iron and
steel and copper smelting, aluminum
smelting.
• Consumer industries that produce goods
for direct use by consumers – sugar,
toothpaste, paper, sewing machines,
fans etc.
On the basis of capital investment:
• A small scale industry is defined with
reference to the maximum investment
allowed on the assets of a unit. This limit
has changed over a period of time. At
present the maximum investment allowed
is rupees one crore.
On the basis of ownership:
• Public sector, owned and operated by
government agencies – BHEL, SAIL etc.
• Private sector industries owned and
operated by individuals or a group of
individuals –TISCO, Bajaj Auto Ltd.,
Dabur Industries.
• Joint sector industries which are jointly run
by the state and individuals or a group of
individuals. Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is jointly
owned by public and private sector.
• Cooperative sector industries are owned
and operated by the producers or
suppliers of raw materials, workers or
both.  They pool in the resources and share
the profits or losses proportionately. Such
examples are the sugar industry in
Maharashtra, the coir industry in Kerala.
Based on the bulk and weight of raw material
and finished goods:
• Heavy industries such as iron and steel
• Light industries that use light raw
materials and produce light goods such
as electrical goods industries.
Classify the following into two groups on the
basis of bulk and weight of raw material and
finished goods.
(i) Oil
(vi) Sewing Machines
(ii) Knitting needles
(vii) Shipbuilding
(iii) Brassware
(viii) Electric Bulbs
(iv) Fuse wires
(ix) Paint brushes
(v) Watches
(x) Automobiles
Agro-based Industries
Cotton, jute, silk, woollen textiles, sugar and
edible oil, etc. industries are  based on
agricultural raw materials.
manufacturing industry has not only
assisted agriculturists in increasing their
production but also made the production
processes very efficient.
In the present day world of globalisation,
our industry needs to be more efficient and
competitive. Self-sufficiency alone is not
enough. Our manufactured goods must be
at par in quality with those in the
international market. Only then, will we be
able to compete in the international market.

Textile Industry: The textile industry
occupies unique position in the Indian
economy, because it contributes significantly
to industrial production, employment
generation and foreign exchange earnings. It
is the only industry in the country, which is
self-reliant and complete in the value chain
i.e., from raw material to the highest value
added products.
Cotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton
textiles were produced with hand spinning
and handloom weaving techniques. After
the 18th century, power-looms came into
use.  Our traditional industries suffered a
setback during the colonial period because
they could not compete with the mill-made
cloth from England.
Fig. 6.1:  Value addition in the textile industry
In the early years, the cotton textile
industry was concentrated in the cotton
growing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Availability of raw cotton, market, transport
including accessible port facilities, labour,
moist climate, etc. contributed towards its
localisation.  This industry has close links
with agriculture and provides a living to
farmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers
engaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,
dyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and
sewing. The industry by creating demands
supports many other industries, such as,
chemicals and dyes, packaging materials
and engineering works.
While spinning continues to be centralised
in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,
weaving is highly decentralised to provide
scope for incorporating traditional skills and
designs of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,
embroidery, etc. India has world class
production in spinning, but weaving supplies
low quality of fabric as it cannot use much of
the high quality yarn produced in the country.
Weaving is done by handloom, powerloom and
in mills.
The handspun khadi provides large scale
employment to weavers in their homes as a
cottage industry.
Why did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on
spinning yarn and weaving khadi?
Why is it important for our country to
keep the mill sector loomage lower than
power loom and handloom?
Jute Textiles
India is the largest producer of raw jute and
jute goods and stands at second place as an
exporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are
located in West Bengal, mainly along the banks
of the Hugli river, in a narrow belt.
• The first successful textile mill was
established in Mumbai in 1854.
• The two world wars were fought in Europe,
India was a British colony. There was a
demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave
a boost to the development of the cotton
textile industry.
The first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in
1855 at Rishra.  After Partition in 1947, the
jute mills remained in India but three-fourth
of the jute producing area went to
Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).

Mineral-based Industries
Industries that use minerals and metals as raw
materials are called mineral-based industries.
Can you name some industries that would fall
in this category?
Iron and Steel Industry
The iron and steel industry is the basic industry
since all the other industries — heavy, medium
and light, depend on it for their machinery.
Steel is needed to manufacture a variety of
engineering goods, construction material,
defence, medical, telephonic, scientific
equipment and a variety of  consumer goods.
Factors responsible for their location in the
Hugli basin are: proximity of the jute producing
areas, inexpensive water transport, supported
by a good network of railways, roadways and
waterways to facilitate movement of raw
material to the mills, abundant water for
processing raw jute, cheap labour from West
Bengal and adjoining states of Bihar, Odisha
and Uttar Pradesh. Kolkata as a large urban
centre provides banking, insurance and port
facilities for export of jute goods.
Sugar Industry
India stands second as a world producer of
sugar but occupies the first place in the
production of gur and khandsari. The raw
material used in this industry is bulky, and in
haulage its sucrose content reduces. The mills
are located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,

seasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the
cooperative sector. Can you explain why this
is so?
In recent years, there is a tendency for the
mills to shift and concentrate in the southern
and western states, especially in Maharashtra,
This is because the cane produced here has a
higher sucrose content. The cooler climate also
ensures a longer crushing season. Moreover,
the cooperatives are more successful in these
states.
Make a list of all such goods made of steel
that you can think of.

Processes of Manufacture of Steel
Production and consumption of steel is
often regarded as the index of a country’s
development. Iron and steel is a heavy industry
because all the raw materials as well as
finished goods are heavy and bulky entailing
heavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking
coal and lime stone are required in the ratio of
approximately 4 : 2 : 1. Some quantities of
manganese, are also required to harden the
steel. Where should the steel plants be ideally
located?  Remember that the finished products
also need an efficient transport network for
their distribution to the markets and
consumers.

Chhotanagpur plateau region has the
maximum concentration of iron and steel
industries. It is largely, because of the relative
advantages this region has for the development
of this industry. These include, low cost of iron
ore, high grade raw materials in proximity,
cheap labour and vast growth potential in the
home market.
Aluminium Smelting
Aluminium smelting is the second most
important metallurgical industry in India.  It is
light, resistant to corrosion, a good conductor of
heat, malleable and becomes strong when it is
mixed with other metals. It is used to
manufacture aircraft, utensils and wires. It has
gained popularity as a substitute of steel, copper,
zinc and lead in a number of industries.
Aluminium smelting plants in the country
are located in Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala,
Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,  Maharashtra and
Tamil Nadu.
Bauxite, the raw material used in the
smelters is a very bulky, dark reddish coloured
rock. The flow chart given below shows the
process of manufacturing aluminium.  Regular
supply of electricity and an assured source of
raw material at minimum cost are the two
prime factors for location of the industry.
Chemical Industries
The Chemical industry in India is fast growing
and diversifying. It comprises both large and
small scale manufacturing units. Rapid growth
has been recorded in both inorganic and
organic sectors.  Inorganic chemicals include
sulphuric acid (used to manufacture fertilizers,
synthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives, paints,
dyes stuffs), nitric acid, alkalies, soda ash (used
to make glass, soaps and detergents, paper)
and caustic soda.  These industries are widely
spread over the country.
Why do you think it is so?
Organic chemicals include petrochemicals,
which are used for manufacturing of synthetic
fibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, dye-stuffs,
drugs and pharmaceuticals. Organic chemical

petrochemical plants.
The chemical industry is its own largest
consumer. Basic chemicals undergo processing
to further produce other chemicals that are
used for industrial application, agriculture or
directly for consumer markets.  Make a list of
the products you are aware of.
Fertilizer Industry
The fertilizer industry is centred around the
production of nitrogenous fertilizers  (mainly
urea), phosphatic fertilizers and ammonium
phosphate (DAP) and complex fertilizers which
have a combination of nitrogen (N), phosphate
(P), and potash (K). The third, i.e. potash is
entirely imported as the country does not have
any reserves of commercially usable potash or
potassium compounds in any form.
After the Green Revolution the industry
expanded to several other parts of the country.
Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and
Kerala contribute towards half of the fertilizer
production. Other significant producers are
Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar,
Maharashtra, Assam, West Bengal, Goa, Delhi,
Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.
Cement Industry
Cement is essential for construction activity
such as building houses, factories, bridges,
roads, airports, dams and for other commercial
establishments. This industry requires bulky
and heavy raw materials like limestone, silica
and gypsum. Coal and electric power are
needed apart from rail transportation.
Automobile Industry
Automobiles provide vehicle for quick
transport of good services and passengers.
Trucks, buses, cars, motor cycles, scooters,
three-wheelers and multi-utility vehicles are
manufactured in India at various centres. After
the liberalisation, the coming in of new and
contemporary models stimulated the demand
for vehicles in the market, which led to the
healthy growth of the industry including
passenger cars, two and three-wheelers. The
industry is located around Delhi, Gurugram,
Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow,
Indore, Hyderabad, Jamshedpur and
Bengaluru.
Information Technology and
Electronics Industry
The electronics industry covers a wide range
of products from transistor sets to television,
telephones, cellular telecom, telephone
exchange, radars, computers and many
other equipments required by the
telecommunication industry. Bengaluru has
emerged as the electronic capital of India. Other
important centres for electronic goods are
Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai,
Kolkata, Lucknow and Coimbatore.   The major
industry concentration is at Bengaluru, Noida,
Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune.  A
major impact of this industry has been on
employment generation. The continuing
growth in the hardware and software is the key
to the success of IT industry in India.

Industrial Pollution and Environmental
Degradation
Although industries contribute significantly to
India’s economic growth and development, the
increase in pollution of land, water, air, noise
and resulting degradation of environment that
they have caused, cannot be overlooked.
Industries are responsible for four types of
pollution: (a) Air  (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise.
The polluting industries also include thermal
power plants.
Air pollution is caused by the presence of high
proportion of undesirable gases, such as
sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Air-
borne particulate materials contain both solid
and liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and
smoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and
paper factories, brick kilns, refineries and
smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in
big and small factories that ignore pollution
norms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous
with long-term effects. Are you aware of the
Bhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air
pollution adversely affects human health,
animals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere
as a whole.
Water pollution is caused by organic and
inorganic industrial wastes and affluents
discharged into rivers. The main culprits in this
regard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and
dyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and
electroplating industries that let out dyes,
detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like
lead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,
synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and
rubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,
phospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are
the major solid wastes in India.
Thermal pollution of water occurs when hot
water from factories and thermal plants is
drained into rivers and ponds before cooling.
What would be the effect on aquatic life?
Wastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear
and weapon production facilities cause
cancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil
and water pollution are closely related.
Dumping of wastes specially glass, harmful
chemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts
and garbage renders the soil useless. Rain
water percolates to the soil carrying the
pollutants to the ground and the ground water
also gets contaminated.
Noise pollution not only results in irritation
and anger, it can also cause hearing
impairment, increased heart rate and blood
pressure among other physiological effects.
Unwanted sound is an irritant and a source of
stress.  Industrial and construction activities,
machinery, factory equipment, generators,
saws and pneumatic and electric drills also
make a lot of noise.
Control of Environmental Degradation
Every litre of waste water discharged by our
industry pollutes eight times the quantity of
freshwater. How can the industrial pollution of
fresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are-
(i) minimising use water for processing by
reusing and recycling it in two or more
successive stages
(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water
requirements
(iii) treating hot water and  effluents before
releasing them in rivers and ponds.
Treatment of industrial effluents can be
done in three phases
(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.
This involves screening, grinding,
flocculation and sedimentation.
(b) Secondary treatment by biological process
(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,
chemical and physical processes. This
involves recycling of wastewater.
Overdrawing of ground water reserves by
industry where there is a threat to ground
water resources also needs to be regulated
legally. Particulate matter in the air can be
reduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories
with electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,
scrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke
can be reduced by using oil or gas instead

equipment can be used and generators
should be fitted with silencers. Almost all
machinery can be redesigned to increase
energy efficiency and reduce noise. Noise
absorbing material may be used apart from
personal use of earplugs and earphones.
The challenge of sustainable development
requires integration of economic development
with environmental concerns.
(a) Optimum utilisation of equipment
adopting latest techniques and
upgrading existing equipment.
(b) Minimising waste generation by
maximising ash utilisation.
(c) Providing green belts for nurturing
ecological balance and addressing the
question of special purpose vehicles for
afforestation.
(d) Reducing environmental pollution
through ash pond management, ash
water recycling system and liquid waste
management.
(e) Ecological monitoring, reviews and
on-line database management for all
its power stations.

We use different materials and services in our
daily life. Some of these are available in our
immediate surroundings, while other
requirements are met by bringing things from
other places. Goods and services do not move
from supply locales to demand locales on their
own. The movement of these goods and services
from their supply locations to demand locations
necessitates the need for transport. Some people
are engaged in facilitating these movements.
These are known to be traders who make the
products come to the consumers by
transportation. Thus, the pace of development
of a country depends upon the production of
goods and services as well as their movement
over space. Therefore, efficient means of transport
are prerequisites for fast development.
Movement of these goods and services can be
over three important domains of our earth i.e. land,
water and air. Based on these, transport can also
be classified into land, water and air transport.
the help of equally developed communication
system. Therefore, transport, communication
and trade are complementary to each other.
Today, India is well-linked with the rest of
the world despite its vast size, diversity and
linguistic and socio-cultural plurality.
Railways, airways, waterways, newspapers,
radio, television, cinema and internet, etc. have
been contributing to its socio-economic
progress in many ways. The trades from local
to international levels have added to the vitality

means of transport and communication serve
as lifelines of our nation and its modern
economy. It is thus, evident that a dense and
efficient network of transport and
communication is a prerequisite for local,
national and global trade of today.

and maintained. The growing importance of
road transport vis-à-vis rail transport is
rooted in the following reasons; (a)
construction cost of roads is much lower
than that of railway lines, (b) roads can
traverse comparatively more dissected and
undulating topography, (c) roads can
negotiate higher gradients of slopes and as
such can traverse mountains such as the
Himalayas, (d) road transport is economical
in transportation of few persons and
relatively smaller amount of goods over
short distances, (e) it also provides door-
to-door service, thus the cost of loading
and unloading is much lower, (f) road
transport is also used as a feeder to other
modes of transport such as they provide a
link between railway stations, air and
sea ports.
In India, roads are classified in the
following six classes according to their
capacity. Look at the map of the National
Highways and find out about the significant
role played by these roads.
• Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:
The government has launched a major
road development project linking Delhi-
Kolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by
six-lane Super Highways. The North-
South corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu
& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil
Nadu), 
and 
East-West 
Corridor
connecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander
(Gujarat) are part of this project. The
major objective of these Super Highways
is to reduce the time and distance
between the mega cities of India. These
highway projects are being implemented
by the National Highway Authority of
India (NHAI).
• National Highways: National Highways
link extreme parts of the country. These
are the primary road systems. A number
of major National Highways run in North-
South and East-West directions.
• State Highways: Roads linking a state
capital with different district headquarters
are known as State Highways.
• District Roads: These roads connect the
district headquarters with other places of
the district.
• Other Roads: Rural roads, which link rural
areas and villages with towns, are classified
under this category. These roads received
special impetus under the Pradhan Mantri
Grameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme
special provisions are made so that every
village in the country is linked to a major
town in the country by an all season
motorable road.
• Border Roads: Apart from these, Border
Roads Organisation a Government of India
undertaking constructs and maintains
roads in the bordering areas of the
country. This organisation was established
in 1960 for the development of the roads
of strategic importance in the northern and
north-eastern border areas. These roads
have improved accessibility in areas of
difficult terrain and have helped in the
economic development of these area.

Roads can also be classified on the basis of
the type of material used for their construction
such as metalled and unmetalled roads.
Metalled roads may be made of cement,
concrete or even bitumen of coal, therefore,
these are all weather roads. Unmetalled roads
go out of use in the rainy season.
Railways
Railways are the principal mode of
transportation for freight and passengers
in India. Railways also make it possible for
people to conduct multifarious activities
like business, sightseeing, pilgrimage
along with transportation of goods over
longer distances. Apart from an important
means of transport the Indian Railways
have been a great integrating force for more
than 150 years. Railways in India bind the
economic life of the country as well as
accelerate the development of the industry
and agriculture.
The Indian Railway is now reorganised into
17 zones.
The World’s longest Highway tunnel-Atal
Tunnel (9.02 Km) has been built by Border
Road Organisation. This tunnel connects
Manali to Lahul-Spiti valley throughout the
year. Earlier the valley was cut off for about
6 months each year owing to heavy snowfall.
The tunnel is buit with ultra-modern
specifications in the Pir Panjal range of
Himalayas at an altitude of 3000 metres
from the Mean Sea Level (MSL).

The distribution pattern of the Railway
network in the country has been largely

administrative factors.  The northern plains with
their vast level land, high population density
and rich agricultural resources provided the most
favourable condition for their growth.  However,
a large number of rivers requiring construction
of bridges across their wide beds posed some
obstacles.  In the hilly terrains of the peninsular
region, railway tracts are laid through low hills,
gaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous
regions too are unfavourable for the construction
of railway lines due to high relief, sparse
population and lack of economic opportunities.

Waterways
Since the ancient period, India was one of the
seafaring countries.  Its seamen sailed far and
near, thus, carrying and spreading Indian
commerce and culture. Waterways are the
cheapest means of transport. They are most
suitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It
is a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode
of transport. India has inland navigation
waterways of 14,500 km in length. In order to
create wide waterways network and to promote
inland water transport in the country as an

only through gaps or passes (Ghats). In recent
times, the development of the Konkan railway
along the west coast has facilitated the movement
of passengers and goods in this most important
economic region of India. It has also faced a
number of problem such as sinking of track in
some stretches and landslides.
Today, the railways have become more
important in our national economy than all
other means of transport put together. However,
rail transport suffers from certain problems as
well. Many passengers travel without tickets.
Thefts and damaging of railway property has
not yet stopped completely.  People stop the
trains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this
causes heavy damage to the railway. Think over
it, how we can help our railway in running as
per the scheduled time?
Pipelines
Pipeline transport network is a new arrival on
the transportation map of India.  In the past,
these were used to transport water to cities and
industries. Now, these are used for transporting
crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas
from oil and natural gas fields to refineries,
fertilizer factories and big thermal power plants.
Solids can also be transported through a
pipeline when converted into slurry. The far
inland locations of refineries like Barauni,
Mathura, Panipat and gas based fertilizer plants
could be thought of only because of pipelines.
Initial cost of laying pipelines is high but
subsequent running costs are minimal.  It rules
out trans-shipment losses or delays.
There are three important networks of
pipeline transportation in the country.

Communication
Ever since humans appeared on the earth,
they have used different means of
communication. But, the pace of change, has
been rapid in modern times. Long distance
communication is far easier without physical
movement of the communicator or receiver.
Personal communication and mass
communication including television, radio,
press, films, etc. are the major means of
communication in the country. The Indian
postal network is the largest in the world. It
handles parcels as well as personal written
communications. Cards and envelopes are
considered first-class mail and are airlifted
between stations covering both land and air.
The second-class mail includes book packets,
registered newspapers and periodicals. They
are carried by surface mail, covering land and
water transport. To facilitate quick delivery
of mails in large towns and cities, six mail
channels have been introduced recently. They
are called Rajdhani Channel, Metro Channel,
Green Channel, Business Channel, Bulk Mail
Channel and Periodical Channel.

International Trade
The exchange of goods among people, states
and countries is referred to as trade. The
market is the place where such exchanges
take place. Trade between two countries is
called international trade. It may take place
through sea, air or land routes. While local
trade is carried in cities, towns and villages,
state level trade is carried between two or more
states. Advancement of international trade of
a country is an index to its economic
prosperity. It is, therefore, considered the
economic barometer for a country.
As the resources are space bound, no
country can survive without international
trade. Export and import are the components
of trade. The balance of trade of a country is
the difference between its export and import.
When the value of export exceeds the value
of imports, it is called a favourable balance
of trade. On the contrary, if the value of
imports exceeds the value of exports, it is
termed as unfavourable balance of trade.
India has trade relations with all the major
trading blocks and all geographical regions
of the world. The commodities exported from
India to other countries include gems and
jewellery, chemicals and related products,
agriculture and allied products, etc.
India has one of the largest telecom
networks in Asia. Excluding urban places more

Everything available in our environment
which can be used to satisfy our needs,
provided, it is technologically accessible,
economically feasible and culturally
acceptable can be termed as ‘Resource’.
The process of transformation of things
available in our environment involves an
interactive relationship between nature,
technology and institutions. Human beings
interact with nature through technology and
create institutions to accelerate their
economic development.
Do you think that resources are free
gifts of nature as is assumed by many?
They are not. Resources are a function of
human activities. Human beings themselves
are essential components of resources. They
transform material available in our
environment into resources and use them.
These resources can be classified in the
following ways–
(a) On the basis of origin – biotic and abiotic
(b) On the basis of exhaustibility – renewable
and non-renewable
(c) On the basis of ownership – individual,
community, national and international
(d) On the basis of status of development –
potential, developed stock and reserves.
Can you identify and name the various items
used in making life comfortable in our villages
and towns. List the items and name the
material used in their making.

DEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCES
Resources are vital for human survival as well
as for maintaining the quality of life. It was
believed that resources are free gifts of nature.
As a result, human beings used them
indiscriminately and this has led to the
following major problems.
• Depletion of resources for satisfying the
greed of a few individuals.
• Accumulation of resources in few hands, which,
in turn, divided the society into two segments
i.e. haves  and have nots or rich and poor.
• Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has
led to global ecological crises such as, global
warming, ozone layer depletion, environmental
pollution and land degradation.
An equitable distribution of resources has
become essential for a sustained quality of life
and global peace. If the present trend of
resource depletion by a few individuals and
countries continues, the future of our planet
is in danger.
Therefore, resource planning is essential for
sustainable existence of all forms of life.
Sustainable existence is a component of
sustainable development.
Sustainable development
Sustainable economic development means
‘development should take place without
damaging the environment, and development
in the present should not compromise with the
needs of the future generations.’
Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992
In June 1992, more than 100 heads of states
met in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first
International Earth Summit. The Summit was
convened for addressing urgent problems of
environmental protection and socio-
economic development at the global level.
The assembled leaders signed the
Declaration on Global Climatic Change and
Biological Diversity. The Rio Convention
endorsed the global Forest Principles and
adopted Agenda 21 for achieving
Sustainable Development in the 21st century.
Agenda 21
It is the declaration signed by world leaders
in 1992 at the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development (UNCED),
which took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It
aims at achieving global sustainable
development. It is an agenda to combat
environmental damage, poverty, disease
through global co-operation on common
interests, mutual needs and shared
responsibilities. One major objective of the
Agenda 21 is that every local government
should draw its own local Agenda 21.
RESOURCE PLANNING
Planning is the widely accepted strategy for
judicious use of resources. It has importance
in a country like India, which has enormous
diversity in the availability of resources. There
are regions which are rich in certain types of
resources but are deficient in some other

RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT
resources. There are some regions which can
be considered self sufficient in terms of the
availability of resources and there are some
regions which have acute shortage of some vital
resources. For example, the states of
Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya
Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.
Arunachal Pradesh has abundance of water
resources but lacks in infrastructural
development. The state of Rajasthan is very well
endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks
in water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh
is relatively isolated from the rest of the
country. It has very rich cultural heritage but
it is deficient in water, infrastructure and some
vital minerals. This calls for balanced resource
planning at the national, state, regional and
local levels.
technology and institutions may hinder
development. There are many regions in our
country that are rich in resources but these
are included in economically backward
regions. On the contrary there are some regions
which have a poor resource base but they are
economically developed.
Can you name some resource rich but
economically backward regions and some
resource poor but economically developed
regions? Give reasons for such a situation.
The history  of colonisation reveals that
rich resources in colonies were the main
attractions for the foreign invaders. It was
primarily the higher level of technological
development of the colonising countries that
helped them to exploit resources of other
regions and establish their supremacy over
the colonies. Therefore, resources can
contribute to development only when they are
accompanied by appropriate technological
development and institutional changes. India
has experienced all this in different phases of
colonisation. Therefore, in India, development,
in general, and resource development in
particular does not only involve the
availability of resources, but also the
technology, quality of human resources and
the historical experiences of the people.
Conservation of Resources: Resources are
vital for any developmental activity. But
irrational consumption and over-utilisation
of resources may lead to socio-economic and
environmental problems. To overcome these
problems, resource conservation at various
levels is important. This had been the main
concern of the leaders and thinkers in the
past. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in
voicing his concern about resource
conservation in these words: “There is enough
Resource Planning in India
Resource planning is a complex process
which involves : (i) identification and
inventory of resources across the regions of
the country. This involves surveying,
mapping and qualitative and quantitative
estimation and measurement of the
resources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure
endowed with appropriate technology, skill
and institutional set up for implementing
resource development plans. (iii) Matching
the resource development plans with overall
national development plans.
India has made concerted efforts for
achieving the goals of resource planning right
from the First Five Year Plan launched after
Independence.

available land for various purposes with careful
planning.
India has land under a variety of relief
features, namely; mountains, plateaus, plains
and islands. About 43 per cent of the land area
is plain, which provides facilities for agriculture
and industry. Mountains account for 30 per
cent of the total surface area of the country and
ensure perennial flow of some rivers, provide
facilities for tourism and ecological aspects.
About  27 per cent of the area of the country is
the plateau region. It possesses rich reserves
of minerals, fossil fuels and forests.
LAND UTILISATION
Land resources are used for the following
purposes:
1. Forests
2. Land not available for cultivation
(a) Barren and waste land
(b) Land put to non-agricultural uses, e.g.
buildings, roads, factories, etc.
3. Other uncultivated land (excluding
fallow land)
(a) Permanent pastures and grazing land,
(b) Land under miscellaneous tree crops
groves (not included in net  sown area),
(c) Culturable waste land (left uncultivated
for more than 5 agricultural years).
4. Fallow lands
(a) Current fallow-(left without cultivation
for one or less than one agricultural year),
(b) Other than current fallow-(left
uncultivated for the past 1 to 5
agricultural years).
5. Net sown area– the physical extent of land
on which crops are sown harvested is
known as net sown area.
Area sown more than once in an
agricultural year plus net sown area is
known as gross cropped area.
LAND USE PATTERN IN INDIA
The use of land is determined both by physical
factors such as topography, climate, soil types
as well as human factors such as population
density, technological capability and culture
and traditions etc.
for everybody’s need and not for any body’s
greed.” He placed the greedy and selfish
individuals and exploitative nature of modern
technology as the root cause for resource
depletion at the global level. He was against
mass production and wanted to replace it with
the production by the masses.
At the international level, the Club of Rome
advocated resource conservation for the first
time in a more systematic way in 1968.
Subsequently, in 1974, Gandhian philosophy
was once again presented by Schumacher
in his book Small is Beautiful. The seminal
contribution with respect to resource
conservation at the global level was made
by the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987.
This report introduced the concept of
‘Sustainable Development’ and advocated
it as a means for resource conservation,
which was subsequently published in a book
entitled Our Common Future. Another
significant contribution was made at the Earth
Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992.
LAND RESOURCES
We live on land, we perform our economic
activities on land and we use it in different
ways. Thus, land is a natural resource of
utmost importance. It supports natural
vegetation, wild life, human life, economic
activities, transport and communication
systems. However, land is an asset of a finite
magnitude, therefore, it is important to use the

fringes of these forests depends upon it. A part
of the land is termed as waste land and land
put to other non-agricultural uses. Waste land
includes rocky, arid and desert areas and land
put to other non-agricultural uses includes
settlements, roads, railways, industry etc.
Continuous use of land over a long period of
time without taking appropriate measures to
conserve and manage it, has resulted in land
degradation. This, in turn, has serious
repercussions on society and the
environment.
LAND DEGRADATION AND CONSERVATION
MEASURES
We have shared our land with the past
generations and will have to do so with the future
generations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic
needs for food, shelter and clothing are obtained
from land. Human activities have not only
brought about degradation of land but have
also aggravated the pace of natural forces to
cause damage to land.
Some human activities such as
deforestation, over grazing, mining and
quarrying too have contributed significantly in
land degradation.
Mining sites are abandoned after
excavation work is complete leaving deep
scars and traces of over-burdening. In states
like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya
Pradesh and Odisha deforestation due to
mining have caused severe land degradation.
In states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one
of the main reasons for land degradation. In
the states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar
Pradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land
degradation due to water logging leading to
increase in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.
The mineral processing like grinding of
limestone for cement industry and calcite and
soapstone for ceramic industry generate huge
quantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards
the process of infiltration of water into the soil
after it settles down on the land. In recent
years, industrial effluents as waste have
become a major source of land and water
pollution in many parts of the country.
There are many ways to solve the problems
of land degradation. Afforestation and proper
management of grazing can help to some extent.
Planting of shelter belts of plants, control on
over grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by
growing thorny bushes are some of the
methods to check land degradation in arid
areas. Proper management of waste lands,
control of mining activities, proper discharge
and disposal of industrial effluents and wastes
after treatment can reduce land and water
degradation in industrial and suburban areas.
SOIL AS A RESOURCE
Soil is the most important renewable natural
resource. It is the medium of plant growth
and supports different types of living organisms
on the earth. The soil is a living system. It
takes  millions of years to form soil upto a few
cm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock,
climate, vegetation and other forms of life and
time are important factors in the formation of
soil. Various forces of nature such as change
in temperature, actions of running water, wind
and glaciers, activities of decomposers etc.
contribute to the formation of soil. Chemical

soil are equally important. Soil also consists
of organic (humus) and inorganic materials
(Fig. 1.5).
On the basis of the factors responsible for
soil formation, colour, thickness, texture, age,
chemical and physical properties, the soils of
India are classified in different types.
Classification of Soils
India has varied relief features, landforms,
climatic realms and vegetation types. These
have contributed in the development of various
types of soils.
Alluvial Soils
This is the most widely spread and important
soil. In fact, the entire northern plains are
made of alluvial soil. These have been
deposited by three important Himalayan river
systems– the Indus, the Ganga and the
Brahmaputra. These soils also extend in
Rajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow
corridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the
eastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas
of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna
and the Kaveri rivers.
nodules than the Khadar. It has more fine
particles and is more fertile than the bangar.
Alluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.
Mostly these soils contain adequate proportion
of potash, phosphoric acid and lime which
are ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,
wheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due
to its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are
intensively cultivated and densely populated.
Soils in the drier areas are more alkaline and
can be productive after proper treatment and
irrigation.

These soils are black in colour and are also
known as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for
growing cotton and is also known as black
cotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition
along with the parent rock material are the
important factors for the formation of black
soil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan
trap (Basalt) region spread over northwest
Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.
They cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,
Saurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and
Chhattisgarh and extend in the south east
direction along the Godavari and the Krishna
valleys.
Fig. 1.6:  Alluvial Soil
The alluvial soil consists of various
proportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move
inlands towards the river valleys, soil particles
appear some what bigger in size. In the upper
reaches of the river valley i.e. near the place
of the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such
soils are more common in piedmont plains
such as Duars, Chos and Terai.
Apart from the size of their grains or
components, soils are also described on the
basis of their age. According to their age
alluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial
(Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The
bangar soil has higher concentration of kanker
The black soils are made up of extremely
fine i.e. clayey material. They are well-known
for their capacity to hold moisture. In addition,
they are rich in soil nutrients, such as calcium
carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime. These

RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT
soils are generally poor in phosphoric contents.
They develop deep cracks during hot weather,
which helps in the proper aeration of the soil.
These soils are sticky when wet and difficult to
work on unless tilled immediately after the first
shower or during the pre-monsoon period.
Red and Yellow Soils
Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks
in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and
southern parts of the Deccan plateau. Yellow
and red soils are also found in parts of
Odisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the
middle Ganga plain and along the piedmont
zone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop
a reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in
crystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks
yellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.
Laterite Soil
Laterite has been derived from the Latin word
‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil
develops under tropical and subtropical
climate with alternate wet and dry season.
This soil is the result of intense leaching due
to heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep
to very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally
deficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly
in southern states, Western Ghats region of
Maharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West
Bengal and North-east regions. Where these
soils support deciduous and evergreen
forests, it is humus rich, but under sparse
vegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is
generally humus poor. They are prone to
erosion and degradation due to their position
on the landscape. After adopting appropriate
soil conservation techniques particularly in
the hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil
Nadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea
and coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable
for crops like cashew nut.
Arid Soils
Arid soils range from red to brown in colour.
They are generally sandy in texture and saline
in nature.  In some areas the salt content is
very high and common salt is obtained by
evaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,
high temperature, evaporation is faster and
the soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower
horizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar
because of the increasing calcium content
downwards. The Kankar layer formations in
the bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of
water. After proper irrigation these soils
become cultivable as has been in the case of
western Rajasthan.
Fig. 1.8:  Laterite Soil
Forest Soils
These soils are found in the hilly and
mountainous areas where sufficient rain
forests are available.  The soils texture varies
according to the mountain environment
where they are formed.  They are loamy and
silty in valley sides and coarse grained in
the upper slopes. In the snow covered areas

CONTEMPORARY INDIA – II
of Himalayas, these soils experience
denudation and are acidic with low humus
content.  The soils found in the lower parts of
the valleys particularly on the river terraces
and alluvial fans are fertile.
Soil Erosion and Soil Conservation
The denudation of the soil cover and
subsequent washing down is described as soil
erosion. The processes of soil formation and
erosion, go on simultaneously and generally
there is a balance between the two. Sometimes,
this balance is disturbed due to human
activities like deforestation, over-grazing,
construction and mining etc., while natural
forces like wind, glacier and water lead to
soil erosion. The running water cuts through
the clayey soils and makes deep channels as
gullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation
and is known as bad land. In the Chambal
basin such lands are called ravines.
Sometimes water flows as a sheet over large
areas down a slope. In such cases the top
Fig. 1.11:  Gully Erosion
soil is washed away. This is known as sheet
erosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or
sloping land known as wind erosion. Soil
erosion is also caused due to defective methods
of farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up
and down the slope form channels for the
quick flow of water leading to soil erosion.
Ploughing along the contour lines can
decelerate the flow of water down the slopes.
This is called contour ploughing. Steps can
be cut out on the slopes making terraces.
Terrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western
and central Himalayas have well developed
terrace farming. Large fields can be divided into
strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between
the crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.
This method is known as strip cropping.
Planting lines of trees to create shelter also
works in a similar way. Rows of such trees are
called shelter belts. These shelter belts have
contributed significantly to the stabilisation of
sand dunes and in stabilising the desert in
western India.

We share this planet with millions of other
living beings, starting from micro-organisms
and bacteria, lichens to banyan trees,
elephants and blue whales. This entire
habitat that we live in has immense
biodiversity. We humans along with all
living organisms form a complex web of
ecological system in which we are only a
part and very much dependent on this
system for our own existence. For example,
the plants, animals and micro-organisms
re-create the quality of the air we breathe,
the water we drink and the soil that
produces our food without which we
cannot survive. Forests play a key role in
the ecological system as these are also the
primary producers on which all other living
beings depend.

If you look around, you will be able to find
that there are some animals and plants which
are unique in your area. In fact, India is
one of the world’s richest countries in terms

may have realised the importance of
these resources in our daily life. These
diverse flora and fauna are so well
integrated in our daily life that we take
these for granted. But, lately, they are
under great stress mainy due to insensitivity
to our environment.

Conservation of Forest and Wildlife in India
Conservation in the background of rapid
decline in wildlife population and forestry has
become essential. But why do we need to
conserve our forests and wildlife?
Conservation preserves the ecological diversity
and our life support systems – water, air and
soil. It also preserves the genetic diversity of
plants and animals for better growth of species
and breeding. For example, in agriculture,
we are still dependent on traditional crop
varieties. Fisheries too are heavily dependent
on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity.
In the 1960s and 1970s, conservationists
demanded a national wildlife protection
programme. The Indian Wildlife (Protection)
Reprint 2025-26
14
CONTEMPORARY INDIA – II
Act was implemented in 1972, with various
provisions for protecting habitats. An all-
India list of protected species was also
published. The thrust of the programme was
towards protecting the remaining population
of certain endangered species by banning
hunting, giving legal protection to their
habitats, and restricting trade in wildlife.
Subsequently, central and many state
governments established national parks and
wildlife sanctuaries about which you have
already studied. The central government also
announced several projects for protecting
specific animals, which were gravely
threatened, including the tiger, the one-
horned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or
hangul, three types of crocodiles – fresh
water crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the
Gharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most
recently, the Indian elephant, black buck
(chinkara), the great Indian bustard
(godawan) and the snow leopard, etc. have
been given full or partial legal protection
against hunting and trade throughout India.

Project Tiger
Tiger is one of the key wildlife species in
the faunal web. In 1973, the authorities
realised that the tiger population had
dwindled to 1,827 from an estimated
55,000 at the turn of the century. The major
threats to tiger population are numerous,
such as poaching for trade, shrinking
habitat, depletion of prey base species,
growing human population, etc. The trade
of tiger skins and the use of their bones in
traditional medicines, especially in the
Asian countries left the tiger population on
the verge of extinction. Since India and
Nepal provide habitat to about two-thirds
of the surviving tiger population in the
world, these two nations became prime
targets for poaching and illegal trading.
“Project Tiger”, one of the well-
publicised wildlife campaigns in the world,
was launched in 1973. Tiger conservation

much of its forest and wildlife resources are
either owned or managed by the government
through the Forest Department or other
government departments. These are classified
under the following categories.
(i) Reserved Forests: More than half of the
total forest land has been declared
reserved forests. Reserved forests are
regarded as the most valuable as far as the
conservation of forest and wildlife resources
are concerned.
(ii) Protected Forests: Almost one-third of the
total forest area is protected forest, as
declared by the Forest Department. This
forest land are protected from any further

both government and private individuals
and communities.
Reserved and protected forests are also
referred to as permanent forest estates
maintained for the purpose of producing
timber and other forest produce, and for
protective reasons. Madhya Pradesh has the
largest area under permanent forests,
constituting 75 per cent of its total forest area.
Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh,
Uttarakhand, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West
Bengal, and Maharashtra have large
percentages of reserved forests of its total forest
area whereas Bihar, Haryana, Punjab,

The conservation projects are now focusing
on biodiversity rather than on a few of its
components. There is now a more intensive
search for different conservation measures.
Increasingly, even insects are beginning to find
a place in conservation planning. In the
notification under Wildlife Act of 1980 and
1986, several hundred butterflies, moths,
beetles, and one dragonfly have been added to
the list of protected species. In 1991, for the
first time plants were also added to the list,
starting with six species.

eastern states and parts of Gujarat have a very
high percentage of their forests as unclassed
forests managed by local communities.
Community and Conservation
Conservation strategies are not new in our
country. We often ignore that in India, forests
are also home to some of the traditional
communities. In some areas of India, local
communities are struggling to conserve these
habitats along with government officials,
recognising that only this will secure their
own long-term livelihood. In Sariska Tiger
Reserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought
against mining by citing the Wildlife Protection
Act. In many areas, villagers themselves are
protecting habitats and explicitly rejecting
government involvement. The inhabitants of
five villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan
have declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the
Bhairodev Dakav ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their
own set of rules and regulations which do not
allow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife
against any outside encroachments.
The famous Chipko movement in the
Himalayas has not only successfully resisted
deforestation in several areas but has also
shown that community afforestation with
indigenous species can be enormously
successful. Attempts to revive the traditional
conservation methods or developing new
methods of ecological farming are now
widespread. Farmers and citizen’s groups like
the Beej Bachao Andolan in Tehri and
Navdanya have shown that adequate levels of
diversified crop production without the use of
synthetic chemicals are possible and
economically viable.

Sacred groves - a wealth of diverse and rare
species
Nature worship is an age old tribal belief based on
the premise that all creations of nature have to be
protected. Such beliefs have preserved several virgin
forests in pristine form called Sacred Groves (the
forests of God and Goddesses). These patches of
forest or parts of large forests have been left
untouched by the local people and any interference
with them is banned.
Certain societies revere a particular tree which
they have preserved from time immemorial. The
Mundas and the Santhal of Chota Nagpur region
worship mahua (Bassia latifolia) and kadamba
(Anthocaphalus cadamba) trees, and the tribals of
Odisha and Bihar worship the tamarind (Tamarindus
indica) and mango (Mangifera indica) trees during
weddings. To many of us, peepal and banyan trees
are considered sacred.
Indian society comprises several cultures, each
with its own set of traditional methods of conserving
nature and its creations. Sacred qualities are often
ascribed to springs, mountain peaks, plants and
animals which are closely protected. You will find
troops of macaques and langurs around many
temples. They are fed daily and treated as a part of
temple devotees. In and around Bishnoi villages in
Rajasthan, herds of blackbuck, (chinkara), nilgai and
peacocks can be seen as an integral part of the
community and nobody harms them.
forests. The programme has been in formal
existence since 1988 when the state of
Odisha passed the first resolution for joint
forest management. JFM depends on the
formation of local (village) institutions that
undertake protection activities mostly on
degraded forest land managed by the forest
department. In return, the members of
these communities are entitled to
intermediary benefits like non-timber
forest produces and share in the timber
harvested by ‘successful protection’.
The clear lesson from the dynamics of
both environmental destruction and
reconstruction in India is that local
communities everywhere have to be
involved in some kind of natural resource
management. But there is still a long way
to go before local communities are at the
centre-stage in decision-making. Accept
only those economic or developmental
activities, that are people centric,
environment-friendly and economically
rewarding.

You already know that three-fourth of the
earth’s surface is covered with water, but only
a small proportion of it accounts for
freshwater that can be put to use. This
freshwater is mainly obtained from surface
run off and ground water that is continually
being renewed and recharged through the
hydrological cycle. All water moves within the
hydrological cycle ensuring that water is a
renewable resource.
You might wonder that if three-fourth of

consequent greater demands for water, and
unequal access to it. A large population
requires more water not only for domestic
use but also to produce more food. Hence, to
facilitate higher food-grain production, water
resources are being over-exploited to expand
irrigated areas for dry-season agriculture.
Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer
of water. Now it is needed to revolutionise the
agriculture through developing drought
resistant crops and dry farming techniques.

excessive use and unequal access to water
among different social groups.
Where is then water scarcity likely to
occur? As you have read in the hydrological
cycle, freshwater can be obtained directly
from precipitation, surface run off and

Is it possible that an area or region may
have ample water resources but is still facing
water scarcity? Many of our cities are such
examples. Thus, water scarcity may be an

Post-independent India witnessed
intensive industrialisation and urbanisation,
creating vast opportunities for us. Today, large
industrial houses are as commonplace as the
industrial units of many MNCs (Multinational
Corporations). The ever-increasing number of
industries has made matters worse by exerting
pressure on existing freshwater resources.
Industries, apart from being heavy users of
water, also require power to run them. Much
of this energy comes from hydroelectric power.
Moreover, multiplying urban centres with
large and dense populations and urban
lifestyles have not only added to water and
energy requirements but have further
aggravated the problem. If you look into the
housing societies or colonies in the cities, you
would find that most of these have their own
groundwater pumping devices to meet their
water needs. Not surprisingly, we find that
fragile water resources are being over-
exploited and have caused their depletion in
several of these cities.

But, how do we conserve and manage water?
Archaeological and historical records show

structures like dams built of stone rubble,
reservoirs or lakes, embankments and canals

continued this tradition in modern India by
building dams in most of our river basins.

the area still suffers from water scarcity. This
scarcity may be due to bad quality of water.
Lately, there has been a growing concern that
even if there is ample water to meet the needs
of the people, much of it may be polluted by
domestic and industrial wastes, chemicals,
pesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture,
thus, making it hazardous for human use.
Government of India has accorded highest
priority to improve the quality of life and
enhance ease of living of people especially those
living in rual areas by announcing the Jal
Jeevan Mission (JJM). The Goal of JJM is to
enable every rural household get assured
supply of potable piped water at a service level
of 55 litres per capita per day regularly on
long-term basis by ensuring functionality of
the tap water connections. (Source: Economic

health hazards, to ensure food security,
continuation of our livelihoods and productive

What are dams and how do they help us
in conserving and managing water? Dams
were traditionally built to impound rivers and
rainwater that could be used later to irrigate
agricultural fields. Today, dams are built not
just for irrigation but for electricity generation,
water supply for domestic and industrial
uses, flood control, recreation, inland
navigation and fish breeding. Hence, dams are
now referred to as multi-purpose projects
where the many uses of the impounded water
are integrated with one another. For example,
in the Sutluj-Beas river basin, the Bhakra –
Nangal project water is being used both for
hydel power production and irrigation.
Similarly, the Hirakud project in the
Mahanadi basin integrates conservation of
water with flood control.
Multi-purpose projects, launched after
Independence with their integrated water
resources management approach, were thought

A dam is a barrier across flowing water that
obstructs, directs or retards the flow, often
creating a reservoir, lake or impoundment.
“Dam” refers to the reservoir rather than the
structure. Most dams have a section called a
spillway or weir over which or through which
it is intended that water will flow either
intermittently or continuously. Dams are
classified according to structure, intended
purpose or height. Based on structure and
the materials used, dams are classified as
timber dams, embankment dams or masonry
dams, with several subtypes. According to
the height, dams can be categorised as large
dams and major dams or alternatively as low
dams, medium height dams and high dams.
handicap of its colonial past. Jawaharlal Nehru
proudly proclaimed the dams as the ‘temples of
modern India’; the reason being that it would
integrate development of agriculture and the
village economy with rapid industrialisation and
growth of the urban economy.

WATER RESOURCES
In recent years, multi-purpose projects
and large dams have come under great
scrutiny and opposition for a variety of
reasons. Regulating and damming of rivers
affect their natural flow causing poor sediment
flow and excessive sedimentation at the bottom
of the reservoir, resulting in rockier stream
beds and poorer habitats for the rivers’ aquatic
life. Dams also fragment rivers making it
difficult for aquatic fauna to migrate, especially
for spawning. The reservoirs that are created
on the floodplains also submerge the existing
vegetation and soil leading to its
decomposition over a period of time.
Ironically, the dams that were constructed
to control floods have triggered floods due to
sedimentation in the reservoir. Moreover, the
big dams have mostly been unsuccessful in
controlling floods at the time of excessive
rainfall.
These floods have not only devastated life
and property but also caused extensive soil
erosion. Sedimentation also meant that the flood
plains were deprived of silt, a natural fertiliser,
further adding on to the problem of land
degradation. It was also observed that the multi-
purpose projects induced earthquakes, caused
water-borne diseases and pests and pollution
resulting from excessive use of water.
Irrigation has also changed the cropping
pattern of many regions with farmers shifting
to water intensive and commercial crops. This
has great ecological consequences like
salinisation of the soil.
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana
has been started which ensures access to some
means to protective irrigation for all agricultural
farms in the country, thus bringing much
desired rural prosperity. Some of the broad
objectives of this programme are to enhance
the physical access of water on the farm and
expand cultivable area under assured
irrigation (har khet ko pani), improve on-farm
water use efficiency to reduce wastage and
increase availability both in duration and
extent, irrigation and other water saving
technologies (per drop more crop) and
introduce sustainable water conservation
practices, etc.

different parts of the country due to heavy

Sardar Sarovar Dam has been built over
the Narmada River in Gujarat. This is one
of the largest water resource projects of
India covering four states—Maharashtra,
Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan.
The Sardar Sarovar project would meet the
requirement of water in drought-prone and
desert areas. Sardar Sarovar Project will
provide irrigation facilities to 18.45 lakh
hectare of land, covering 3112 villages in
15 districts of Gujarat. It will also irrigate
2,46,000 hectare of land in the strategic
desert districts of Barmer and Jalore in
Rajasthan and 37,500 hectare in the tribal
hilly tract of Maharashtra through lift.
About 75 per cent of the command area in
Gujarat is drought prone while entire
command in Rajasthan is drought prone.
Assured water supply will soon make this
area drought proof.

Many thought that given the disadvantages
and rising resistance against the multi-
purpose projects, water harvesting system
was a viable alternative, both socio-
economically and environmentally. In
ancient India, along with the sophisticated
hydraulic structures, there existed an
extraordinary tradition of water-harvesting
system. People had in-depth knowledge of
rainfall regimes and soil types and developed
wide ranging techniques to harvest
rainwater, groundwater, river water and flood
water in keeping with the local ecological
conditions and their water needs. In hill and
mountainous regions, people built diversion
channels like the ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ of the
Western Himalayas for agriculture. ‘Rooftop
rainwater harvesting’ was commonly
practised to store drinking water,
particularly in Rajasthan. In the flood plains
of Bengal, people developed inundation
channels to irrigate their fields. In arid and
semi-arid regions, agricultural fields were
converted into rain fed storage structures
that allowed the water to stand and moisten
the soil like the ‘khadins’ in Jaisalmer and
‘Johads’ in other parts of Rajasthan.
In the semi-arid and arid regions of
Rajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi
and Barmer, almost all the houses
traditionally had underground tanks or
tankas for storing drinking water. The tanks
could be as large as a big room; one
household in Phalodi had a tank that was
6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44
metres wide. The tankas were part of the well-
developed rooftop rainwater harvesting

Tamil Nadu is the first state in India
which has made rooftop rainwater
harvesting structure compulsory to all
the houses across the state. There are
legal provisions to punish the defaulters.
Rooftop rainwater harvesting is the
most common practice in Shillong,
Meghalaya. It is interesting because
Cherapunjee and Mawsynram  situated
at a distance of 55 km. from Shillong
receive the highest rainfall in the world,
yet the state capital Shillong faces acute
shortage of water. Nearly every
household in the city has a rooftop
rainwater harvesting structure. Nearly
15-25 per cent of the total water
requirement of the household comes
from rooftop water harvesting.
room cool.
Today, in western Rajasthan, sadly the
practice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on
the decline as plenty of water is available due
to the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though
some houses still maintain the tankas since
they do not like the taste of tap water.
Fortunately, in many parts of rural and urban
India, rooftop rainwater harvesting is being
successfully adapted to store and conserve
water. In Gendathur, a remote backward
village in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have
installed, in their household’s rooftop,
rainwater harvesting system to meet their
water needs. Nearly 200 households have
installed this system and the village has earned
the rare distinction of being rich in rainwater.
See Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the
rooftop rainwater harvesting system which is
adapted here. Gendathur receives an annual
precipitation of 1,000 mm, and with 80 per
cent of collection efficiency and of about 10
fillings, every house can collect and use about
50,000 litres of water annually. From the 200
houses, the net amount of rainwater harvested
annually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.

and villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on
the sloping roofs of houses is taken through a
pipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in
the ground). built in the main house or in the

BAMBOO DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEM
In Meghalaya, a 200-year-old system of tapping stream
and spring water by using bamboo pipes, is prevalent.
About 18-20 litres of water enters the bamboo pipe system,
gets transported over hundreds of metres, and finally
reduces to 20-80 drops per minute at the site of the plant.
Picture 2 and 3: The channel sections, made of bamboo, divert
water to the plant site where it is distributed into branches, again
made and laid out with different forms of bamboo pipes. The flow of
water into the pipes is controlled by manipulating the pipe positions.
Picture 1: Bamboo pipes are used to divert perennial springs
on the hilltops to the lower reaches by gravity.

Textbook for Class X

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system
of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one
of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of
knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour
in implementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of
teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for
teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather
than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to
address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for
child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the

India is an agriculturally important country.
Two-thirds of its population is engaged in
agricultural activities. Agriculture is a primary
activity, which produces most of the food that
we consume. Besides food grains, it also
produces raw material for various industries.
Can you name some industries based on
agricultural raw material?
Moreover, some agricultural products like tea,
coffee, spices, etc. are also exported.
TYPES OF FARMING
Agriculture is an age-old economic activity in
our country. Over these years, cultivation
methods have changed significantly depending
upon the characteristics of physical
environment, technological know-how and
socio-cultural practices. Farming varies from
subsistence to commercial type. At present,
in different parts of India, the following
farming systems are practised.
Primitive Subsistence Farming
This type of farming is still practised in few
pockets of India. Primitive subsistence
agriculture is practised on small patches of
land with the help of primitive tools like hoe,
dao and digging sticks, and family/
community labour. This type of farming
depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of
the soil and suitability of other environmental
conditions to the crops grown.
It is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.
Farmers clear a patch of land and produce
cereals and other food crops to sustain their
family. When the soil fertility decreases, the
farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land
for cultivation. This type of shifting allows
Nature to replenish the fertility of the soil
through natural processes; land productivity
in this type of agriculture is low as the farmer
does not use fertilisers or other modern
inputs. It is known by different names in
different parts of the country.
Can you name  some such types of farmings?
It is jhumming in north-eastern states like
Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland;
Pamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district
of Chhattishgarh, and in Andaman and
Nicobar Islands.
Jhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture
is known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central
America, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in
Brazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’
in Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam.
In India, this primitive form of cultivation
is called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya
Pradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh,
‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha,
‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’
in South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the
Himalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and
‘Jhumming’ in the North-eastern region.

Can you name the type of farming Rinjha’s
family is engaged in?
Can you enlist some crops which are grown
in such farming?
Intensive Subsistence Farming
This type of farming is practised in areas of
high population pressure on land. It is labour-
intensive farming, where high doses of
biochemical inputs and irrigation are used
for obtaining higher production.
Can you name some of the states of India
where such farming is practised?
Though the ‘right of inheritance’ leading
to the division of land among successive
generations has rendered land-holding size
uneconomical, the farmers continue to take
maximum output from the limited land in
the absence of alternative source of livelihood.
Thus, there is enormous pressure on
agricultural land.
Commercial Farming
The main characteristic of this type of farming
is the use of higher doses of modern inputs,
e.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical
fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order
to obtain higher productivity. The degree of
commercialisation of agriculture varies from
one region to another. For example, rice is a
commercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but
in Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.
Can you give some more examples of crops
which may be commercial in one region and
may provide subsistence in another region?
Plantation is also a type of commercial
farming. In this type of farming, a single crop
is grown on a large area. The plantation has
an interface of agriculture and industry.
Plantations cover large tracts of land, using
capital intensive inputs, with the help of
migrant labourers. All the produce is used
as raw material in respective industries.
In India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane,
banana, etc., are important plantation crops.
Tea in Assam and North Bengal coffee in
Karnataka are some of the important
plantation crops grown in these states. Since
the production is mainly for market, a well-
developed network of transport and
communication connecting the plantation
areas, processing industries and markets
plays an important role in the development
of plantations.
Rinjha lived with her family in a small village
at the outskirts of Diphu in Assam. She enjoys
watching her family members clearing,
slashing and burning a patch of land for
cultivation. She often helps them in irrigating
the fields with water running through a
bamboo canal from the nearby spring. She
loves the surroundings and wants to stay
here as long as she can, but this little girl
has no idea about the declining fertility of
the soil and her family’s search for fresh a
patch of land in the next season.

CROPPING PATTERN
You have studied the physical diversities and
plurality of cultures in India. These are also
reflected in agricultural practices and
cropping patterns in the country. Various
types of food and fibre crops, vegetables and
fruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute
some of the important crops grown in the
country. India has three cropping seasons
— rabi, kharif and zaid.
Rabi crops are sown in winter from October
to December and harvested in summer from
April to June. Some of the important rabi
crops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and
mustard. Though, these crops are grown in
large parts of India, states from the north
and north-western parts such as Punjab,
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and
Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are
important for the production of wheat and
other rabi crops. Availability of precipitation
during winter months due to the western
temperate cyclones helps in the success of
these crops. However, the success of the green
revolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar
Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been
an important factor in the growth of the above-
mentioned rabi crops.
Kharif crops are grown with the onset of
monsoon in different parts of the country and
these are harvested in September-October.
Important crops grown during this season
are paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar),
moong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and
soyabean. Some of the most important rice-
growing regions are Assam, West Bengal,
coastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,
Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and
Maharashtra,  particularly the (Konkan coast)
along with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently,
paddy has also become an important crop of
Punjab and Haryana. In states like Assam,
West Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy
are grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman
and Boro.
In between the rabi and the kharif seasons,
there is a short season during the summer
months known as the Zaid season. Some of
the crops produced during ‘zaid’ are
watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber,
vegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes
almost a year to grow.
Major Crops
A variety of food and non food crops are
grown in different parts of the country
depending upon the variations in soil, climate
and cultivation practices. Major crops grown
in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea,
coffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute,
etc.
Rice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of
the people in India. Our country is the second
largest producer of rice in the world after
China. It is a kharif crop which requires high
temperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity
with annual rainfall above 100 cm. In the areas
of less rainfall, it grows with the help of
irrigation.

Rice is grown in the plains of north and
north-eastern India, coastal areas and the
deltaic regions. Development of dense network
of canal irrigation and tubewells have made
it possible to grow rice in areas of less rainfall
such as Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar
Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan.
Wheat: This is the second most important
cereal crop. It is the main food crop, in north
and north-western part of the country. This
rabi crop requires a cool growing season and
a bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It
requires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenly-
distributed over the growing season. There
are two important wheat-growing zones in the
country – the Ganga-Satluj plains in the
north-west and black soil region of the Deccan.
The major wheat-producing states are
Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.
Millets: Jowar, bajra and ragi are the
important millets grown in India. Though,
these are known as coarse grains, they have
very high nutritional value. For example, ragi
is very rich in iron, calcium, other micro
nutrients and roughage. Jowar is the third
most important food crop with respect to area
and production. It is a rain-fed crop mostly
grown in the moist areas which hardly needs
irrigation. Major Jowar producing States are
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh
and Madhya Pradesh.
Fig. 4.6:  Bajra Cultivation
Bajra grows well on sandy soils and
shallow black soil. Major Bajra producing
States are Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana. Ragi is
a crop of dry regions and grows well on red,
black, sandy, loamy and shallow black soils.
Major ragi producing states are: Karnataka,
Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Sikkim, Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh.
Maize: It is a crop which is used both as
food and fodder. It is a kharif crop which
requires temperature between 21°C to 27°C
and grows well in old alluvial soil. In some
states like Bihar maize is grown in rabi season
also. Use of modern inputs such as HYV
seeds, fertilisers and irrigation have
contributed to the increasing production of
maize. Major maize-producing states are
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

after China. Different oil seeds are grown
covering approximately 12 per cent of the total
cropped area of the country. Main oil-seeds
produced in India are groundnut, mustard,
coconut, sesamum (til), soyabean, castor
seeds, cotton seeds, linseed and sunflower.
Most of these are edible and used as cooking
mediums. However, some of these are also
used as raw material in the production of
soap, cosmetics and ointments.
Groundnut is a kharif crop and accounts
for about half of the major oilseeds produced in
the country. Gujarat was the largest producer
of groundnut followed by Rajasthan and Tamil
Nadu in 2019–20. Linseed and mustard are rabi
crops. Sesamum is a kharif crop in north and
rabi crop in south India. Castor seed is grown
both as rabi and kharif crop.

tur (arhar), urad, moong, masur, peas and
gram. Can you distinguish which of these
pulses are grown in the kharif season and
which are grown in the rabi season? Pulses
need less moisture and survive even in dry
conditions. Being leguminous crops, all these
crops except arhar help in restoring soil
fertility by fixing nitrogen from the air.
Therefore, these are mostly grown in rotation
with other crops. Major pulse producing states
in India  are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka.

It was mentioned in the previous pages that
agriculture has been practised in India for
thousands of years. Sustained uses of land
without compatible techno-institutional
changes have hindered the pace of agricultural
development. Inspite of development of sources
of irrigation most of the farmers in large parts
of the country still depend upon monsoon and
natural fertility in order to carry on their
agriculture. For a growing population, this
poses a serious challenge. Agriculture which
provides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of
its population, needs some serious technical
and 
institutional 
reforms. 
Thus,
collectivisation, consolidation of holdings,
cooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc.
were given priority to bring about institutional
reforms in the country after Independence.
‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First
Five Year Plan. The right of inheritance had
already led to fragmentation of land holdings
necessitating consolidation of holdings.
The laws of land reforms were enacted but
the implementation was lacking or lukewarm.
The Government of India embarked upon
introducing agricultural reforms to improve
Indian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.
The Green Revolution based on the use of
package technology and the White Revolution
(Operation Flood) were some of the strategies
initiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.
But, this too led to the concentration of
development in few selected areas. Therefore,
in the 1980s and 1990s, a comprehensive land
development programme was initiated, which
included both institutional and technical

schemes introduced by the Government of  India
for the benefit of the farmers. Moreover, special
weather bulletins and agricultural programmes
for farmers were introduced on the radio and
television. The government also announces
minimum support price, remunerative and
procurement prices for important crops to check
the exploitation of farmers by speculators and
middlemen.
Bhoodan – Gramdan
Mahatma Gandhi declared Vinoba Bhave as
his spiritual heir. He also participated in
Satyagraha as one of the foremost
satyagrahis. He was one of the votaries of
Gandhi’s concept of gram swarajya. After
Gandhiji’s martyrdom, Vinoba Bhave
undertook padyatra to spread Gandhiji’s
message covered almost the entire country.
Once, when he was delivering a lecture at
Pochampalli in Andhra Pradesh, some poor
landless villagers demanded some land for
their economic well-being. Vinoba Bhave
could not promise it to them immediately but
assured them to talk to the Government of
India regarding provision of land for them if
they undertook cooperative farming.
Suddenly, Shri Ram Chandra Reddy stood
up and offered 80 acres of land to be
distributed among 80 land-less villagers.
This act was known as ‘Bhoodan’. Later he
travelled and introduced his ideas widely all
over India. Some zamindars, owners of
many villages offered to distribute some
villages among the landless. It was known
as Gramdan. However, many land-owners
chose to provide some part of their land to
the poor farmers due to the fear of land
ceiling act. This Bhoodan-Gramdan
movement initiated by Vinoba Bhave is also
known as the Blood-less Revolution.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
CHAPTER 3 : MONEY AND CREDIT
Money is a fascinating subject and full of
curiosities. It is important to capture this
element for the students. The history of
money and how various forms were used at
different times is an interesting story. At this
stage the purpose is to allow students to
realise the social situation in which these
forms were used. Modern forms of money are
linked to the banking system. This is the
central idea of the first part of the chapter.
The present situation in India, where
newer forms of money are slowly spreading
with computerisation of the banking system,
offers many opportunities to students to
explore on their own. We need not get into a
formal discussion of the ‘functions of money’
but let it come up as questions. There are
certain areas that are not covered, such as
‘creation of money’ (money multiplier) or the
backing of the modern system that may be
discussed if you desire.
As you would see in the chapter, the stock
of money consists of currency held by the
public and the demand deposits that they hold
with the banks. This is the money that people
can use as they wish and the government has
to ensure that the system works smoothy.
What would happen when the government
declares that some of the currency notes used
by people would be made invalid and would be
replaced by new currency? In India, during
November 2016, currency notes in the
denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 were
declared invalid. People were asked to
surrender these notes to the bank by a specific
period and receive new Rs. 500, Rs. 2,000 or
other currency notes. This is known as
‘demonetisation’. Since then, people were also
encouraged to use their bank deposits rather
than cash for transactions. Hence, digital
transactions started by using bank-to-bank
transfer through the internet or mobile
phones, cheques, ATM cards, credit cards,
and Point of Sale (POS) swipe machines at
shops. This is promoted to reduce the
requirement of cash for transactions and also
control corruption. Students could be asked
to debate on the process and the impact of
demonetisation. They can be guided to make
a collage of the major areas where people use
digital and cash transactions which are
legitimate and legal. They can also discuss the
transactions which are legal and why. It is also
important to intimate students that different
types of plastic cards are used in place of cash
transactions but not all of them money per se.
Credit is a crucial element in economic
life and it is, therefore, important to first
understand this in a conceptual manner.
What are the aspects that one looks at in
any credit arrangement and how this affects
people is the main focus of the second part
of the chapter. The world around us offers a
tremendous variety of such arrangements
and it would be ideal to explain these
aspects of credit from situations that are
familiar to your students. The other crucial
issue of credit is its availability to all,
especially the poor, and on reasonable
terms. We need to emphasise that this is a
right of the people and without which a large
section of them would be kept out of the
development process. There are many
innovative interventions, such as that of
Grameen Bank, of which students may be
made familiar with but it is important to
realise that we don’t have answers to all
questions. We need to find new ways and
this is one of the social challenges that
developing countries face.

The use of money spans a very large
part of our everyday life. Look around
you and you would easily be able to
identify several transactions involving
money in any single day. Can you
make a list of these? In many of these
transactions, goods are being bought
and sold with the use of money. In
some of these transactions, services
are being exchanged with money.  For
some, there might not be any actual
transfer of money taking place now
but a promise to pay money later.
Have you ever wondered why
transactions are made in
money? The reason is simple.
A person holding money can easily
exchange it for any commodity or
service that he or she might want.
Thus everyone  prefers to receive
payments in money and then
exchange the money for things that
they want.  Take the case of a shoe
manufacturer. He wants to sell shoes
in the market and buy wheat.  The
shoe manufacturer will first exchange
shoes that he has produced for
money, and then exchange the money
for wheat. Imagine how much more
difficult it would be if the shoe
manufacturer had to directly
exchange shoes for wheat without the
use of money. He would have to look
for a wheat growing farmer who not
only wants to sell wheat
but also wants to buy the
shoes 
in 
exchange.
That is, both parties
have to agree to
sell and buy each
others commodities.
This is known as
double coincidence
of wants. What a person
desires to sell is exactly what the
other wishes to buy. In a barter
system where goods are directly
exchanged without the use of money,
double coincidence of wants is an
essential feature.
In contrast, in an economy where
money is in use, money by providing
the crucial intermediate step
eliminates the need for double
coincidence of wants. It is no longer
necessary for the shoe manufacturer
to look for a farmer who will buy his
shoes and at the same time sell him

We have seen that money is
something that can act as a medium
of exchange in transactions.  Before
the introduction of coins, a variety of
objects was used as money. For
example, since the very early ages,
Indians used  grains and cattle as
money. Thereafter came the use of
metallic coins — gold, silver, copper
coins — a phase which continued well
into the last century.
Currency
Modern forms of money include
currency — paper notes and coins.
Unlike the things that were used as
money earlier, modern currency is not
made of precious metal such as gold,
silver and copper.  And unlike grain
and cattle, they are neither of
everyday use. The modern currency
is without any use of its own.
Then, why is it accepted as a
medium of exchange?  It is accepted
as a medium of exchange because the
currency is authorised by the
government of the country.
In India, the Reserve Bank of India
issues currency notes on behalf of the
central government. As per Indian
law, no other individual or
organisation is allowed to issue
currency. Moreover, the law legalises
the use of rupee as a medium of
payment that cannot be refused in
settling transactions in India. No
individual in India can legally refuse
a payment made in rupees. Hence,
the rupee is widely accepted as a
medium of exchange.
Deposits with Banks
The other form in which people hold
money is as deposits with banks. At
a point of time, people need only some
currency  for their day-to-day needs.
For instance, workers who receive
their salaries at the end of each month
have extra cash at the beginning of
the month. What do people do with
this extra cash? They deposit it with
the banks by opening a bank
account in their name. Banks accept
the deposits and also pay an amount
as interest on the deposits. In this way
people’s money is safe with the
banks and it earns an amount as
interest.  People also have the
provision to withdraw the money as
and when they require. Since the
deposits in the bank accounts can be
withdrawn on demand, these
deposits are called demand deposits.
1. How does the use of money make it easier to exchange things?
2. Can you think of some examples of goods / services being exchanged or wages being
paid through barter?

market. Since money acts as an
intermediate in the exchange process,
it is called a medium of exchange.

Cheque Payments
A shoe manufacturer, M. Salim has to make a payment to the leather supplier and writes
a cheque for a specific amount. This means that the shoe manufacturer instructs his
bank to pay this amount to the leather supplier. The leather supplier takes this cheque,
and  deposits it in his own account in the bank. The money is transferred from one bank
account to another bank account in a couple of days. The transaction is complete without
any payment of cash.
Thus we see that demand deposits
share the essential features of money.
The facility of cheques against demand
deposits makes it possible to directly
settle payments without the use of cash.
Since demand deposits are accepted
widely as a means of payment, along
with currency, they constitute money
in the modern economy.
You must remember the role that
the banks play here. But for the
banks, there would be no demand
deposits and no payments by
cheques against these deposits.  The
modern forms of money — currency
and deposits — are closely linked to
the working of the modern banking
system.

Coding used by banks
Cheque number
Demand deposits offer another
interesting facility. It is this facility
which lends it the essential
characteristics of money (that of a
medium of exchange). You would
have heard of payments being
made by cheques instead of cash.
For payment through cheque, the
payer who has an account with the
bank, makes out a cheque for a
specific amount. A cheque is a
paper instructing the bank to pay
a specific amount from the
person’s account to the person in
whose name the cheque has been
issued.

Let us take the story of banks
further. What do the banks do with
the deposits which they accept from
the public? There is an interesting
mechanism at work here. Banks keep
only a small proportion of their
deposits as cash with themselves.  For
example, banks in India these days
hold about 5 per cent of their
deposits as cash. This is kept as
provision to pay the depositors who
might come to withdraw money from
the bank on any given day. Since, on
any particular day, only some of its
many depositors come to withdraw
cash, the bank is able to manage with
this cash.
Banks use the major portion of the
deposits to extend loans.  There is a
huge demand for loans for various
economic activities. We shall read more
about this in the following sections.
Banks make use of the deposits to
meet the loan requirements of the
people.  In this way, banks mediate
between those who have surplus
funds (the depositors) and those who
are in need of these funds (the
borrowers). Banks charge a higher
interest rate on loans than what they
offer on deposits. The difference
between what is charged from
borrowers and what is paid to
depositors is their main source of
income.

A large number of transactions in our day-to-day activities
involve credit in some form or the other. Credit (loan) refers to
an agreement in which the lender supplies the borrower with
money, goods or services in return for the promise of future
payment. Let us see how credit works through the following
two examples.
(1) Festival Season
(1) Festival Season

(1) Festival Season
It is festival season two months from now
and the shoe manufacturer, Salim, has
received an order from a large trader in
town for 3,000 pairs of shoes to be
delivered in a month time. To complete
production on time, Salim has to hire a few
more workers for stitching and pasting
work. He has to purchase the raw
materials. To meet these expenses, Salim
obtains loans from two sources. First, he
asks the leather supplier to supply leather
now and promises to pay him later.
Second, he obtains loan in cash from the
large trader as advance payment for
1000 pairs of shoes with a promise to
deliver the whole order by the end of the
month.
At the end of the month, Salim is able to
deliver the order, make a good profit, and
repay the money that he had borrowed.

TWO DIFFERENT CREDIT SITUATIONS
In this case, Salim obtains credit to meet the working
capital needs of production. The credit helps him to meet the
ongoing expenses of production, complete production on time,
and thereby increase his earnings. Credit therefore plays a
vital and positive role in this situation.
Swapna, a small farmer, grows groundnut on her three
acres of land. She takes a loan from the moneylender
to meet the expenses of cultivation, hoping that her
harvest would help repay the loan. Midway through
the season the crop is hit by pests and the crop
fails. Though Swapna sprays  her crops with
expensive pesticides, it makes little difference. She
is unable to repay the moneylender and the debt
grows over the year into a large amount. Next
year, Swapna takes a fresh loan for cultivation.
It is a normal crop this year. But the earnings
are not enough to cover the old loan.
She is caught in debt. She has to sell
a part of the land to pay off the debt.

TERMS OF CREDIT
Every loan agreement specifies an
interest rate which the borrower must
pay to the lender along with the
In rural areas, the main demand
for credit is for crop production. Crop
production involves considerable
costs on seeds, fertilisers, pesticides,
water, electricity, repair of equipment,
etc. There is a minimum stretch of
three to four months between the time
when the farmers buy these inputs
and when they sell the crop. Farmers
usually take crop loans at the
beginning of the season and repay the
loan after harvest. Repayment of the
loan is crucially dependent on the
income from farming.
1. Fill the following table.
2. Supposing Salim continues to get orders from traders. What would be
his position after 6 years?
3. What are the reasons that make Swapna’s situation so risky? Discuss
factors – pesticides; role of moneylenders; climate.

In Swapna’s case, the failure of the

impossible. She had to sell part of the
land to repay the loan. Credit, instead
of helping Swapna improve her
earnings, left her worse off. This is an
example of what is commonly called
debt-trap. Credit in this case pushes
the borrower into a situation from
which recovery is very painful.
In one situation credit helps to
increase earnings and therefore the
person is better off than before. In
another situation, because of the
crop failure, credit
pushes the person into
a debt trap. To repay
her loan she has to sell
a portion of her land.
She is clearly much
worse off than before.

addition, lenders may demand
collateral (security) against loans.
Collateral is an asset that the
borrower owns (such as land,
building, vehicle, livestocks,
deposits with banks) and  uses this
as a guarantee to a lender until
the loan is repaid. If the borrower
fails to repay the loan, the lender has
the right to sell the asset or collateral
to obtain payment. Property such as
land titles, deposits with banks,
livestock are some common examples
of collateral used for borrowing.

SSSSShyamal tells us that every season he needs
loans for cultivation on his 1.5 acres of land. Till
a few years back, he would borrow money from
the village moneylender at an interest rate of
five per cent per month (60% per annum).
For the last few years, Shyamal has been
borrowing from an agricultural trader in the
village at an interest rate of three per cent
per month. At the beginning of the cropping
season, the trader supplies the farm inputs on
credit, which is  to be repaid when the crops
are ready for harvest.
Besides the interest charge on the loan, the
trader also makes the farmers promise to
sell the crop to him. This way the trader
can ensure that the money is repaid
promptly. Also, since the crop prices are low
after the harvest, the trader is able to
make a profit from buying the crop at a low
price from the farmers and then selling it
later when the price has risen.

Rohit and Ranjan had finished reading about the terms of credit in class.
They were eager to know the various credit arrangements that existed in
their area: who were the people who provided credit? Who were the
borrowers? What were the terms of credit? They decided to talk to some
people in their village.  Read what they record...
15th Nov, 2019.
We head directly for the fields where most farmers and
labourers would be working at this time of the day. The fields
are planted with potato crops. We first meet Shyamal, a small
farmer in Sonpur, a small irrigated village.
WWWWWe next meet Arun who is supervising the
work of one farm labourer. Arun has seven
acres of land. He is one of the few persons
in Sonpur to receive bank loan for
cultivation. The interest rate on the  loan
is 8.5 per cent per annum, and can be repaid
anytime in the next three years.  Arun plans
to repay the loan after harvest by selling a
part of the crop. He then intends to store
the rest of the potatoes in a cold storage
and  apply for a fresh loan from the bank
against the cold storage receipt. The bank
offers this facility to farmers who have
taken crop loan from them.
RRRRRama is working in a neighbouring field. She
works as an agricultural labourer. There are
several months in the year when Rama has
no work, and needs credit to meet the daily
expenses. Expenses on sudden illnesses or
functions in the family are also met through
loans. Rama has to depend on her employer,
a medium landowner in Sonpur, for credit.
The landowner charges an interest rate of
5 per cent per month. Rama repays the
money by working for the landowner. Most
of the time, Rama has to take a fresh loan,
before the previous loan has been repaid.
At present, she owes the landowner
Rs 5,000. Though the landowner doesn’t
treat her well, she continues to work for him
since she can get loans from him when in
need. Rama tells us that the only source of
credit for the landless people in Sonpur are
the landowner-employers.

cooperatives).  Members of a cooperative pool their
resources for cooperation in certain areas. There are
several types of cooperatives possible such as
farmers cooperatives, weavers cooperatives,
industrial workers cooperatives, etc. Krishak
Cooperative functions in a village not very far away
from Sonpur. It has 2300 farmers as members. It
accepts deposits from its members. With these
deposits as collateral, the Cooperative has obtained
a large loan from the bank. These funds are used to
provide loans to members. Once these loans are
repaid, another round of lending can take place.
Krishak Cooperative provides loans for the purchase
of agricultural implements, loans for cultivation
and agricultural trade, fishery loans, loans for
construction of houses and for a variety of other
expenses.

rate, etc.

choose. There is no one to stop them
from using unfair means to get their
money back.
Compared to the formal lenders,
most of the informal lenders charge a
much higher interest on loans. Thus,
the cost to the borrower of informal
loans is much higher.
Higher cost of borrowing means a
larger part of the earnings of the
borrowers is used to repay the loan.
Hence, borrowers have less income
left for themselves (as we saw for
Shyamal in Sonpur). In certain
cases, the high interest rate for
borrowing can mean that the amount
to be repaid is greater than the
income of the borrower. This could
lead to increasing debt (as we saw for
Rama in Sonpur) and debt trap. Also,
people who might wish to start an
enterprise by borrowing may not do
so because of the high cost of
borrowing.
For these reasons, banks and
cooperative societies need to lend
more. This would lead to higher in-
comes and many people could then
borrow cheaply for a variety
of needs. They could grow crops,
do business, set up small-scale indus-
tries etc. They could set up new indus-
tries or trade in goods. Cheap and
affordable credit is crucial for the
country’s development.
Formal and Informal Credit:
Who gets what?
Graph 2 shows the importance of
formal and informal sources of credit
for people in urban areas.  The people
are divided into four groups, from poor
to rich, as shown in the figure. You can
see that 54 per cent of the loans taken
by poor households in the urban areas
are from informal sources. Compare
this with the rich urban households.
What do you find? Only 17 per cent of
their loans are from informal sources,
while 83 per cent are from formal
sources. A similar pattern is also found
in rural areas. The rich households are
availing cheap credit from formal
lenders whereas the poor households
have to pay a large amount for
borrowing.
What does all this suggest? First,
the formal sector still meets only about
half of the total credit needs of the
rural people. The remaining credit
needs are met from informal sources.

Most loans from informal lenders
carry a very high interest rate and do
little to increase the income of the
borrowers. Thus, it is necessary
that banks and cooperatives
increase their lending particularly
in the rural areas, so that the
dependence on informal sources
of credit reduces.
1. What are the differences between formal and informal sources of credit?
2. Why should credit at reasonable rates be available for all?
3. Should there be a supervisor, such as the Reserve Bank of India, that looks into the
loan activities of informal lenders? Why would its task be quite difficult?
4. Why do you think that the share of formal sector credit is higher for the richer households
compared to the poorer households?
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
SELF-HELP GROUPS FOR THE POOR
Secondly, while formal sector
loans need to expand, it is also
necessary that everyone receives
these loans. At present, it is the richer
households who receive formal credit
whereas the poor have to depend on
the informal sources. It is important
that the formal credit is distributed
more equally so that the poor can
benefit from the cheaper loans.
In the previous section we have seen
that poor households are still
dependent on informal sources of
credit. Why is it so? Banks are not
present everywhere in rural India.
Even when they are present, getting a
loan from a bank is much more
difficult than taking a loan from
informal sources. As we saw for
Megha, bank loans require proper
documents and collateral. Absence of
collateral is one of the major reasons
which prevents the poor from getting
bank loans. Informal lenders such as
moneylenders, on the other hand,
know the borrowers personally and
hence are often willing to give a
loan without collateral. The borrowers
can, if necessary, approach the
moneylenders even without repaying

their earlier loans. However, the
moneylenders charge very high rates
of interest, keep no records of the
transactions and harass the poor
borrowers.
In recent years, people have tried
out some newer ways of providing
loans to the poor. The idea is to
organise rural poor, in particular
women, into small Self Help Groups
(SHGs) and pool (collect) their
savings. A typical SHG has 15-20
members, usually belonging to one
neighbourhood, who meet and save
regularly. Saving per member varies
from Rs 25 to Rs 100 or more,
depending on the ability of the people
to save. Members can take small loans
from the group itself to meet their
needs. The group charges interest on
these loans but this is still less than
what the moneylender charges. After
a year or two, if the group is regular
in savings, it becomes eligible for
availing loan from the bank.
Loan is sanctioned in the
name of the group and is
meant to create self-
employment opportunities
for the members. For
instance, small loans are
provided to the members for
releasing mortgaged land,
for meeting working capital
needs (e.g. buying seeds,
fertilisers, raw materials
like bamboo and cloth), for
housing materials, for
acquiring assets like sewing
machine, handlooms, cattle,
etc.
Most of the important
decisions regarding the
savings and loan activities
are taken by the group
members. 
The 
group
decides as regards the loans
to be granted — the purpose, amount,
interest to be charged, repayment
schedule etc.  Also, it is the group
which is responsible for the repayment
of the loan. Any case of non-
repayment of loan by any one
member is followed up seriously by
other members in the group. Because
of this feature, banks are willing to
lend to the poor women when
organised in SHGs, even though they
have no collateral as such.
Thus, the SHGs help borrowers
overcome the problem of lack of
collateral. They can get timely loans
for a variety of purposes and at a
reasonable interest rate. Moreover,
SHGs are the building blocks of
organisation of the rural poor. Not
only does it help women to become
financially self-reliant, the regular
meetings of the group provide a
platform to discuss and act on a
variety of social issues such as health,
nutrition, domestic violence, etc.

In this chapter we have looked at the
modern forms of money and how they
are linked with the banking system.
On one side are the depositors who
keep their money in the banks and on
the other side are the borrowers who
take loans from these banks. Economic
activities require loans or credit. Credit,
as we saw can have a positive impact,
or in certain situations make the
borrower worse off.
Credit is available from a variety of
sources. These can be either formal
sources or informal sources. Terms of

the poor people on terms and
conditions that are appropriate and

credit vary substantially between
formal and informal lenders. At
present, it is the richer households
who receive credit from formal sources
whereas the poor have to depend on
the informal sources. It is essential
that the total formal sector credit
increases so that the dependence on
the more expensive informal credit
becomes less. Also, the poor should
get a much greater share of formal
loans from banks, cooperative
societies etc. Both these steps are
important for development.
Grameen Bank of Bangladesh is one of the
biggest success stories in reaching the poor to
meet their credit needs at reasonable rates.
Started in the 1970s as a small project,
Grameen Bank in 2018 had over 9 million
members in about 81,600 villages spread
across Bangladesh. Almost all of the borrowers
are women and belong to poorest sections of
the society. These borrowers have proved that
not only are poor women reliable borrowers, but
that they can start and run a variety of small
income-generating activities successfully.

Most regions of the world are getting increasingly
interconnected. While this interconnectedness
across countries has many dimensions —
cultural, political, social and economic — this
chapter looks at globalisation in a more limited
sense. It defines globalisation as the integration
between countries through foreign trade and
foreign investments by multinational
corporations (MNCs). As you will notice, the more
complex issues of portfolio investment have been
left out.
If we look at the past thirty years or so, we
find that MNCs have been a major force in the
globalisation process connecting distant regions
of the world. Why are the MNCs spreading their
production to other countries and what are the
ways in which they are doing so? The first part
of the chapter discusses this. Rather than
relying on quantitative estimates, the rapid rise
and influence of the MNCs has been shown
through a variety of examples, mainly drawn
from the Indian context. Note that the examples
are an aid to explain a more general point. While
teaching, the emphasis should be on the ideas
and examples are to be used as illustrations.
You can also creatively use comprehension
passages like the one given after Section II to
test and reinforce new concepts.
Integration of production and integration of
markets is a key idea behind understanding the
process of globalisation and its impact. This has
been dealt with at length in this chapter,
highlighting the role of MNCs in the process.  You
have to ensure that the students grasp this idea
with sufficient clarity, before moving on to the
next topic.
Globalisation has been facilitated by several
factors. Three of these have been highlighted:
rapid improvements in technology, liberalisation
of trade and investment policies and, pressures
from international organisations such as the
WTO. Improvement in technology is a fascinating
area for students and you may, with a few
directions, encourage them to do their own
explorations. While discussing liberalisation, you
have to keep in mind that the students are
unaware of what India was like in the
pre-liberalisation era. A role-play could be
conceived to compare and contrast the pre and
post-liberalisation era. Similarly, international
negotiations under WTO and the uneven
balances in power are interesting subjects that
can be covered in a discussion mode rather than
as lectures.
The final section covers the impact of
globalisation. To what extent has globalisation
contributed to the development process? This
section draws on the topics covered in Chapters
1 and 2 (for example, what is a fair development
goal), which you can refer to. Also, examples and
activities drawn from the local environment are
a must while discussing this section. This might
include contexts that have not been covered in
the chapter, such as the impact of imports on
local farmers, etc. Collective brainstorming
sessions can be conducted to analyse such
situations.
Sources for Information
The call for a fairer globalisation has been given,
among others, by the International Labour
Organisation — www.ilo.org. Another interesting
resource is the WTO website http://www.wto.org.
It gives access to the variety of agreements that
are being negotiated at the WTO.  For company
related information, most MNCs have their own
websites.  If you want to critically look at
the MNCs, one recommended website is
www.corporatewatch.org.uk.

CHAPTER 4
As consumers in today’s world, some
of us have a wide choice of goods and
services before us. The latest models
of digital cameras, mobile phones and
televisions made by the leading
manufacturers of the world are within
our reach. Every season, new models
of automobiles can be seen on Indian
roads. Gone are the days when
Ambassador and Fiat were the only
cars on  Indian roads. Today, Indians
are buying cars produced by nearly
all the top companies in the world. A
similar explosion of brands can be
seen for many other goods: from shirts
to televisions to processed fruit juices.
Such wide-ranging choice of goods
in our markets is a relatively recent
phenomenon. You wouldn’t have
found such a wide variety of goods in
Indian markets even two decades
back. In a matter of years, our
markets have been transformed!
How do we understand these
rapid transformations? What are the
factors that are bringing about these
changes? And, how are these changes
affecting the lives of the people?
We shall dwell on these questions in
this chapter.

Until the middle of the twentieth
century, production was largely
organised within countries.  What
crossed the boundaries of these
countries were raw material, food stuff
and finished products. Colonies such
as India exported raw materials and
food stuff and imported finished
goods. Trade was the main channel
connecting distant countries. This was
before large companies called

are assembled and the finished products are sold all over the
world. Meanwhile, the company’s customer care is carried out
through call centres located in India.
PRODUCTION ACROSS COUNTRIES
multinational corporations (MNCs)
emerged on the scene. A MNC is a
company that owns or controls
production in more than one nation.
MNCs set up offices and factories for
production in regions where they can
get cheap labour and other resources.
This is done so that the cost of
production is low and the MNCs can
earn greater profits. Consider the
following example.
This is a call centre in Bengaluru, equipped with telecom facilities and access to
the Internet to provide information and support to customers abroad.

Complete the following statement to show how the production process in the garment
industry is spread across countries.
The brand tag says ‘Made in Thailand’ but they are not Thai products. We dissect
the manufacturing process and look for the best solution at each step. We are
doing it globally. In making garments, the company may, for example, get cotton
fibre from Korea, ........
LET’S WORK THIS OUT
In this example the MNC is not only
selling its finished products globally,
but more important, the goods and
services are produced globally. As
a result, production is organised in
increasingly complex ways.  The
production process is divided into
small parts and spread out across the
globe. In the above example, China
provides the advantage of being a
cheap manufacturing location.
Mexico and Eastern Europe are useful
for their closeness to the markets
in the US and Europe. India has
highly skilled engineers who can
understand the technical aspects of
production. It also has educated
English speaking youth who can
provide customer care services. And
all this probably can mean 50-60 per
cent cost-savings for the MNC!
The advantage of spreading out
production across the borders to the
multinationals can be truly immense.
INTERLINKING PRODUCTION ACROSS
COUNTRIES
At times, MNCs set up production
jointly with some of the local
companies of these countries. The
benefit to the local company of such
joint production is two-fold. First,
MNCs can provide money for
additional investments, like buying
new machines for faster production.
Second, MNCs might bring with them
the latest technology for production.
In general, MNCs set up production
where it is close to the markets; where
there is skilled and unskilled labour
available at low costs; and where the
availability of other factors of
production is assured. In addition,
MNCs might look for government
policies that look after their interests.
You will read more about the policies
later in the chapter.
Having assured themselves of these
conditions, MNCs set up factories and
offices for production. The money that
is spent to buy assets such as land,
building, machines and other
equipment is called investment.
Investment made by MNCs is called
foreign investment. Any investment
is made with the hope that these
assets will earn profits.

But the most common route for
MNC investments is to buy up local
companies and then to expand
production. MNCs with huge wealth
can quite easily do so. To take an
example, Cargill Foods, a very large
American MNC, has bought over
smaller Indian companies such as
Parakh Foods. Parakh Foods had
built a large marketing network in
various parts of India, where its brand
was well-reputed. Also, Parakh Foods
had four oil refineries, whose control
has now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is
now the largest producer of edible oil
in India, with a capacity to make 5
million pouches daily!
In fact, many of the top MNCs
have wealth exceeding the entire
budgets of the developing country
governments. With such enormous
wealth, imagine the power and
influence of these MNCs!
There’s another way in which
MNCs control production. Large
MNCs in developed countries place
orders for production with small
producers. Garments, footwear,
sports items are examples of
industries where production is
carried out by a large number of
small producers around the world.
The products are supplied to the
MNCs, which then sell these under
their own brand names to the
customers. These large MNCs have
tremendous power to determine price,
quality, delivery, and labour
conditions for these distant
producers.
Thus, we see that there are a
variety of ways in which the MNCs are
spreading their production and
interacting with local producers in
various countries across the globe. By
setting up partnerships with local
companies, by using the local
companies for supplies, by closely
competing with the local companies
or buying them up, MNCs are exerting
a strong influence on production
at these distant locations. As a
result, production in these widely
dispersed locations is getting
interlinked.

Read the passage on the left and answer the questions.
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
1. Would you say Ford Motors is a MNC? Why?
2. What is foreign investment? How much did Ford Motors invest in India?
3. By setting up their production plants in India, MNCs such as Ford
Motors tap the advantage not only of the large markets that countries
such as India provide, but also the lower costs of production. Explain
the statement.
4. Why do you think the company wants to develop India as a base for
manufacturing car components for its global operations? Discuss the
following factors:
(a) cost of labour and other resources in India
(b) the presence of several local manufacturers who supply auto-
parts to Ford Motors
(c) closeness to a large number of buyers in India and China
5. In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to
interlinking of production?
6. In what ways is a MNC different from other companies?
7. Nearly all major multinationals are American, Japanese or European,
such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Honda, Nokia. Can you guess why?
For a long time foreign trade has been
the main channel connecting
countries. In history you would have
read about the trade routes
connecting India and South Asia to
markets both in the East and West
and the extensive trade that took
place along these routes. Also, you
would remember that it was trading
interests which attracted various
trading companies such as the East
India Company to India. What then
is the basic function of foreign trade?
To put it simply, foreign trade
creates an opportunity for the
producers to reach beyond the
domestic markets, i.e., markets of their
own countries. Producers can sell their
produce not only in markets located
within the country but can also compete
in markets located in other countries
of the world. Similarly, for the buyers,
import of goods produced in another
country is one way of expanding the
choice of goods beyond what is
domestically produced.
FOREIGN TRADE AND
INTEGRATION OF MARKETS
Ford Motors, an American
company, is one of the
world’s largest automobile
manufacturers with
production spread over 26
countries of the world.
Ford Motors came to India
in 1995 and spent Rs.
1700 crore to set up a
large plant near Chennai.
This was done in
collaboration with
Mahindra and Mahindra,
a major Indian
manufacturer of jeeps and
trucks. By the year 2017,
Ford Motors was selling
88,000 cars in the Indian
markets,
while another 1,81,000
cars were exported from
India to South Africa,
Mexico, Brazil and United
States of America. In recent
years, Ford Company
stopped producing cars for
selling in India but export
cars and car engines on a
small scale to other
countries.

Chinese Toys in India
Chinese manufacturers learn
of an  opportunity to export toys
to India, where toys are sold at
a high price. They start
exporting plastic toys to India.
Buyers in India now have the
option of choosing between
Indian and the Chinese toys.
Because of the cheaper prices
and new designs, Chinese toys
become more popular in the
Indian markets. Within a year,
70 to 80 per cent of the toy
shops have replaced Indian
toys with Chinese toys. Toys
are now cheaper in the Indian
markets than earlier.
Let us see the effect of foreign trade
through the example of Chinese toys
in the Indian markets.
What is happening here? As a
result of trade, Chinese toys
come into the Indian markets.
In the competition between
Indian and Chinese toys,
Chinese toys prove better.
Indian buyers have a greater
choice of toys and at lower
prices. For the Chinese toy
makers, this provides an
opportunity to expand business.
The opposite is true for Indian
toy makers. They face losses,
as their toys are selling
much less.

2. Distinguish between foreign trade and foreign investment.
3. In recent years China has been importing steel from India. Explain how the import
of steel by China will affect.
(a) steel companies in China.
(b) steel companies in India.
(c) industries buying steel for production of other industrial goods in China.
4. How will the import of steel from India into the Chinese markets lead to integration
of markets for steel in the two countries? Explain.
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
In general, with the opening of
trade, goods travel from one market
to another. Choice of goods in the
markets rises. Prices of similar goods
in the two markets tend to become
equal. And, producers in the two
countries now closely compete against
each other even though they are
separated by thousands of miles!
Foreign trade thus results in
connecting the markets or
integration of markets in  different
countries.
In the past two to three decades, more
and more MNCs have been looking for
locations around the world which
would be cheap for their production.
Foreign investment by MNCs in these
countries has been rising.  At the same
time, foreign trade between countries
has been rising rapidly. A large part
of the foreign trade is also controlled
by MNCs. For instance, the car
manufacturing plant of Ford Motors
in India not only produces cars for the
Indian markets, it also exports cars
to other developing countries and
exports car components for its many
factories around the world. Likewise,
activities of most MNCs involve
substantial trade in goods and also
services.

Technology
Rapid improvement in technology has been one major factor that has
stimulated the globalisation process. For instance, the past fifty years have
seen several improvements in transportation technology. This has made much
faster delivery of goods across long distances possible at lower costs.
The result of greater foreign
investment and greater foreign trade
has been greater integration of
production and markets across
countries. Globalisation is this
process of rapid integration or
interconnection between countries.
MNCs are playing a major role in
the globalisation process. More
and more goods and services,
investments and technology are
moving between countries. Most
regions of the world are in closer

contact with each other than a few
decades back.
Besides the movements of goods,
services, investments and technology,
there is one more way in which the
countries can be connected. This is
through the movement of people
between countries. People usually
move from one country to another in
search of better income, better jobs or
better education. In the past few
decades, however, there has not been
much increase in the movement of
people between countries due to
various restrictions.
Containers for
transport of goods
Goods are placed in containers
that can be loaded intact onto
ships, railways, planes and trucks.
Containers have led to huge
reduction in port handling costs
and increased the speed with
which exports can reach markets.
Similarly, the cost of air transport
has fallen.  This has enabled much
greater volumes of goods being
transported by airlines.

Liberalisation of foreign trade
and foreign investment
policy
Let us return to the example of imports
of Chinese toys in India. Suppose the
Indian government puts a tax on
import of toys. What would happen?
Those who wish to import these toys
would have to pay tax on this. Because
of the tax, buyers will have to pay a
higher price on imported toys. Chinese
toys will no longer be as cheap  in the
Indian markets and imports from
China will automatically reduce.
Indian toy-makers will prosper.
Tax on imports is an example of
trade barrier. It is called a barrier
because some restriction has been set
up. Governments can use trade
barriers to increase or decrease
(regulate) foreign trade and to decide
what kinds of goods and how much
of each, should come into the country.
The Indian government, after
Independence, had put barriers to
foreign trade and foreign investment.
This was considered necessary to
protect the producers within the
country  from foreign competition.
Industries were just coming up in the
1950s and 1960s, and competition
from imports at that stage would not
have allowed these industries to come
up. Thus, India allowed imports
of only essential items such as
machinery, fertilisers, petroleum
etc. Note that all developed
countries, during the early stages of
development, have given protection to
domestic producers through a variety
of means.
Starting around 1991, some far-
reaching changes in policy were made
in India.  The government decided that
the time had come for Indian
producers to compete with producers
around the globe. It felt that
competition would improve the
performance of producers within the
country since they would have to
improve their quality. This decision
was 
supported 
by 
powerful
international organisations.
Thus, barriers on foreign trade and
foreign investment were removed to a
large extent. This meant that goods
could be imported and exported
easily and also foreign companies
could set up factories and offices
here.
Removing barriers or restrictions
set by the government is what is
known as liberalisation. With
liberalisation of trade, businesses are
allowed to make decisions freely
about what they wish to import or
export. The government imposes
much less restrictions than before
and is therefore said to be more
liberal.
1. What do you understand by liberalisation of foreign trade?
2. Tax on imports is one type of trade barrier. The government could also place a limit on
the number of goods that can be imported. This is known as quotas.  Can you explain,
using the example of Chinese toys, how quotas can be used as trade barriers?
Do you think this should be used? Discuss.

developed countries, WTO establishes
rules regarding international trade,
and sees that these rules are obeyed.
About 160 countries of the world are
currently members of the WTO.
Though WTO is supposed to allow
free trade for all, in practice, it is seen
that the developed countries have
unfairly retained trade barriers. On
the other hand, WTO rules have forced
the developing countries to remove
trade barriers. An example of this is
the current debate on trade in
agricultural products.
We have seen that the liberalisation
of foreign trade and investment in
India was supported by some very
powerful international organisations.
These organisations say that all
barriers to foreign trade and
investment are harmful. There
should be no barriers. Trade
between countries should be ‘free’.
All countries in the world should
liberalise their policies.
World Trade Organisation (WTO) is
one such organisation whose aim is
to liberalise international trade.

Developing countries are, therefore, asking the

You have seen in Chapter 2, that the
agriculture sector provides the bulk
of employment and a significant
portion of the GDP in India.
Compare this to a developed
country such as the US with the
share of agriculture in GDP at 1%
and its share in total employment
a tiny 0.5%! And yet this very
small percentage of people
who 
are 
engaged 
in
agriculture in the US  receive
massive sums of money from
the US government for
production and for exports to
other countries. Due to this
massive money that they
receive, US farmers can sell
the 
farm 
products 
at
abnormally low prices. The
surplus farm products are
sold in other country markets
at low prices, adversely
affecting farmers in these
countries.
A typical cotton farm in USA consists of thousands of acres owned by
a huge corporation that will sell cotton abroad at lowered prices.

In the last twenty years, globalisation
of the Indian economy has come a
long way. What has been its effect on
the lives of people? Let us look at
some of the evidence.
Globalisation 
and 
greater
competition among producers - both
local and foreign producers - has been
of advantage to consumers,
particularly the well-off sections in the
urban areas. There is greater choice
before these consumers who now
enjoy improved quality and lower
prices for several products. As a result,
these people today, enjoy much
higher standards of living than was
possible earlier.
Among producers and workers,
the impact of globalisation has not
been uniform.
Firstly, MNCs have increased their
investments in India over the past 20
years, which means investing in India
has been beneficial for them. MNCs
have been interested in industries
such as cell phones, automobiles,
electronics, soft drinks, fast food or
services such as banking in urban
areas. These products have a large
number of well-off  buyers. In these
industries and services, new jobs have
been created. Also, local companies
supplying raw materials, etc. to these
industries have prospered.

to provide protection to their producers.
2. What do you think can be done so that trade between countries is more fair?
3. In the above example, we saw that the US government gives massive sums of money
to farmers for production. At times, governments also give support  to promote production
of certain types of goods, such as those which are environmentally friendly. Discuss
whether these are fair or not.

are some Indian companies which
are spreading their operations
worldwide.
Globalisation has also created
new opportunities for companies
providing services, particularly those
involving IT. The Indian company
producing a magazine for the London
based company and call centres are
some examples.  Besides, a host of
services such as data entry, account-
ing, administrative tasks, engineering
are now being done cheaply in
countries such as India and are
exported to the developed countries.
Secondly, several of the top Indian
companies have been able to benefit
from the increased competition. They
have invested in newer technology and
production methods and raised their
production standards. Some have
gained from successful collaborations
with foreign companies.
Moreover, globalisation has
enabled some large Indian companies
to emerge as multinationals
themselves! Tata Motors (auto-
mobiles), Infosys (IT), Ranbaxy
(medicines), Asian Paints (paints),
Sundaram Fasteners (nuts and bolts)

The setting of SEZs has been opposed by some people in India. Find out who are
these people and why are they opposing it.
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
In recent years, the central and state
governments in India are taking special
steps to attract foreign companies to
invest in India. Industrial zones, called
Special Economic Zones (SEZs), are
being set up. SEZs are to have world class
facilities: electricity, water, roads,
transport, storage, recreational and
educational facilities. Companies who set
up production units in the SEZs do not
have to pay taxes for an initial period of
five years.
Government has also allowed
flexibility in the labour laws to attract
foreign investment. You have seen in
Chapter 2 that the companies in the
organised sector have to obey certain
rules that aim to protect the workers’
rights. In the recent years, the government
has allowed companies to ignore many of
these. Instead of hiring workers on a
regular basis, companies hire workers
‘flexibly’ for short periods when there is
intense pressure of work. This is done to
reduce the cost of labour for the company.
However, still not satisfied, foreign
companies are demanding more flexibility
in labour laws.

Small producers: Compete or perish
For a large number of small producers and
workers globalisation has posed major
challenges.
Batteries, capacitors, plastics, toys, tyres, dairy products, and
vegetable oil are some examples of industries where the small
manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition. Several of
the units have shut down rendering many workers jobless. The
small and medium industries in India employ the largest number
of workers (11 crores) in the country, next only to agriculture.
1. What are the ways in which Ravi’s small production unit was affected by rising competition?
2. Should producers such as Ravi stop production because their cost of production is higher compared to
producers in other countries? What do you think?
3. Recent studies point out that small producers in India need three things to compete better in the market
(a) better roads, power, water, raw materials, marketing and information network (b) improvements and
modernisation of technology (c) timely availability of credit at reasonable interest rates.

used to buy different components
including capacitors in bulk for the
manufacture of television sets.
However, competition from the MNC
brands forced the Indian television
companies to move into assembling
activities for MNCs. Even when some
of them bought capacitors, they would
prefer to import as the price of the
imported item was half the price
charged by people like Ravi.
Ravi now produces less than half the
capacitors that he produced in the year
2000 and has only seven workers
working for him. Many of Ravi’s friends
in the same business in Hyderabad
and Chennai have closed their units.
Ravi did not expect that he would have
to face a crisis in such a short period
of his life as industrialist. Ravi took a
loan from the bank to start his own
company producing capacitors in 1992
in Hosur, an industrial town in Tamil
Nadu. Capacitors are used in many
electronic home appliances including
tube lights, television etc.  Within three
years, he was able to expand
production and had 20 workers
working under him.
His struggle to run his company started
when the government removed
restrictions on  imports of capacitors as
per its agreement at WTO in 2001. His

Competition and Uncertain Employment
 Globalisation and the pressure of competition have substantially changed the lives
of workers. Faced with growing competition, most employers these days prefer to
employ workers ‘flexibly’. This means that workers’ jobs are no longer secure.

35 year old Sushila has spent many
years as a worker in garment export
industry of Delhi. She was employed
as a ‘permanent worker’ entitled to
health insurance, provident fund,
overtime at a double rate, when
Sushila’s factory closed in the late
1990s.  After searching for a job  for
six months, she finally got a job  30
km. away from where she lives. Even
after working in this factory for
several years, she is a temporary
worker and earns less than half of
what she was earning earlier.
Sushila leaves her house every
morning, seven days a week at 7:30
a.m. and returns at 10 p.m.  A day
off from work means no wage. She
has none of the benefits she used
to get earlier. Factories closer to her
home have widely fluctuating orders
and therefore pay even less.
Let us see how the workers in the garment export industry
in India are having to bear this pressure of competition.
Large MNCs in the garment industry in
Europe and America order their products
from Indian exporters. These large MNCs
with worldwide network look for the cheapest
goods in order to maximise their profits. To
get these large orders, Indian garment
exporters try hard to cut their own costs. As
cost of raw materials cannot be reduced,
exporters try to cut labour costs. Where
earlier a factory used to employ workers on
a permanent basis, now they employ workers
only on a temporary basis so that they do
not have to pay workers for the whole year.
Workers also have to put in very long
working hours and work night shifts on a
regular basis during the peak season. Wages
are low and workers are forced to work
overtime to make both ends meet.
While this competition among the garment
exporters has allowed the MNCs to make large
profits, workers are denied their fair share of
benefits brought about by globalisation.
Factory workers folding garments for export. Though globalisation has created opportunities for paid work for
women, the condition of employment shows that women are denied their fair share of benefits.

The conditions of work and the hardships of the workers described above
have become common to many industrial units and services in India. Most
workers, today, are employed in the unorganised sector. Moreover, increasingly
conditions of work in the organised sector have come to resemble the
unorganised sector. Workers in the organised sector such as Sushila no longer
get the protection and benefits that they enjoyed earlier.
that labour laws are properly
implemented and the workers get
their rights. It can support small
producers 
to 
improve 
their
performance till the time they become
strong enough to compete. If
necessary, the government can use
trade and investment barriers. It can
negotiate at the WTO for ‘fairer rules’.
It can also align with other developing
countries with similar interests to
fight against the domination of
developed countries in the WTO.
In the past few years, massive
campaigns and  representation by
people’s 
organisations 
have
influenced important decisions
relating to trade and investments at
the WTO. This has demonstrated
that people also can play an
important role in the struggle for fair
globalisation.
The above evidence indicates that
not everyone has benefited from
globalisation. People with education,
skill and wealth have made the best
use of the new opportunities. On the
other hand, there are many people
who have not shared the benefits.
Since globalisation is now a
reality, the question is how to
make globalisation more ‘fair’?
Fair globalisation would create
opportunities for all, and also ensure
that the benefits of globalisation are
shared better.
The government can play a major
role in making this possible. Its
policies must protect the interests, not
only of the rich and the powerful, but
all the people in the country. You have
read about some of the possible steps
that the government can take. For
instance, the government can ensure
1. In what ways has competition affected workers, Indian exporters and foreign MNCs
in the garment industry?
2. What can be done by each of the following so that the workers can get a fair share
of benefits brought by globalisation?
(a) government
(b) employers at the exporting factories
(c) MNCs
(d) workers.
3. One of the present debates in India is whether companies should have flexible
policies for employment. Based on what you have read in the chapter, summarise
the point of view of the employers and workers.

A demonstration against WTO in Hong Kong, 2005
In this chapter, we looked at the
present phase of globalisation.
Globalisation is the process of
rapid integration of countries.
This is happening through
greater foreign trade and foreign
investment. MNCs are playing a
major role in the globalisation
process. More and more MNCs
are looking for locations around
the world that are cheap for their
production. As a result,
production is being organised
in complex ways.
Technology, particularly IT,
has played a big role in
organising production across
countries.  In addition,
liberalisation of trade and
SUMMING UP
investment has facilitated
globalisation by removing
barriers 
to 
trade 
and
investment.  At the inter-
national level, WTO has put
pressure on developing coun-
tries to liberalise trade and
investment.
While globalisation has
benefited well-off consumers
and also producers with skill,
education and wealth, many
small producers and workers
have suffered as a result of the
rising competition.  Fair
globalisation would create
opportunities for all, and also
ensure that the benefits of
globalisation are shared better.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
This chapter proposes to discuss the issue of
consumer rights within the context of the ways
markets operate in our country. There are many
aspects of unequal situations in a market and
poor enforcement of rules and regulations.
Hence, there is a need to sensitise learners and
encourage them to participate in the consumer
movement. This chapter provides case histories
— how some consumers were exploited  in real
life situation and how legal institutions helped
consumers  in getting compensated and in
upholding their rights. The case histories would
enable the students to link these narratives to
their life experiences. We have to enable
students to understand that the awareness of
being a well-informed consumer arose out of
consumer movement and active participation of
people through their struggles over a long
period. This chapter also provides details of a
few organisations helping consumers in different
ways. Finally, it ends with some critical issues
of the consumer movement in India.
Aspects of Teaching / Sources of
Information
This chapter has questions, case studies and
activities. It would be preferred that students
discuss these in groups orally. Some of these
could be answered in writing individually.
While carrying out each activity you could
start with a brainstorming session about the
activity. Similarly, there are many opportunities
for roleplay in this chapter and this could be a
useful way to share their experiences and
understand the issues at a deeper level. Making

posters collectively is another way to think about
these issues. This lesson contains activities,
which require visits — visit to consumer
protection councils, consumer organisations,
District/State/National level Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commissions, retail shops,
marketplaces, etc. Organise the visits to
maximise learners’ experience.  Have a
discussion with them about the purpose of the
visit, things they need to do beforehand and
things that need to be collected and the task
(report/ project / article, etc.) they would carry
out after the visit. As part of this chapter, the
learners may do letter-writing and speaking
activities. We may have to be sensitive to the
language aspect of exercises.
This chapter contains material collected
from authenticated websites, books, newspapers
and magazines. For example, https://consumer
affairs.nic.in is a website of Central Government
Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public
Distribution. Another website www.cuts-
international.org is the website of a consumer
organisation working in India for 40 years. It
publishes a variety of material to create
consumer awareness in India. They need to be
shared among learners so that they can also
collect material as part of their activities. For
example, case histories were taken from
newspaper clippings and consumers who fought
in Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions.
Let learners collect and read such material from
different sources: consumer protection councils,
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions
and internet.

These verdicts came about because
some people persisted and struggled
to get justice. In what ways were they
denied justice? More importantly,
what are the ways in which they can
exercise their rights as consumers to
get a fair deal from the sellers when
they felt they had been denied a just

We participate in the market both as
producers and consumers. As
producers of goods and services we
could be working in any of the sectors
discussed earlier such as agriculture,
industry, or services. Consumers
participate in the market when they
purchase goods and services that they
need. These are the final goods that
people as consumers use.
In the preceding chapters we
discussed the need for rules and
regulations or steps that would
promote development. These could be
for the protection of workers in the
unorganised sector or to protect
people from high interest rates
charged by moneylenders  in the
informal sector. Similarly, rules and
regulations are also required for
protecting the environment.
For example, moneylenders in the
informal sector that you read about
in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to
bind the borrower: they could make
the producer sell the produce to them
at a low rate in return for a timely loan;
they could force a small farmer like
Swapna to sell her land to pay back
the loan. Similarly, many people who
work in the unorganised sector have
to work at a low wage and accept
conditions that are not fair and are
also often harmful to their health. To
prevent such exploitation, we
have talked of rules and regulations
for their protection. There are
organisations that have struggled
for long to ensure that these rules are
followed.
THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE
Likewise, rules and regulations are
required for the protection of the
consumers in the marketplace.
Individual consumers often find
themselves in a weak position.
Whenever there is a complaint
regarding a good or service that had
been bought, the seller tries to shift
all the responsibility on to the buyer.
Their position usually is – “If you
didn’t like what you bought, please
go elsewhere”. As if the seller has no
responsibility once a sale is
completed! The consumer movement,
as we shall discuss later, is an effort
to change this situation.
Exploitation in the marketplace
happens in various ways. For
example, sometimes traders indulge
in unfair trade practices such as when
shopkeepers weigh less than what
they should or when traders add
charges that were not mentioned
before, or when adulterated/defective
goods are sold.
Markets do not work in a fair
manner when producers are few and
powerful whereas consumers
purchase in small amounts and are
scattered. This happens especially
when large companies are producing
these goods. These companies with
huge wealth, power and reach can
manipulate the market in various
ways. At times false information is
passed on through the media, and
other sources to attract consumers.
For example, a company for years
sold powder milk for babies all over
THEY PURPOSELY MADE IT
SO IT WOULD FALL APART
AFTER A FEW MONTHS SO
THAT I WILL BUY A NEW ONE!

struggle before the company was
forced to accept that it had been

long battle had to be fought with
court cases to make cigarette-
manufacturing companies accept that
their product could cause cancer.
Hence, there is a need for rules and
regulations to ensure protection for
consumers.
CONSUMER MOVEMENT
quality of goods and services on the
sellers.
In India, the consumer movement
as a ‘social force’ originated with the
necessity of protecting and promoting
the interests of consumers against
unethical and unfair trade practices.
Rampant food shortages, hoarding,
black marketing, adulteration of food
and edible oil gave birth to the
consumer movement in an organised
form in the 1960s. Till the 1970s,
consumer organisations were largely
engaged in writing articles and
holding exhibitions. They formed
consumer groups to look into the
malpractices in ration shops and
overcrowding in the road passenger
transport. More recently, India
witnessed an upsurge in the number
of consumer groups.
The consumer movement arose out
of dissatisfaction of the consumers
as many unfair practices were being
indulged in by the sellers. There was
no legal system available to
consumers to protect them from
exploitation in the marketplace. For
a long time, when a consumer was
not happy with a particular brand
product or shop, he or she generally
avoided buying that brand product,
or would stop purchasing from that
shop. It was presumed that it was
the responsibility of consumers to be
careful while buying a commodity
or service. It took many years for
organisations in India, and around
the world, to create awareness
amongst people. This has also
shifted the responsibility of ensuring

Consumers International
In 1985 United Nations adopted
the UN Guidelines for Consumer
Protection. This was a tool for
nations to adopt measures to
protect consumers and for
consumer advocacy groups to
press their governments to do
so. At the international level, this
has become the foundation for
consumer movement. Today,
Consumers International has
become an umbrella body to
over 200 member organisations
from over 100 countries.
Because of all these efforts, the movement succeeded in
bringing pressure on business firms as well as government
to correct business conduct which may be unfair and against
the interests of consumers at large. A major step taken in
1986 by the Indian government was the enactment of the
Consumer Protection Act 1986, popularly known as COPRA.
You will learn more about COPRA later.

Reji’s suffering shows how a
hospital, due to negligence by the
doctors and staff in giving
anaesthesia, crippled a student for
life. While using many goods and
services, we as consumers, have the
right to be protected against the
marketing of goods and delivery of
services that are hazardous to life and
property. Producers need to strictly
follow the required safety rules and
regulations. There are many goods
and services that we purchase that
require special attention to safety. For
example, pressure cookers have a
safety valve which, if it is defective, can
cause a serious accident. The
manufacturers of the safety valve have
to ensure high quality. You also need
public or government action to see
that this quality is maintained.
However, we do find bad quality
products in the market because the
supervision of these rules is weak and
the consumer movement is also not
strong enough.

Class IX, was admitted in a private clinic in
Kerala for removal of tonsils. An ENT
surgeon performed the tonsillectomy
operation under general anaesthesia. As a
result of improper anaesthesia Reji showed
symptoms of some brain abnormalities
because of which he was crippled for life.
His father filed a complaint in the State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
claiming compensation of Rs 5,00,000 for
medical negligence and deficiency, in
service. The State Commission, saying that
the evidence was not sufficient, dismissed
it. Reji’s father appealed again in the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission located
in New Delhi. The
National Commission
after looking into the
complaint, held the
hospital responsible
for medical negligence
and directed it to pay
the compensation.

Information about goods and
services
When you buy any commodity, you
will find certain details given on the
packing. These details are about
ingredients used, price, batch
number, date of manufacture, expiry
date and the address of the
manufacturer. When we buy
medicines, on the packets, you might
find ‘directions for proper use’ and
information relating to side effects and
risks associated with usage of that
medicine. When you buy garments,
you will find information on
‘instructions for washing’.
Why is it that rules have been made
so that the manufacturer displays this
information? It is because consumers
have the right to be informed about
the particulars of goods and services
that they purchase. Consumers
can then complain and ask for
compensation or replacement if the
product proves to be defective in any
manner. For example, if we buy a
product and find it defective well
within the expiry period, we can ask
for a replacement. If the expiry period
was not printed, the manufacturer
would blame the shopkeeper and will
not accept the responsibility. If people
sell medicines that have expired
severe action can be taken against
them. Similarly, one can protest and
complain if someone sells a good at
more than the printed price on the
packet. This is indicated by ‘MRP’ —
maximum retail price. In fact
consumers can bargain with the seller
to sell at less than the MRP.
In recent times, the right to
information has been expanded to
cover various services provided by the
Government. In October 2005, the
Government of India enacted a law,
popularly known as RTI (Right to
Information) Act, which ensures its
citizens all the information about the
functions of government departments.
The effect of the RTI Act can be
understood from the following case.

an application using the RTI Act
saying that it was her right to know
the result in a reasonable time so
that she could plan her future. She
was  not only informed about the
reasons for delay in the declaration
of results but also got her call letter
for appointment as she performed
well in the interview.

Abirami, a student of Ansari

course at a local coaching

courses in New Delhi. At the
time of joining the course,
she paid the fees Rs 61,020

course of two years.
However, she decided to opt
out of the course at the end of one year
as she found that the quality of
teaching was not up to the mark. When
she asked for a refund of the fee for one
year, it was denied to her.
When she filed the case in the District

the Institute to refund Rs 28,000 saying
that she had the right to choose. The
Institute again appealed
in the State Consumer
Com-mission. The State
Commission upheld the
District Commission’s
direction and further
fined the institute
Rs 25,000 for a frivolous
appeal. It also directed
the institute to pay
Rs 7000 as compensation and
litigation cost.
The State Commission also restrained
all the educational and professional
institutions in the state from charging
fees from students for the entire
duration of the course in advance and
that too at one go. Any violation of this
order may invite penalties and
imprisonment, the commission said.

Consumers have the right to seek
redressal against unfair trade
practices and exploitation. If any
damage is done to a consumer, she
has the right to get compensation
depending on the degree of damage.
There is a need to provide an easy and
effective public system by which this

The consumer movement in India
has led to the formation of various
organisations, locally known as
consumer forums or consumer
protection councils. They guide
consumers on how to file cases in the
Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commissions. On many occasions,
they also represent individual
consumers in these commissions.
These voluntary organisations also
receive financial support from the
government for creating awareness
among people.

colony, you might have noticed

LEARNING TO BECOME WELL-INFORMED
CONSUMERS
When we as consumers become conscious of our rights,
while purchasing various goods and services, we will
be able to distinguish and make informed choices. This
and national levels was set up for
redressal of consumer disputes. The
district-level authority called District
Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission deals with the cases
involving claims up to Rs 1 crore, the
state-level Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commissions called State
Commission between Rs 1 crore and
Rs 10 crore and the national-level
commission — National Commission
— deals with cases involving claims
exceeding Rs 10 crore. If a case is
dismissed 
in 
district-level
commission, a consumer can also
appeal in the state and then in
national-level commissions.
Thus, the Act has enabled us as
consumers to have the right to
represent in the Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commissions.

The enactment of COPRA has led
to the setting up of separate
Departments of Consumer Affairs in
central and state governments. The
posters that you have seen are one
example through which government

While buying many commodities, on the
cover, you might have seen a logo with the
letters ISI, Agmark, Hallmark or +F. These
logos and certification help consumers get
assured of quality while purchasing the
goods and services. The organisations that
monitor and issue these certificates allow
producers to use their logos provided they
follow certain quality standards.
Though these organisations develop quality
standards for many products, it is not
compulsory for all the producers to follow
standards. However, for some products that
affect the health and safety of consumers or
of products of mass consumption like LPG
cylinders, food colours and additives,
cement, packaged drinking water, it is
mandatory on the part of the producers to
get certified by these organisations.

India has been observing 24
December as the National Consumers’
Day. It was on this day that the Indian
Parliament enacted the Consumer
Protection Act in 1986. India is one
of the countries that have exclusive
authority for consumer redressal.
The consumer movement in India
has made some progress in terms of
numbers of organised groups and
their activities. There are today more
than 2000 consumer groups in the
country of which only about 50-60
are well organised and recognised for
their work.
However, the consumer redressal
process is becoming cumbersome,
expensive and time consuming. Many
a time, consumers are required to
engage lawyers. These cases require

What is the difference between consumer protection council and Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission?

The Consumer Protection Act 1986 ensures the following as rights which every
consumer in India should possess
(i) Right to choice.
(iv)
Right to representation.
(ii) Right to information.
(v)
Right to safety.
(iii) Right to redressal.
(vi)
Right to consumer education.

time for filing and attending the
commission proceedings etc. In most
purchases cash memos are not issued
hence evidence is not easy to gather.
Moreover most purchases in the
market are small retail sales. The
COPRA was amended in the year
2019 
to 
further 
strengthen
consumers in India. Buying through
internet is now included. If there is any
service deficiency or defective product,
service provider or manufacturer is
also held responsible and would be
penalized or even imprisoned.
Settlement of disputes with the help
of a neutral intermediary outside the
Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, called mediator, is now
encouraged at all the three tiers
Consumer Commissions. After more
than 30 years of the enactment of
COPRA, consumer awareness in India
is spreading but slowly. Besides this
the enforcement of laws that protect
workers, 
especially 
in 
the
unorganised sectors is weak.
Similarly, rules and regulations for
working of markets are often not
followed.
Nevertheless, there is scope for
consumers to realise their role and
importance. It is often said that
consumer movements can be effective
only with the consumers’ active
involvement. It requires a voluntary
effort and struggle involving the
participation of one and all.

NOTES FOR TEACHERS
NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
CHAPTER I : DEVELOPMENT
Development has many aspects. The
purpose of this chapter is to enable
students to understand this idea. They
have to understand that people have
different perspectives on development and
there are ways by which we can arrive at
common indicators for development. To
do this, we have used situations that they
can respond to in an intuitive manner; we
have also presented analysis that is more
complex and macro in nature.
How can countries or states be
compared 
using 
some 
selected
development indicators is another
question that students would read
about in this chapter. Economic
development can be measured and
income is the most common method
for measuring development. However,
the income method, though useful,
has several weaknesses. Hence, we
need newer ways of looking at
development using indicators of
quality of life and environmental
sustainability.
It is necessary for you to expect the
students to respond actively in the
classroom and on a topic such as the
above, there would be wide variation in
opinion and possibility of debate. Allow
students to argue their point of view. At
the end of each section there are a few
questions and activities. These serve two
purposes: first, they recap the ideas
discussed in the section and second, they
enable better understanding of the themes
discussed by bringing the learners closer
to their real life situations.
There are certain terms used in this
chapter that would require clarification —
Per Capita Income, Literacy Rate, Infant
Mortality Rate, Attendance Ratio, Life
Expectancy, Gross Enrolment Ratio, and
Human Development Index. Though data
pertaining to these terms are provided,
these would need further explanation. You
may also need to clarify the concept of
Purchasing Power Parity that is used to
calculate Gross National Income per capita
in Table 1.6. It is necessary to keep in mind
that these terms are used as an aid to the
discussion and not something to be
memorised.
Sources for Information
The data for this chapter is taken from
reports published by the Government of
India (Economic Survey, Reports of the
National Family Health Survey and
Handbook of Statistics on the Indian
Economy), United Nations Development
Programme (Human Development Report)
and World Bank (World Development
Indicators). Many of these reports are
published every year. It may be interesting
to look up these reports if they are
available in your school library. If not, you
may log on to the websites of these
institutions (www.budgetindia.nic.in,
www.undp.org,www.worldbank.org,

The idea of development or progress
has always been with us. We have
aspirations or desires about what we
would like to do and how we would
like to live. Similarly, we have ideas
about what a country should be like.
What are the essential things that we
require? Can life be better for all? How
should people live together? Can there
be more equality? Development
involves thinking about these
questions and about the ways in
which we can work towards achieving
these goals. This is a complex
task and in this chapter we shall
make a beginning at understanding
development. You will learn more
about these issues in greater depth
in higher classes. Also, you will find
answers to many of these questions
not just in economics but also in your
course in history and political science.
This is because the way we live today
is influenced by the past. We can’t
desire for change without being aware
of this. In the same way, it is only
through a democratic political
process that these hopes and
possibilities can be achieved in
real life.

Let us try to imagine what
development or progress is likely to
mean to different persons listed in
Table 1.1. What are their aspirations?
You will find that some columns are
partially filled. Try to complete the
table. You can also add any other
category of persons.
Category of Person
Landless rural labourers
Prosperous farmers from Punjab
Farmers who depend only on
rain for growing crops
A rural woman from a land
owning family
Urban unemployed youth
A boy from a rich urban family
A girl from a rich urban family
An adivasi from Narmada valley
WHAT DEVELOPMENT PROMISES —
DIFFERENT PEOPLE, DIFFERENT GOALS
Having filled Table 1.1, let us now
examine it. Do all of these persons
have the same notion of development
or progress? Most likely not.  Each
one of them seeks different things.
They seek things that are most
important for them, i.e., that which
can fulfil their aspirations or desires.
In fact, at times, two persons or
groups of persons may seek things

CATEGORIES OF PERSONS

More days of work and better wages; local school is able to
provide quality education for their children; there is no social
discrimination and they too can become leaders in the village.

which are conflicting.  A girl expects
as much freedom and opportunity as
her brother, and that he also shares
in the household work. Her brother
may not like this.  Similarly, to get
more electricity, industrialists may
want more dams.  But this may
submerge the land and disrupt the
lives of people who are displaced – such
as tribals. They might resent this and
may prefer small check dams or tanks
to irrigate their land.
So, two things are quite clear: one,
different persons can have
different developmental goals and
two, what may be development for
one may not be development for
the other. It may even be
destructive for the other.

INCOME AND OTHER GOALS
If you go over Table 1.1 again, you
will notice one common thing: what
people desire are regular work, better
wages, and decent price for their crops
or other products that they produce.
In other words, they want more
income.
Besides seeking more income, one-
way or the other, people also seek
things like equal treatment, freedom,
security, and respect of others. They
resent discrimination. All these are
important goals. In fact, in some cases,
these may be more important than
more income or more consumption
because material goods are not all
that you need to live.
Money, or material things that one
can buy with it, is one factor on which
our life depends. But the quality of our
life also depends on non-material
things mentioned above.  If it is not
obvious to you, then just think of the
role of your friends in your life. You
may desire their friendship.  Similarly,
there are many things that are not
easily measured but they mean a lot
to our lives. These are often ignored.

1.  Why do different persons have different notions of development? Which of the following
explanations is more important and why?
(a)
Because people are different.
(b)
Because life situations of persons are different.
2. Do the following two statements mean the same? Justify your answer.
(a)
People have different developmental goals.
(b)
People have conflicting developmental goals.
3. Give some examples where factors other than income are important aspects of our lives.
4. Explain some of the important ideas of the above section in your own words.
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
However, it will be wrong to conclude
that what cannot be measured is not
important.
Consider another example. If you
get a job in a far off place, before
accepting it you would try to consider
many factors, apart from income,
such as facilities for your family,
working atmosphere, or opportunity
to learn. In another case, a job may
give you less pay but may offer regular
employment that enhances your
sense of security. Another job,
however, may offer high pay but no
job security and also leave no time for
your family. This will reduce your
sense of security and freedom.
Similarly, for development,
people look at a mix of goals. It is
true that if women are engaged in paid
work, their dignity in the household
and society increases. However, it is
also the case that if there is respect
for women there would be more
sharing of housework and a
greater acceptance of women
working outside. A safe and secure
environment may allow more women
to take up a variety of jobs or run
a business.
Hence, the developmental goals
that people have are not only about
better income but also about other
important things in life.
If, as we have seen above, individuals
seek different goals, then their notion
of national development is also likely
to be different. Discuss among
yourselves on what India should do
for development.
Most likely, you would find that
different students in the class have given
different answers to the above question.
In fact, you might yourself think of
many different answers and not be too
sure of any of these. It is very
important to keep in mind that
different persons could have
different as well as conflicting
notions of a country’s development.
However, can all the ideas be
considered equally important? Or, if
there are conflicts how does one
decide? What would be a fair and just
path for all?  We also have to think
whether there is a better way of doing
things. Would the idea benefit a large
number of people or only a small
group?  National development means
thinking about these questions.

If even the idea of what constitutes
development can be varied and
conflicting, then certainly there can be
differences about ways of developing.  If
you know of any such
controversy, try to find out
arguments advanced by different
people. You may do so by talking to
different persons or you may find it from
newspapers and television.

and who did not?
(ii) What should be the developmental
goal for this country?
3. What can be some of the developmental goals for your village, town or locality?

open-air dumps in a city and
in the surrounding sea. This
happened in a city called
Abidjan in Ivory Coast, a

from the highly toxic waste
caused nausea, skin rashes,
fainting, diarrhoea etc. After a
month seven persons were
dead, twenty in hospital and
twenty six thousand treated
for symptoms of poisoning.

You might ask if development can
mean different things, how come some
countries are generally called
developed and others under-
developed?  Before we come to this,
let us consider another question.
When we compare different things,
they could have similarities as well as
differences. Which aspects do we use
to compare them? Let us look at
students in the class itself.  How do
we compare different students?  They
differ in their height, health, talents
and interests. The healthiest student
may not be the most studious one.
The most intelligent student may not
be the friendliest one.  So, how do we
compare students? The criterion we
may use depends on the purpose of
comparison.  We use different criterion
to choose a sports team, a debate
team, a music team or a team to
organise a picnic.  Still, if for some
purpose, we have to choose the
criterion for the all-round progress of
children in the class, how shall we
do it?
Usually we take one or more
important characteristics of
persons and compare them based
on these characteristics.  Of
course, there can be differences about
what are important characteristics
that should form the basis of
comparison: friendliness and spirit of
cooperation, creativity or marks
secured?
This is true of development too.
For comparing countries, their
income is considered to be one of
the most important attributes.
Countries with higher income are
more developed than others with less
income. This is based on the
understanding that more income
means more of all things that human
beings need.  Whatever people like,
and should have, they will be able to
get with greater income. So, greater
income itself is considered to be one
important goal.
Now, what is the income of a
country? Intuitively, the income of the
country is the income of all the
residents of the country.  This gives
us the total income of the country.
However, for comparison between
countries, total income is not such an
useful measure. Since, countries have
different populations, comparing total
income will not tell us what an average
person is likely to earn. Are people in
one country better off than others in a
different country? Hence, we compare
the average income which is the total
income of the country divided by its
total population. The average income
is also called per capita income.
In World Development Reports,
brought out by the World Bank, this
criterion is used in classifying
countries. Countries with per capita
income of US$ 63,400 per annum
and above in 2023, are called high
income or rich countries and those
with per capita income of about
US$ 2400 or less are called
low-income countries. India comes
in the category of low middle income
countries because its per capita
income in 2023 was just about
US$ 10030 per annum. The rich
countries, excluding countries of
Middle East and certain other small
countries, are generally called
developed countries.

assured of being its fifth citizen
but if it is a lottery that decides
our citizenship number then
perhaps most of us will prefer to
live in country A. Even though
both the countries have identical
average income, country A is
preferred because it has more
equitable distribution.  In this
country people are neither very
rich nor extremely poor. On the
other hand most citizens in
country B are poor and one
person is extremely rich. Hence,
while average income is useful for
comparison it does not tell us how
this income is distributed among
people.
1. Give three examples where an average is used for comparing situations.
2. Why do you think average income is an important criterion for development? Explain.
3. Besides size of per capita income, what other property of income is important in

4. Suppose records show that the average income in a country has been increasing

When 
we 
looked 
at
individual aspirations and
goals, we found that people
not only think of better
income but also have goals
such as security, respect for
others, equal treatment,
freedom, etc. in mind.
Similarly, when we think of a
nation or a region, we may,
besides average income,
think of other equally
important attributes.
INCOME AND OTHER CRITERIA
What could these attributes be? Let
us examine this through an example.
Table 1.3 gives the per capita income
of Haryana, Kerala  and Bihar.
Actually, these figures are of Per
Capita Net State Domestic Product at
Current Prices for 2021–22. Let us
ignore what this complicated term
exactly means. Roughly, we can take
it to be the per capita income of the
state. We find that of the three,
Haryana has the highest per capita

income and Bihar is at the bottom.
This means that, on an average,
a person in Haryana earned
Rs 2,64,729 in one year whereas, on
an average, a person in Bihar earned
only around Rs 47,500. So, if per
capita income were to be used as the
measure of development, Haryana will
be considered the most developed
and Bihar the least developed state of
the three. Now, let us look at certain
other data pertaining to these states
given in Table 1.4.

Explanation of some of the terms used in this table:
Infant Mortality Rate (or IMR) indicates the number of children that die before the age of  one
year  as a proportion of 1000 live children born in that particular year.
Literacy Rate measures the proportion of literate population in the 7-and-above age group.
Net Attendance Ratio is the total number of children of age group of 15-17 years attending
school as a percentage of total number of children in the same age group.

What does this table show?  The
first column of the table shows that
in Kerala, out of 1000 children born,
6 died before completing one year of
age but in Haryana the proportion of
children dying within one year of birth
was 28, which is nearly three times
more than that of Kerala. On the other
hand, the per capita income of
Haryana is more than that of Kerala
as shown in Table 1.3. Just think of
how dear you are to your parents,
think of how every one is so happy
when a child is born.  Now, try to think
of parents whose children die before
they even celebrate their first birthday.
How painful it must be to these
parents?  Next, note the year to which
this data pertains. This was during
2018.  So we are not talking of old
times; it is 70 years after independence
when our metro cities are full of high
rise buildings and shopping malls!
How is it that the average person in
Haryana has more income than the
average person in Kerala but lags
behind in these crucial areas? The
reason is — money in your pocket
cannot buy all the goods and services
that you may need to live well.  So,
income by itself is not a completely
adequate indicator of material goods and
services that citizens are able to use.
For example, normally, your money
cannot buy you a pollution-free
environment or ensure that you get
unadulterated medicines, unless you
can afford to shift to a community that
already has all these things.  Money may
also not be able to protect you from
infectious diseases, unless the whole of
your community takes preventive steps.
The problem does not end with
Infant Mortality Rate. The last
column of table 1.4 shows that
about one-third of the children aged
15–17 years in Bihar are not
attending school in secondary
classes. This means that if you went
to school in Bihar nearly one-third
of your class friends would be
missing. Those who could have been
in school are not there! If this had
happened to you, you would not be
able to read what you are reading now.
Actually for many of the important
things in life the best way, also the
cheapest way, is to provide these
goods and services collectively. Just
think – will it be cheaper to have
collective security for the whole
locality or for each house to have its
own security staff?  What if no one,
other than you, in your village or locality
is interested in studying? Would you be
able to study? Not unless your parents
could afford to send you to some private
school elsewhere.  So you are actually
able to study because many other
children also want to study and because
many people believe that the government
should open schools and provide other
facilities so that all children have a chance
to study. Even now, in many areas,
children, particularly girls, are not able
to go to high school because the
government/society has not provided
adequate facilities.

ACTIVITY 2
(a)
The literacy rate for all age groups, including young and old, is _____ for rural
males and _____ for rural females. However, it is not just that these many
adults could not attend school but that there are _____ who are currently not in
school.
 (b) It is clear from the table that _____ % of rural girls and _____% of rural boys are
not attending school. Therefore, illiteracy among children in the age group 10-
14 is as high as _____% for rural females and _____% for rural males.
 (c) This high level of illiteracy among __________ age group, even after more than
75 years of our independence, is most disturbing. In many other states also we
are nowhere near realisation of the constitutional goal of free and compulsory
education for all children up to the age of 14, which was expected to be achieved
by 1960.
Study Table 1.5 carefully and fill in the blanks in the following paragraphs.  For this,
you may need to make calculations based on the table.
1. Look at data in Tables 1.3 and 1.4. Is Haryana ahead of Kerala
in literacy rate etc., as it is in terms of per capita income?
2. Think of other examples where collective provision of goods
and services is cheaper than individual provision.
3. Does availability of good health and educational facilities depend
only on amount of money spent by the government on these
facilities? What other factors could be relevant?
4. In a study, it was found that in Tamil Nadu, 90 per cent of the
people living in rural areas used a ration shop, whereas in West
Bengal only 35 per cent of rural people did so. Where would
people did better off and why?
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
TABLE 1.5 EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT OF RURAL
POPULATION OF UTTAR PRADESH
Kerala has a low Infant Mortality
Rate because it has adequate
provision of basic health and
educational facilities.  Similarly, in
some states, the Public Distribution
System (PDS) functions well.  Health
and nutritional status of people of
such states is certainly likely to be
better.

Once it is realised that even though
the level of income is important, yet it
is an inadequate measure of the level
of development, we begin to think of
other criterion. There could be a long
list of such criterion but then it would
not be so useful. What we need is a
small number of the most important
things. Health and education
indicators, such as the ones we used
in comparison of Kerala and Haryana,
are among them. Over the past decade
or so, health and education indicators
have come to be widely used along
with income as a measure of
development. For instance, Human
Development Report published by
UNDP compares countries based on
the educational levels of the people,
their health status and per capita
income. It would be interesting to look
at certain relevant data regarding
India and its neighbours from Human
Development Report 2023-24.

NOTES
1. HDI stands for Human Development Index. HDI ranks in above table are out of 193 countries in all.
2. Life Expectancy at birth denotes, as the name suggests, average expected length of life of a person
at the time of birth.
3. Per Capita Income is calculated in dollars for all countries so that it can be compared. It is also
done in a way so that every dollar would buy the same amount of goods and services in any
country.
ACTIVITY 3
One way to find out if we are properly nourished is to
calculate what nutrition scientists call Body Mass Index
(BMI). This is easy to calculate. Let each student in
the class find out his or her weight and height. Take the
weight of each student in kilograms (kg). Then, take
the height by drawing up a scale on the wall and
measuring accurately with the head straight. Convert
the height recorded in centimeters into meters. Divide
the weight in kg by the square of the height. The number
you get is called BMI. Then, look at the BMI-for-Age
tables given on pages
90–91. A student’s BMI
could be within the normal
range or less than that
(underweight) or more
(obesity). For example, if
a girl student is 14 years
and 8 month old and the
BMI is 15.2, then she is
undernourished. Similarly,
if the BMI of a boy aged
15 years and 6 months is
28, then he is overweight.
Discuss the life situation,
food and exercise habits
of students, in general,
without body shaming
anyone.

Isn’t it surprising that a small
country in our neighbourhood, Sri
Lanka, is much ahead of India in every
respect and a big country like ours has
such a low rank in the world? Table
1.6 also shows that though Nepal and
Bangladesh have low per capita
income than that of India, yet they are
better than India in life expectancy.
Many improvements have been
suggested in calculating HDI and
Suppose for the present that a
particular country is quite developed.
We would certainly like this level of
development to go up further or at
least be maintained for future
generations. This is obviously
desirable.  However, since the second
half of the twentieth century, a number
of scientists have been warning that
the present type, and levels, of
development are not sustainable.

Example 1: Groundwater in India
“Recent evidence suggests that the groundwater is under serious
threat of overuse in many parts of the country. About 300 districts
have reported a water level decline of over 4 metres during the
past 20 years. Nearly one-third of the country is overusing their
groundwater 
reserves. 
In 
another 
25 
years,
60 per cent of the country would be doing the same if the present
way of using this resource continues. Groundwater overuse is
particularly found in the agriculturally prosperous regions of
Punjab and Western U.P., hard rock plateau areas of central and
south India, some coastal areas and the rapidly growing urban
settlements.”
(a) Why groundwater is overused?
(b) Can there be development without overuse?
SUSTAINABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT
many new components have been
added to the Human Development
Report but, by pre-fixing Human to
Development, it has made it very clear
that what is important in development
is what is happening to citizens of a
country.  It is people, their health, their
well being, that is most important.
Do you think there are certain
other aspects that should be
considered in measuring human
development?
LET’S UNDERSTAND WHY
THIS IS SO THROUGH THE
FOLLOWING EXAMPLE:
“We have not inherited
the world from our
forefathers — we have
borrowed it from our
children.”

Groundwater is an example of
renewable resources. These resources
are replenished by nature as in the
case of crops and plants. However,
even these resources may be
overused. For example, in the case of
groundwater, if we use more than
what is being replenished by rain then
we would be overusing this resource.
FOR EXAMPLE, CRUDE OIL THAT WE
EXTRACT FROM THE EARTH IS A NON-
RENEWABLE RESOURCE. HOWEVER WE
MAY FIND A SOURCE OF OIL THAT WE DID
NOT KNOW OF EARLIER. EXPLORATIONS
ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN ALL THE TIME.

The table gives an estimate of reserves of crude oil (column1). More
important, it also tells us for how many years the stock of crude oil will
last if people continue to extract it at the present rate. The reserves
would last only 50 years more. This is for the world as a whole. However,
different countries face different situations. Countries like India depend
on importing oil  from abroad because they do not have enough stocks
of their own. If prices of oil increase this becomes a burden for everyone.
There are countries like USA which have low reserves and hence want to
secure oil through military or economic power.
The question of sustainability of development raises many fundamentally
new issues about the nature and process of development.
(a) Is crude oil essential for the development process in a country?
Discuss.
(b) India has to import crude oil. What problems do you anticipate
for the country looking at the above situation?
Non-renewable resources are those
which will get exhausted after a few
years of use. We have a fixed stock on
earth which cannot be replenished. We
do discover new resources that we did
not know of earlier. New sources in
this way add to the stock. However,
over time, even this will get exhausted.

9. Why is the issue of sustainability important for development?
Consequences of environmental
degradation do not respect national

no longer region or nation specific.
Our future is linked together.
Sustainability of development is
comparatively a new area of
knowledge in which scientists,
economists, philosophers and other
social scientists are working
together.
In general, the question of
development or progress is perennial.
At all times as a member of society
and as individuals we need to ask
where we want to go, what we wish to
become and what our goals are. So
the debate on development continues.

FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning,
which continues to shape our system, and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of
sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-
centered system of education outlined in the National Policy on
Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by
adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites
of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training
(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development
committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson
of the advisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the
secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for
this book, Professor Tapas Majumdar for guiding the work of this
committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this

We are indebted to the institutions and organisations, which have
generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National
Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary
and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development
under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an

improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments

A FEW INTRODUCTORY WORDS FOR TEACHERS
This book introduces you to a simplified view of the process of development in
the Indian economy. In Economics, we usually try to look at development as a
process of change in the economic life of the people, as producers or consumers
of goods and services. Sometimes, development is studied mainly as a
phenomenon that acquired significance only with the growth of the modern
industrial civilisation. This is because the state of development (or
underdevelopment) of a country has often depended on outcomes of wars and
conquests and on colonial exploitation of one country by another. However, in
this book, we have not emphasised on the external factors. We have taken a
long view of the process of development: a process that could have started
before any external factors intervened or interrupted it. The process of
development may also restart after such interruptions, and continue on
independent lines after the period of subjugation ends. This has happened in
the case of our own country, India.
In this book the first beginnings of development are seen in terms of the
emergence of agriculture, manufacturing and services as three distinct sectors
of the economy. We have also tried to look at economic development not in
isolation but as part of a more general concept of human development that
includes the development of health and education and other indicators that,
along with income, broadly define the quality of life of a people.
In the first chapter, we will study how people actually perceive development
and how it can be measured. There are various measures available for this
purpose. We will look at the extent to which some of the important developmental
indicators help in understanding development and how the process may affect
different people differently.
Development as a process had probably started quite early in history. To
begin with, perhaps no country could be distinguished as developed in the
sense that we understand development. Perhaps the process would have started
in most human settlements when people started living in relative peace and in
more or less fixed habitations without which agriculture would not have been
possible on any significant scale. Once agriculture began and developed, the
extraction of other natural products, like mineral ores, probably was started.
This latter process of recovering stones and other minerals is called ‘quarrying’.
Humans learnt to use the non-food products like wood from trees and the
minerals obtained from quarrying as raw materials for making their tools,
weapons, utensils, fishing nets and so on. These were the first human-made
products called ‘artefacts’. Economists called the process of making the artefacts
‘manufacture’ as distinguished from ‘agriculture (including quarrying)’ that
covered the gathering, cultivating or extracting of purely natural products such
as fruit, rice or minerals.
The separation of productive activities between the two distinct sectors of
agriculture including quarrying (also called the Primary Sector) and
Reprint 2025-26
Reprint 2025-26
(vi)
manufacture (also called the Secondary Sector) was probably the first visible
manifestation of economic development. This separation came about through
the process of “division of labour” as Adam Smith, regarded as the father of
economics had called it. The process is briefly explained below.
At first every person, or at least members of every household, presumably,
had to do everything all by themselves. Then at some point the advantage of
‘division of labour’ must have been felt. Humans found out with experience
that production became more efficient if some people concentrated on learning
how to fish, others on how to till the soil, still others on how to produce
pottery, or trap or hunt animals and birds for food and so on. This was also
‘development’ of a kind. Then there emerged specialists who were not
themselves producing any good at all: they were people specialising in
teaching others how to do these things better. There were also doctors who
healed people when they were injured or had fallen ill. Naturally division of
labour between people increased the productivity of all the people and the
economy grew.
The second chapter will look at the way economic activities in a modern
economy can be classified and understood within the framework of primary,
secondary and tertiary sectors. The discussion here is focussed on India and
the changes that have occurred in the three sectors over the past decades. Besides
this, it also provides two other ways of classifying economic activities — organised
and unorganised, and private and public sectors. The relevance of additional
ways of classification for understanding the problems and challenges of the
modern Indian economy is illustrated using real life examples and case studies.
The third chapter initiates the learners into the world of money — its role in
a modern economy, forms and its linkage with various institutions such as
banks. Then the chapter moves on to discuss the role of banks and other
institutions in providing credit to the people. Issues stressed in the discussion
on credit are (a) pervasiveness of credit in economic life across a very large
section of the population (b) the preponderance of informal credit in India and
(c) role of credit in creating either a self-sustaining virtuous cycle of productive
investment, higher income streams, higher standards of living leading to more
productive investments contributing to development, or a vicious cycle of
indebtedness, poverty and debt-trap leading to increased poverty. These ideas
are presented through case studies.
Globalisation is an important phenomenon, which has influenced
development and people around the world in various ways. The fourth chapter
focuses on a particular dimension of globalisation that is economic in nature
— the complex organisation of production. How multinational companies

important factors and institutions that facilitate globalisation also find place
in this chapter. In the end, the chapter appraises the impacts of globalisation
(positive and negative) on the Indian economy.
The process of development leads to not only higher levels of production in
different sectors of the economy, but has some down sides too. The examples
and case studies in this chapter and elsewhere try to examine whether the
benefits of development are spreading to all people (producers big and small,
workers in the organised or unorganised sectors, consumers belonging to all

income groups, men and women and so on) or are being confined to only some
privileged sections.
Our final chapter presents a relevant study of how, and to what extent, we
can protect the rights of citizens as consumers. During the process of rapid
development and emergence of new brands and advertisement campaigns by
unscrupulous producers, consumers are often at the receiving end of business
malpractices. After tracing the historical root of the consumer movement and
through various real-life instances, this chapter tells of different inexpensive
consumer protection mechanisms evolved over the years. It also offers details
of how people can now assert some of their rights at very little expense at the
special consumer courts that operate outside the existing cumbersome,
expensive and time-consuming legal procedures.
Features of this Textbook
The purpose of the book is to understand the economic life around us and
also to think about what we would mean by economic development for people.
There are many examples and case studies that we have used both as an
aid for conceptual clarity and to relate these ideas to real life. These have  to
be read and used, keeping this overall objective in view.

Let’s work this out, given after
each section in the chapters. This contains a few questions to review the section
and open-ended questions and activities that can be taken up within and
outside the classroom. Some of the internal exercises should be done in the
discussion mode. Students can discuss these in groups and present their
conclusions and the answers may be put up for debate with the entire class.
This will require more time but it is essential as this allows students to
explore and learn from each other. The intention is to allow for more
interaction than is usually observed but there is no fixed formula for doing
this. Each teacher would find his or her own ways and we would like to
express our faith in their abilities to do so.
Wherever possible, we have attempted to provide the latest statistics. Not all
authentic data is available for the recent years. Also, economic trends do not
change in a few years. Rather worrying about the latest data, you may bring to
the notice the central idea of what the concept and data related to it convey to
us. Questions on the data aspects may be avoided.
We have used many reference material while preparing this book. Besides
these, many news clippings, reports from government and
non-government organisations were also used. Some of them are mentioned

Evaluation
While addressing the need for reforms in education, the National Curriculum
Framework 2005 and the Position Paper of the National Focus Group on
Examination Reforms call for a change in the way questions are asked in
examinations. The questions asked in this book make a departure from an
evaluation pattern that encourages rote-memorisation to one that inculcates
creative thinking, imagination, reflection and hones the analytical ability of
learners. Based on the examples shown here, teachers can formulate additional
questions.
Questions that test the understanding of core concepts
(a) GDP is the total value of _________ produced during a particular year.
(i) all goods and services
(ii) all final goods and services
(iii) all intermediate goods and services
(iv) all intermediate and final goods and services
(b) Analyse the role of credit for development.
(c) In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to interlinking
of production?
(d) How would flexibility in labour laws help companies?
Questions to assess analytical abilities, interpretation and coherent
presentation
(a) The following table gives the GDP in Rupees (crores) by the three secors:

Questions to test reflective thinking
(a) Look at the picture (high rise buildings with slums around). What should be the
developmental goals for such an area?
(b) “The Earth has enough resources to meet the needs of all but not enough to satisfy
the greed of even one person”. How is this statement relevant to the discussion of
development? Discuss.
(c) “Tertiary sector is not playing any significant role in the development of Indian
economy”. Do you agree? Give reasons in support of your answer.
(d) People make complaints about the lack of civic amenities such as bad roads or
poor water and health facilities but no one listens. Now the RTI Act gives you the
power to question. Do you agree? Discuss.
Questions that test the ability to apply concepts and ideas to real life
problems / situations
(a) What can be some of the developmental goals for your village, town or locality?
(b) Students in a school are often classified into primary and secondary or junior and
senior. What is the criterion used here? Do you think this is useful classification?
(c) In what ways can employment be increased in urban areas?
(d) What do you understand by disguised unemployment? Explain with an example
each from the urban and rural areas.
(e) Describe some of your duties as consumers if you visit a shopping complex in
your locality.
It is also necessary to develop questions that require students to draw from
one or more areas of the syllabus for making relevant connections between
materials from different chapters. For instance, in Chapter 4 one question links
to Chapter 1— In chapter 1, we saw what may be development for one may
be destructive for others. The setting of SEZs has been opposed by some
people in India. Find out who are these people and why are they opposing it.
We hope that you along with your students would look at this textbook
itself in a critical manner and send us your critique, questions, clarification,
etc. to the following address. AND we could continue this discussion further.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
CHAPTER 2:   SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY
An economy is best understood when we
study its components or sectors. Sectoral
classification can be done on the basis of
several criteria. In this chapter, three
types of classifications are discussed:
primary/secondary/tertiary; organised/
unorganised; and public/private. You can
create a discussion about these types by
taking examples familiar to the students
and relate them to their daily life. It is
important to emphasise the changing
roles of sectors. This can be highlighted
further by drawing attention of the
students to the rapid growth of service
sector. While elaborating the ideas
provided in the chapter, the students may
need to be familiarised with a few
fundamental concepts such as Gross
Domestic Product, Employment etc. Since
the students may find this difficult to
understand, it is necessary to explain to
them through examples. Several activities
and exercises are suggested in the chapter
to help the students understand how a
person’s activity could be placed —
whether in the primary, secondary or
tertiary, organised or unorganised, and
public or private sector. You may
encourage the students to talk to various
working people around them (such as
shop owners, casual workers, vegetable
vendors, workshop mechanics, domestic
workers etc.) to know more about how they
live and work. Based on such information,
the students can be encouraged to
develop their own classification of
economic activities.
Another important issue to be
highlighted is about the problems caused
by the changes in the roles of sectors.
The chapter has taken the example of
unemployment and what the government
can do to solve it. The declining importance
of agriculture and growing importance of
industry and services should be related
to the experience of the children by taking
more examples that they may observe in
their day-to-day life. Information derived
from the media could be used for this
purpose. You may encourage the students
to bring important cuttings and stories
from newspapers, which could be
prominently displayed in storyboards, and
encourage the class to discuss these
issues. While discussing the unorganised
sector, the key issue of protecting the
workers engaged in the sector should be
highlighted. You may  also encourage the
students to visit persons and enterprises
in the unorganised sector and get a first
hand experience from real life situation.
Sources for Information
The GVA data used in this chapter
pertaining to Real Gross Value Added at
Basic Prices by Industry of Origin at
2011–12 prices is taken from Economic
Survey. It is a valuable source of GVA and
other information relating to the Indian
economy. For evaluation purposes,
particularly to develop the analytical
ability of learners, teachers can refer to
this report through the Internet to get data
for different years.  Due to change in
methodology, latest data is not used in the
chapter.
The employment figures are based
on data taken from the five-yearly surveys
on employment and unemployment
conducted by the National Sample Survey
Organisation (NSSO) now known as
National Statistical Office (NSO). NSO is
an organisation under the Ministry of
Statistics and Programme Implementation,
Government of India. The website you can
log onto is: http:/mospi.gov.in. Employment
data is also available from other sources
such as Census of India.

CHAPTER 2
SECTORS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
Let us look at these pictures. You will find that people are
engaged in various economic activities. Some of these are
activities producing goods. Some others are producing
services. These activities are happening around us every
minute even as we speak.  How do we understand these
activities? One way of doing this is to group them (classify
them) using some important criterion. These groups are also
called sectors.

There are many activities that are
undertaken by directly using
natural resources. Take, for
example, the cultivation of cotton. It
takes place within a crop season. For
the growth of the cotton plant, we
depend mainly, but not entirely,
on natural factors like rainfall,
sunshine and climate. The product
of this activity, cotton, is a natural
product. Similarly, in the case of an
activity like dairy, we are dependent
on the biological process of
the animals and availability
of fodder etc. The product
here, milk, also is a natural
product. Similarly, minerals
and ores are also natural
products. When we produce
a good by exploiting natural
resources, it is an activity of
the primary sector. Why
primary? This is because it
forms the base for all
other products that we
subsequently make. Since
most 
of 
the 
natural
products we get are from
agriculture, dairy, fishing,
forestry, this sector is also
called agriculture and related
sector.
The secondary sector covers
activities in which natural products
are changed into other forms through
ways of manufacturing that we
associate with industrial activity. It is
the next step after primary. The
product is not produced by nature
but has to be made and therefore
some process of manufacturing is
essential. This could be in a factory, a
workshop or at home.  For example,
using cotton fibre from the plant, we
spin yarn and weave cloth. Using
sugarcane as a raw material, we make
sugar or gur. We convert earth into
bricks and use bricks to make houses
and buildings. Since this sector
gradually became associated with the
different kinds of industries that came
up, it is also called as industrial sector.
After primary and secondary, there
is a third category of activities that falls
under tertiary sector and is different
from the above two. These are
activities that help in the development
of the primary and secondary sectors.
These activities, by themselves, do not
produce a good but they are an aid
or a support for the production
process. For example, goods that are
produced in the primary or secondary
sector would need to be transported
by trucks or trains and then sold in
wholesale and retail shops. At times,
it may be necessary to store these in
godowns. We also may need to talk to
others over telephone or send letters
(communication) or borrow money
from banks (banking) to help
production and trade. Transport,
storage, communication, banking,
trade are some examples of tertiary
activities. Since these activities
generate services rather than goods,
the tertiary sector is also called the
service sector.
Service sector also includes some
essential services that may not directly
help in the production of goods. For
example, we require teachers, doctors,
and those who provide personal
services such as washermen, barbers,
cobblers, lawyers, and people to do
administrative and accounting works.
In recent times, certain new services
based on information technology such
as internet cafe, ATM booths, call
centres, software companies etc have
become important.

EXAMPLE
Imagine what would happen if farmers
refuse to sell sugarcane to a particular
sugar mill. The mill will have to shut
down.
Imagine what would happen to cotton
cultivation if companies decide not to
buy from the Indian market and import
all cotton they need from other
countries. Indian cotton cultivation will
become less profitable and the farmers
may even go bankrupt, if they cannot
quickly switch to other crops. Cotton
prices will fall.
Farmers buy many goods such as
tractors, 
pumpsets, 
electricity,
pesticides and fertilisers. Imagine what
would happen if the price of fertilisers
or pumpsets go up. Cost of cultivation
of the farmers will rise and their profits
will be reduced.
People working in industrial and service
sectors need food. Imagine what would
happen if there is a strike by
transporters and lorries refuse to take
vegetables, milk, etc. from rural areas.
Food will become scarce in urban areas
whereas farmers will be unable to sell
their products.

The various production activities in the primary, secondary and
tertiary sectors produce a very large number of goods and
services. Also, the three sectors have a large number of people
working in them to produce these goods and services.  The next
step, therefore, is to see how much goods and services are
produced and how many people work in each sector. In an
economy there could be one or more sectors which are dominant
in terms of total production and employment, while other sectors
are relatively small in size.
How do we count the various goods and services
and know the total production in each sector?
With so many thousands of goods and services produced, you
might think this is an impossible task! Not only would the task
be enormous, you might also wonder how we can add up cars
and computers and nails and furniture. It won’t make sense!!!
You are right in thinking so. To get around this problem,
economists suggest that the values of goods and services should
be used rather than adding up the actual numbers. For example,
if 10,000 kgs of wheat is sold at Rs 20 per kg, the value of
wheat will be Rs 2,00,000. The value of 5000 coconuts at Rs
15 per coconut will be Rs 75,000. Similarly, the value of goods
and services in the three sectors are calculated, and then added
up.
Remember, there is one precaution one has to take. Not every
good (or service) that is produced and sold needs to be counted. It
makes sense only to include the final goods and services. Take,
for instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a flour mill for Rs 20 per
kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells the flour to a biscuit
company for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour
and things such as sugar and oil to make four packets of biscuits.
It sells biscuits in the market to the consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20
per packet). Biscuits are the final goods, i.e., goods that reach the
consumers.
Why are only ‘final goods and services’ counted? In contrast
to final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat flour in this
example are intermediate goods.  Intermediate goods are used
up in producing final goods and services. The value of final
goods already includes the value of all the intermediate goods
that are used in making the final good. Hence, the value of Rs
80 for the biscuits (final good) already includes the value of
flour (Rs 25). Similarly, the value of all other intermediate goods
would have been included. To count the value of the flour and
wheat separately is therefore not correct because then we would
be counting the value of the same things a number of times.
First as wheat, then as flour and finally as biscuits.

economy is.
In India, the mammoth task of
measuring GDP is undertaken by a central
government ministry. This Ministry, with
the help of various government
departments of all the Indian states and
union territories, collects information
relating to total volume of goods and
services and their prices and then estimates
the GDP.
Recently Indian Government began to
bring out the contribution of three sectors
towards Gross Value Added (GVA) in place
of the contribution of three sectors towards
Gross Domestic Product to be at par with
global practices. The GVA measures the
contribution of three sectors of an
economy after adjusting for taxes and
subsidies. You will learn more about the
GVA and the difference between GDP
and GVA in higher classes. Here we will
only understand how goods and services
produced in these three sectors—primary,
secondary 
and 
tertiary 
sectors
have changed.
Historical Change in Sectors
Generally, it has been noted from the
histories of many, now developed,
countries that at initial stages of
development, primary sector was the most
important sector of economic activity.
As the methods of farming changed
and agriculture sector began to prosper,
it produced much more food than before.
Many people could now take up other
activities. There were increasing number
of craft-persons and traders. Buying and
selling activities increased many times.
Besides, there were also transporters,
administrators, army etc. However, at this
stage, most of the goods produced were
natural products from the primary sector
and most people were also employed in
this sector.
Over a long time (more than hundred
years), and especially because new methods
of manufacturing were introduced,
factories came up and started expanding.
Those people who had earlier worked on
farms now began to work in factories in
large numbers. They were forced to do so
as you read in history chapters. People
began to use many more goods that were
produced in factories at cheap rates.
Secondary sector gradually became the
most important in total production and
employment. Hence, over time, a shift had
taken place. This means that the importance
of the sectors had changed.
In the past 100 years, there has been a
further shift from secondary to tertiary
sector in developed countries.  The service
sector has become the most important in
terms of total production. Most of the
working people are also employed in the
service sector. This is the general pattern
observed in developed countries.
What is the total production and
employment in the three sectors in India?
Over the years have there been changes
similar to the pattern observed for the
developed countries? We shall see in the
next section.
1. What does the history of developed countries indicate
about the shifts that have taken place between sectors?
2. Correct and arrange the important aspects for calculating
GDP from this Jumble.
To count goods and services we add the numbers that
are produced. We count all those that were produced in
the last five years. Since we shouldn’t leave out anything
we add up all these goods and services.
3. Discuss with your teacher how you could calculate the
total value of a good or service by using the method of
value added at each stage.

Rising Importance of the
Tertiary Sector in Production
Over the forty years between 1977–78
and 2017–18, while production in all
the three sectors has increased, it has
increased the most in the tertiary sector.
As a result, in the year 2017–18, the
tertiary sector has emerged as the
largest producing sector in India
replacing the primary sector.
Why is the tertiary sector becoming
so important in India? There could be
several reasons.
First, in any country several
services such as hospitals,
educational institutions, post and
telegraph services, police stations,
courts, village administrative offices,
municipal corporations, defence,
transport, 
banks, 
insurance
companies, etc. are required. These
can be considered as basic services.
In a developing country the
government has to take responsibility
for the provision of these services.
Second, the development of
agriculture and industry leads to the
development of services such as

transport, trade, storage and the
like, as we have already seen. Greater
the development of the primary and
secondary sectors, more would be the
demand for such services.
Third, as income levels rise, certain
sections of people start demanding
many more services like eating out,
tourism, shopping, private hospitals,
private schools, professional training
etc. You can see this change quite
sharply in cities, especially in big cities.
Fourth, over the past decade or so,
certain new services such as
those based on information and
communication technology have
become important and essential. The
production of these services has been
rising rapidly.  In Chapter 4, we shall
see examples of these new services
and the reasons for their expansion.
However, you must remember that
not all of the service sector is growing
equally well. Service sector in India
employs many different kinds of
people. At one end there are a limited
number of services that employ highly
skilled and educated workers. At the
other end, there are a very large
number of workers engaged in
services such as small shopkeepers,
repair persons, transport persons,
etc. These people barely manage to
earn a living and yet they perform
these services because no alternative
opportunities for work are available
to them. Hence, only a part of this
sector is growing in importance. You
shall read more about this in the next
section.
Where are most of the people
employed?
Graph 2 presents percentage share of
the three sectors in GVA. Now you can
directly see the changing importance
of the sectors over the forty years.
Graph 2: Share of Sectors in GVA
A remarkable fact about India is
that while there has been a change
in the share of the three sectors in
GVA, a similar shift has not taken
place in employment. Graph 3
shows the share of employment in
the three sectors in 1977-78 and
2017-18. The primary sector
continues to be the largest
employer even now.
Why didn’t a similar shift out
of primary sector happen in case
of employment? It is because not
enough jobs were created in the
secondary and tertiary sectors.  Even

though industrial output or the
production of goods went up by
more than nine times during the
period, employment in the industry
went up by around three times. The
same applies to the tertiary sector
as well. While production in the
service sector rose by 14 times,
employment in the service sector
rose around five times.
As a result, more than half of the
workers in the country are working
in the primary sector, mainly in
agriculture, producing only about
one sixth of the GVA. In contrast to
this, the secondary and tertiary
sectors produce the rest of the
produce whereas they employ less
about half the people. Does this mean
that the workers in agriculture
are not producing as much as
they could?
What it means is that there
are more people in agriculture than
is necessary. So, even if you move
a few people out, production will
not be affected. In other words,
workers in the agricultural sector are
underemployed.
For instance, take the case of a
small farmer, Laxmi, owning about
two hectares of unirrigated land
dependent only on rain and
growing crops, like jowar and arhar.
All five members of her family work
in the plot throughout the year.
Why? They have nowhere else to go
for work. You will see that everyone
is working, none remains idle, but
in actual fact, their labour effort
gets divided. Each one is doing
some work but no one is fully
employed. This is the situation of
underemployment, where people
are apparently working but all
of them are made to work less
than their potential. This kind of
underemployment is hidden in
contrast to someone who does not
have a job and is clearly visible as
unemployed. Hence, it is also
called disguised unemployment.
Now, supposing a landlord,
Sukhram, comes and hires one or
two members of the family to work
on his land. Laxmi’s family is now
able to earn some extra income
through wages. Since you do not
need five people to look after that
small plot, two people moving out
does not affect production on their
farm. In the above example, two
people may move to work in a
factory. Once again the earnings of
the family would increase and they
would also continue to produce as
much from their land.
There are lakhs of farmers like
Laxmi  in India. This means that even
if we remove a lot of people from
agricultural sector and provide them
with proper work elsewhere,
agricultural production will not
suffer. The incomes of the people who
take up other work would increase
the total family income.
This underemployment can also
happen in other sectors. For
example there are thousands of
casual workers in the service
sector in urban areas who search
for daily employment. They are
employed as painters, plumbers,
repair persons and others doing
odd jobs. Many of them don’t find
work everyday. Similarly, we see
other people of the service sector
on the street pushing a cart or
selling something where they may
spend the whole day but earn
very little. They are doing this
work because they do not have
better opportunities.

How to Create More
Employment?
From the above discussion, we can see
that there continues to be considerable
underemployment in agriculture.
There are also people who are not
employed at all. In what ways can one
increase employment for people? Let
us look at some of them.
Take the case of Laxmi with her
two-hectare plot of unirrigated land.
The government can spend some
money or banks can provide a loan,
to construct a well for her family to
irrigate the land. Laxmi will then be
able to irrigate her land and take a
second crop, wheat, during the rabi
season. Let us suppose that one
hectare of wheat can provide
employment to two people for 50 days
(including sowing, watering, fertiliser

application and harvesting).  So, two
more members of the family can be
employed in her own field. Now
suppose a new dam is constructed
and canals are dug to irrigate many
such farms. This could lead to a lot of
employment generation within the
agricultural sector itself reducing the
problem of underemployment.
Now, suppose Laxmi and other
farmers produce much more than
before. They would also need to sell some
of this. For this they may be required to
transport their products to a nearby
town. If the government invests some
money in transportation and storage of
crops, or makes better rural roads so
that mini-trucks reach everywhere
several farmers like Laxmi, who now
have access to water, can continue to
grow and sell these crops. This activity
can provide productive employment to
not just farmers but also others such as
those in services like transport or trade.
Laxmi’s need is not confined to
water alone. To cultivate the land, she
also needs seeds, fertilisers,
agricultural equipment and pumpsets
to draw water. Being a poor farmer,
she cannot afford many of these. So,
she will have to borrow money from
moneylenders and pay a high rate of
interest. If the local bank gives her
credit at a reasonable rate of interest,
she will be able to buy all these in time
and cultivate her land. This means that
along with water, we also need to
provide cheap agricultural credit to the
farmers for farming to improve. We will
look at some of these needs in Chapter
3, Money and Credit.
Another way by which we can
tackle this problem is to identify,
promote and locate industries and
services in semi-rural areas where a
large number of people may be
employed. For instance, suppose
many farmers decide to grow arhar
and chickpea (pulse crops). Setting
up a dal mill to procure and process
these and sell in the cities is one such
example. Opening a cold storage could
give an opportunity for farmers to
store their products like potatoes and
onions and sell them when the price
is good. In villages near forest areas,
we can start honey collection centres
where farmers can come and sell wild
honey. It is also possible to set up
industries that process vegetables and
agricultural produce like potato,
sweet potato, rice, wheat, tomato,
fruits, which can be sold in outside
markets. 
This 
will 
provide
employment in industries located in
semi-rural areas and not necessarily
in large urban centres.
Do you know that in India about

in about 625 districts of India.  It is
called Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act
2005 (MGNREGA 2005). Under
MGNREGA 2005, all those who are
able to, and are in need of, work in
rural areas are guaranteed 100 days
of employment in a year by the
government. If the government fails in
its duty to provide employment, it will
give unemployment allowances to the
people. The types of work that would
in future help to increase the
production from land  will be given
preference under the Act.
many of them may be working as
child labourers.  If these children are
to attend schools, we will require more
buildings, more teachers and other
staff. A study conducted by the
erstwhile Planning Commission  (now
known as NITI Aayog) estimates that
nearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in
the education sector alone. Similarly,
if we are to improve the health
situation, we need many more doctors,
nurses, health workers etc. to work
in rural areas. These are some ways
by which jobs would be created and
we would also be able to address the
important aspects of development
talked about in Chapter 1.
Every state or region has potential
for increasing the income and
employment for people in that area.
It could be tourism, or regional craft
industry, or new services like IT. Some
of these would require proper
planning and support from the
government. For example, the same
study by the Planning Commission
says that if tourism as a sector is
improved, every year we can give
additional employment to more than
35 lakh people.
We must realise that some of the
suggestions discussed above would
take a long time to implement. For the
short-term, we need some quick
measures. Recognising this, the
central government in India made a
law implementing the Right to Work

processes and procedures. Some of
these people may not be employed by
anyone but may work on their own
but they too have to register
themselves with the government and
follow the rules and regulations.

enjoy security of employment. They
are expected to work only a fixed
number of hours. If they work more,
they have to be paid overtime by the
employer. They also get several other
benefits from the employers. What are

these benefits? They get paid leave,
payment during holidays, provident
fund, gratuity etc. They are supposed
to get medical benefits and, under the
laws, the factory manager has to
ensure facilities like drinking water
and a safe working environment.
When they retire, these workers get
pensions as well.
In contrast, Kamal works in the
unorganised sector. The unorganised
sector is characterised by small and
scattered units which are largely
outside the control of the government.
There are rules and regulations but
these are not followed. Jobs here are
low-paid and often not regular. There
is no provision for overtime, paid
leave, holidays, leave due to sickness
etc. Employment is not secure. People
can be asked to leave without any
reason. When there is less work, such
as during some seasons, some people
may be asked to leave. A lot also
depends on the whims of the
employer. This sector includes a large
number of people who are employed
on their own doing small jobs such
as selling on the street or doing repair
work. Similarly, farmers work on
their own and hire labourers as and
when they require.

How to Protect Workers in
the Unorganised Sector?
The organised sector offers jobs that
are the most sought-after. But the
employment opportunities in the
organised sector have been expanding
very slowly. It is also common to find
many organised sector enterprises in
the unorganised sector. They adopt
such strategies to evade taxes and
refuse to follow laws that protect
labourers. As a result, a large number
of workers are forced to enter the
unorganised sector jobs, which pay a
very low salary. They are often
exploited and not paid a fair wage.
Their earnings are low and not
regular. These jobs are not secure and
have no other benefits.
Since the 1990s, it is also common
to see a large number of workers
losing their jobs in the organised
sector. These workers are forced to
take up jobs in the unorganised
sector with low earnings. Hence,
besides the need for more work, there
is also a need for protection and
support of the workers in the
unorganised sector.
Who are these vulnerable people
who need protection? In the rural
areas, the unorganised sector mostly
comprises of landless agricultural
labourers, small and marginal
farmers, sharecroppers and artisans
(such as weavers, blacksmiths,
carpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly
80 per cent of rural households in
India are in small and marginal
farmer category. These farmers need
to be supported through adequate
facility for timely delivery of seeds,
agricultural inputs, credit, storage
facilities and marketing outlets.
In the urban areas, unorganised
sector comprises mainly of workers in
small-scale industry, casual workers
in construction, trade and transport
etc., and those who work as street
vendors, head load workers, garment
makers, rag pickers etc. Small-scale
industry also needs government’s
support for procuring raw material
and marketing of output. The casual
workers in both rural and urban
areas need to be protected.
We also find that majority of
workers from scheduled castes, tribes
and backward communities
find themselves in the
unorganised sector. Besides
getting the irregular and low
paid work, these workers also
face social discrimination.
Protection and support to
the unorganised sector
workers is thus necessary
for both economic and
social development.
When factories close down, many
once regular workers are found
selling goods or pushing a cart or
doing some other odd job

LET’S RECALL
With so many activities taking place around us, one needs to use the
process of classification to think in a useful manner. The criterion for
classification could be many depending on what we desire to find out.
The process of classification helps to analyse a situation.
In dividing the economic activities into three sectors — primary,
secondary, tertiary — the criterion used was the ‘nature of activity’. On
the basis of this classification, we were able to analyse the pattern of total
production and employment in India. Similarly, we divided the economic
activities into organised and unorganised and used the classification to
look at employment in the two sectors.
What was the most important conclusion that was derived from the
classification exercises? What were the problems and solutions that were
indicated? Can you summarise the information in the following table?
TABLE 2.4 CLASSIFYING ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
Another way of classifying economic
activities into sectors could be on the
basis of who owns assets and is
responsible for the delivery of services.
In the public sector, the government
owns most of the assets and provides
all the services. In the private sector,
ownership of assets and delivery of
services is in the hands of private
individuals or companies. Railways or
post office is an example of the public
sector whereas companies like Tata
Iron and Steel Company Limited
(TISCO) or Reliance Industries
Limited (RIL) are privately owned.
Activities in the private sector are
guided by the motive to earn profits.
To get such services we have to pay
money to these individuals and
companies. The purpose of the public
sector is not just to earn profits.
Governments raise money through
taxes and other ways to meet expenses
on the services rendered by it. Modern
day governments spend on a whole
range of activities. What are these
activities? Why do governments spend
on such activities? Let’s find out.
There are several things needed by
the society as a whole but which the
private sector  will not provide at

of the private sector. Also, collecting
money from thousands of people who
use these facilities is not easy. Even
if they do provide these things they
would charge a high rate for their
use. Examples are construction of
roads, bridges, railways, harbours,
generating electricity, providing
irrigation through dams etc.  Thus,
governments have to undertake such
heavy  spending and ensure that
these facilities are available for
everyone.
There are some activities, which
the government has to support. The
private sector may not continue their
production or business unless
government encourages it. For
example, selling electricity at the cost
of generation may push up the costs
of production of goods in many
industries. Many units, especially
small-scale units, might have to shut
down. Government here steps in by
producing and supplying electricity
at rates which these industries can
afford. Government has to bear part
of the cost.
Similarly, the Government in India
buys wheat and rice from farmers at
a ‘fair price’. This it stores in its
godowns and sells at a lower price to
consumers through ration shops. You
have read about this in the chapter
on Food Security in Class IX. The
government has to bear some of the
cost. In this way, the government
supports 
both 
farmers 
and
consumers.
There are a large number of
activities which are the primary
responsibility of the government. The
government must spend on these.
Providing health and education
facilities for all is one example. We have
discussed some of these issues in the
first chapter. Running proper schools
and providing quality education,
particularly elementary education, is
the duty of the government. India’s size
of illiterate population is one of the
largest in the world.
Similarly, we know that nearly half
of India’s children are malnourished
and a quarter of them are critically
ill. We have read about Infant
Mortality Rates. The infant mortality
rate of Odisha (36) or Madhya
Pradesh (43) is higher than some of
the poorest regions of the world.
Government also needs to pay
attention to aspects of human
development such as availability of
safe drinking water, housing facilities
for the poor and food and nutrition.
It is also the duty of the government
to take care of the poorest and most
ignored regions of the country through
increased spending in such areas.
SUMMING UP
In this chapter we have looked at ways of
classifying economic activities into some
meaningful groups. One way of doing this
is to examine whether the activity relates to
the primary, secondary or tertiary sectors.
The data for India, for the last thirty years,
shows that while  goods and services
produced in the tertiary sector contribute
the most to GDP, the employment remains
in the primary sector. We have also seen
what all can be done for increasing
employment opportunities in the country.
Another classification is to consider whether
people are working in organised or
unorganised sectors. Most people are
working in the unorganised sectors and
protection is necessary for them. We also
looked at the difference between private and
public activities, and why it is important
for public activities to focus on certain areas.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
1  The Pre-modern World
When we talk of ‘globalisation’ we often refer to an economic
system that has emerged since the last 50 years or so. But as you will
see in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long
history – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the
movement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic
and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today,
we need to understand the phases through which this world in
which we live has emerged.
All through history, human societies have become steadily more
interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and
pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and
spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods,
money, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases.
As early as 3000 BCE an active coastal trade linked the Indus valley
civilisations with present-day West Asia. For more than a millennia,
cowries (the Hindi cowdi or seashells, used as a form of currency)
from the Maldives found their way to China and East Africa. The
long-distance spread of disease-carrying germs may be traced as
far back as the seventh century. By the thirteenth century it had
become an unmistakable link.

1.1 Silk Routes Link the World
The silk routes are a good example of vibrant pre-modern trade
and cultural links between distant parts of the world. The name ‘silk
routes’ points to the importance of West-bound Chinese silk cargoes
along this route. Historians have identified several silk routes, over
land and by sea, knitting together vast regions of Asia, and linking
Asia with Europe and northern Africa. They are known to have
existed since before the Christian Era and thrived almost till the
fifteenth century. But Chinese pottery also travelled the same route,
as did textiles and spices from India and Southeast Asia. In return,
precious metals – gold and silver – flowed from Europe to Asia.
Trade and cultural exchange always went hand in hand. Early
Christian missionaries almost certainly travelled this route to Asia, as
did early Muslim preachers a few centuries later. Much before all
this, Buddhism emerged from eastern India and spread in several
directions through intersecting points on the silk routes.
1.2 Food Travels: Spaghetti and Potato
Food offers many examples of long-distance cultural exchange.
Traders and travellers introduced new crops to the lands they
travelled. Even ‘ready’ foodstuff  in distant parts of the world might
share common origins. Take spaghetti and noodles. It is believed
that noodles travelled west from China to
become spaghetti. Or, perhaps Arab traders
took pasta to fifth-century Sicily, an island now
in Italy. Similar foods were also known in India
and Japan, so the truth about their origins may
never be known. Yet such guesswork suggests
the possibilities of long-distance cultural contact
even in the pre-modern world.
Many of our common foods such as potatoes,
soya, groundnuts, maize, tomatoes, chillies,
sweet potatoes, and so on were not known to
our ancestors until about five centuries ago.
These foods were only introduced in Europe
and Asia after Christopher Columbus
accidentally discovered the vast continent that
would later become known as the Americas.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
(Here we will use ‘America’ to describe North America, South
America and the Caribbean.) In fact, many of our common foods
came from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.
Sometimes the new crops could make the difference between life
and death. Europe’s poor began to eat better and live longer with
the introduction of the humble potato. Ireland’s poorest peasants
became so dependent on potatoes that when disease destroyed the
potato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died
of starvation.
1.3 Conquest, Disease and Trade
The pre-modern world shrank greatly in the sixteenth century after
European sailors found a sea route to Asia and also successfully
crossed the western ocean to America. For centuries before, the
Indian Ocean had known a bustling trade, with goods, people,
knowledge, customs, etc. criss-crossing its waters. The Indian
subcontinent was central to these flows and a crucial point in their
networks.  The entry of the Europeans helped expand or redirect
some of these flows towards Europe.
Before its ‘discovery’, America had been cut off from regular contact
with the rest of the world for millions of years. But from the sixteenth
century, its vast lands and abundant crops and minerals began to
transform trade and lives everywhere.
Precious metals, particularly silver, from mines located in present-
day Peru and Mexico also enhanced Europe’s wealth and financed
its trade with Asia. Legends spread in seventeenth-century Europe
about South America’s fabled wealth. Many expeditions set off in
search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.
The Portuguese and Spanish conquest and colonisation of America
was decisively under way by the mid-sixteenth century.  European
conquest was not just a result of superior firepower. In fact, the
most powerful weapon of the Spanish conquerors was not a
conventional military weapon at all. It was the germs such as those
of smallpox that they carried on their person. Because of their long
isolation, America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against
these diseases that came from Europe. Smallpox in particular proved
a deadly killer. Once introduced, it spread deep into the continent,
ahead even of any Europeans reaching there. It killed and decimated
whole communities, paving the way for conquest.

London News, 1849.

Famine (1845 to 1849), around 1,000,000

number emigrated in search of work.
‘Biological’ warfare?
John Winthorp, the first governor of  the
Massachusetts Bay colony in New England,
wrote in May 1634 that smallpox signalled God’s
blessing for the colonists: ‘… the natives … were
neere (near) all dead of small Poxe (pox), so as
the Lord hathe (had) cleared our title to what
we possess’.

Discuss
Guns could be bought or captured and turned against the invaders.
But not diseases such as smallpox to which the conquerors were
mostly immune.
Until the nineteenth century, poverty and hunger were common in
Europe. Cities were crowded and deadly diseases were widespread.
Religious conflicts were common, and religious dissenters were
persecuted. Thousands therefore fled Europe for America. Here,
by the eighteenth century, plantations worked by slaves captured
in Africa were growing cotton and sugar for European markets.
Until well into the eighteenth century, China and India were among
the world’s richest countries. They were also pre-eminent in Asian
trade. However, from the fifteenth century, China is said to have
restricted overseas contacts and retreated into isolation.  China’s
reduced role and the rising importance of the Americas gradually
moved the centre of world trade westwards. Europe now emerged
as the centre of  world trade.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic,
political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in
complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.
Economists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within
international economic exchanges. The first is the flow of trade which
in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g.,
cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration
of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of
capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.
All three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives
more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could
sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often
more restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand
the nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the
three flows together.
2.1 A World Economy Takes Shape
A good place to start is the changing pattern of food production
and consumption in industrial Europe. Traditionally, countries liked
to be self-sufficient in food. But in nineteenth-century Britain,
self-sufficiency in food meant lower living standards and social
conflict. Why was this so?
Population growth from the late eighteenth century had increased
the demand for food grains in Britain. As urban centres expanded
and industry grew, the demand for agricultural products went
up, pushing up food grain prices. Under pressure from landed
groups, the government also restricted the import of corn. The
laws allowing the government to do this were commonly known as
the ‘Corn Laws’. Unhappy with high food prices, industrialists and
urban dwellers forced the abolition of the Corn Laws.
After the Corn Laws were scrapped, food could be imported into
Britain more cheaply than it could be produced within the country.
British agriculture was unable to compete with imports.  Vast areas
of land were now left uncultivated, and thousands of men and
women were thrown out of work. They flocked to the cities or
migrated overseas.

Reprint 2025-26
India and the Contemporary World
58
As food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. From the mid-
nineteenth century, faster industrial growth in Britain also led to higher
incomes, and therefore more food imports. Around the world – in
Eastern Europe, Russia, America and Australia  –  lands were cleared
and food production expanded to meet the British demand.
It was not enough merely to clear lands for agriculture. Railways
were needed to link the agricultural regions to the ports. New
harbours had to be built and old ones expanded to ship the new
cargoes. People had to settle on the lands to bring them under
cultivation. This meant building homes and settlements. All these
activities in turn required capital and labour. Capital flowed from
financial centres such as London. The demand for labour in places
where labour was in short supply – as in America and Australia –
led to more migration.
Nearly 50 million people emigrated from Europe to America and
Australia in the nineteenth century. All over the world some 150
million are estimated to have left their homes, crossed oceans and
vast distances over land in search of a better future.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
Prepare a flow chart to show how Britain’s
decision to import food led to increased
migration to America and Australia.
Activity
Thus by 1890, a global agricultural economy had taken shape,
accompanied by complex changes in labour movement patterns,
capital flows, ecologies and technology. Food no longer came from
a nearby village or town, but from thousands of miles away. It was
not grown by a peasant tilling his own land, but by an agricultural
worker, perhaps recently arrived, who was now working on a large
farm that only a generation ago had most likely been a forest. It was
transported by railway, built for that very purpose, and by ships
which were increasingly manned in these decades by low-paid
workers from southern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.
Imagine that you are an agricultural worker who has arrived in
America from Ireland. Write a paragraph on why you chose to
come and how you are earning your living.
Activity
Some of this dramatic change, though on a smaller scale, occurred
closer home in west Punjab. Here the British Indian government
built a network of irrigation canals to transform semi-desert wastes
into fertile agricultural lands that could grow wheat and cotton for
export. The Canal Colonies, as the areas irrigated by the new canals
were called, were settled by peasants from other parts of Punjab.
Of course, food is merely an example. A similar story can be told
for cotton, the cultivation of which expanded worldwide to feed
British textile mills. Or rubber. Indeed, so rapidly did regional
specialisation in the production of commodities develop, that
between 1820 and 1914 world trade is estimated to have multiplied
25 to 40 times. Nearly 60 per cent of this trade comprised ‘primary
products’ – that is, agricultural products such as wheat and cotton,
and minerals such as coal.
2.2 Role of Technology
What was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships,
the telegraph, for example, were important inventions without
which we cannot imagine the transformed nineteenth-century world.
But technological advances were often the result of larger social,
political and economic factors. For example, colonisation stimulated
new investments and improvements in transport: faster railways,
lighter wagons and larger ships helped move food more cheaply
and quickly from faraway farms to final markets.
Reprint 2025-26

The trade in meat offers a good example of this connected process.
Till the 1870s, animals were shipped live from America to Europe
and then slaughtered when they arrived there. But live animals took
up a lot of ship space. Many also died in voyage, fell ill, lost weight,
or became unfit to eat. Meat was hence an expensive luxury beyond
the reach of the European poor. High prices in turn kept demand
and production down until the development of a new technology,
namely, refrigerated ships, which enabled the transport of perishable
foods over long distances.
Now animals were slaughtered for food at the starting point – in
America, Australia or New Zealand – and then transported to
Europe as frozen meat. This reduced shipping costs and lowered
meat prices in Europe. The poor in Europe could now consume
a more varied diet. To the earlier monotony of bread and potatoes
many, though not all, could now add meat (and butter and eggs)
to their diet. Better living conditions promoted social peace within
the country and support for imperialism abroad.
2.3 Late nineteenth-century Colonialism
Trade flourished and markets expanded in the late nineteenth
century. But this was not only a period of expanding trade and
increased prosperity. It is important to realise that there was a
darker side to this process.  In many parts of the world, the
expansion of trade and a closer relationship with the world
economy also meant a loss of freedoms and livelihoods. Late-
nineteenth-century European conquests produced many painful
economic, social and ecological changes through which the
colonised societies were brought into the world economy.

centres of the country.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
Look at a map of Africa (Fig. 10). You
will see some countries’ borders run
straight, as if they were drawn using a
ruler. Well, in fact this was almost how
rival European powers in Africa drew up
the borders demarcating their respective
territories. In 1885 the big European
powers met in Berlin to complete the
carving up of Africa between them.
Britain and France made vast additions to
their overseas territories in the late nineteenth
century. Belgium and Germany became new
colonial powers. The US also became a
colonial power in the late 1890s by taking
over some colonies earlier held by Spain.
Let us look at one example of the destructive
impact of colonialism on the economy and
livelihoods of colonised people.
Sir Henry Morton Stanley in Central
Africa
Stanley was a journalist and explorer sent
by the New York Herald to find Livingston,
a missionary and explorer who had been in
Africa for several years. Like other European
and American explorers of the time, Stanley
went with arms, mobilised local hunters,
warriors and labourers to help him, fought
with local tribes, investigated African
terrains, and mapped different regions.
These explorations helped the conquest
of Africa. Geographical explorations were
not driven by an innocent search for
scientific information. They were directly
linked to imperial projects.

2.4 Rinderpest, or the Cattle Plague
In Africa, in the 1890s, a fast-spreading disease of cattle plague
or Rinderpest had a terrifying impact on people’s
livelihoods and the local economy. This is a good example
of the widespread European imperial impact on colonised
societies. It shows how in this era of conquest even a disease
affecting cattle reshaped the lives and fortunes of thousands
of people and their relations with the rest of the world.
Historically, Africa had abundant land and a relatively small
population. For centuries, land and livestock sustained African
livelihoods and people rarely worked for a wage. In late-
nineteenth-century Africa there were few consumer goods that
wages could buy. If you had been an African possessing land
and livestock – and there was plenty of both – you too would
have seen little reason to work for a wage.
In the late nineteenth century, Europeans were attracted to
Africa due to its vast resources of land and minerals. Europeans
came to Africa hoping to establish plantations and mines to
produce crops and minerals for export to Europe. But there
was an unexpected problem – a shortage of labour willing to
work for wages.
Employers used many methods to recruit and retain labour. Heavy
taxes were imposed which could be paid only by working for wages
on plantations and mines. Inheritance laws were changed so that

Crossing the Wilge river was the quickest method of
transport to the gold fields of Transvaal. After the
discovery of gold in Witwatersrand, Europeans
rushed to the region despite their fear of disease and
death, and the difficulties of the journey. By the
1890s, South Africa contributed over 20 per cent of
the world gold production.

peasants were displaced from land:  only one member of a family
was allowed to inherit land, as a result of which the others were
pushed into the labour market. Mineworkers were also confined in
compounds and not allowed to move about freely.
Then came Rinderpest, a devastating cattle disease.
Rinderpest arrived in Africa in the late 1880s.  It was carried by
infected cattle imported from British Asia to feed the Italian soldiers
invading Eritrea in East Africa. Entering Africa in the east, rinderpest
moved west ‘like forest fire’, reaching Africa’s Atlantic coast in 1892.
It reached the Cape (Africa’s southernmost tip) five years later. Along
the way rinderpest killed 90 per cent of the cattle.
The loss of cattle destroyed African livelihoods. Planters, mine owners
and colonial governments now successfully monopolised what scarce
cattle resources remained, to strengthen their power and to force
Africans into the labour market. Control over the scarce resource
of cattle enabled European colonisers to conquer and subdue Africa.
Similar stories can be told about the impact of Western conquest on
other parts of the nineteenth-century world.
2.4 Indentured Labour Migration from India
The example of indentured labour migration from India also
illustrates the two-sided nature of the nineteenth-century world.
It was a world of faster economic growth as well as great misery,
higher incomes for some and poverty for others, technological
advances in some areas and new forms of coercion in others.
In the nineteenth century, hundreds of thousands of Indian and
Chinese labourers went to work on plantations, in mines, and in
road and railway construction projects around the world. In India,
indentured labourers were hired under contracts which promised
return travel to India after they had worked five years on their
employer’s plantation.
Most Indian indentured workers came from the present-day regions
of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, central India and the dry districts
of Tamil Nadu. In the mid-nineteenth century these regions
experienced many changes – cottage industries declined, land rents
rose, lands were cleared for mines and plantations. All this affected
the lives of the poor: they failed to pay their rents, became deeply
indebted and were forced to migrate in search of work.

Discuss the importance of language and
popular traditions in the creation of national
identity.
The main destinations of Indian indentured
migrants were the Caribbean islands (mainly
Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam), Mauritius and Fiji.
Closer home, Tamil migrants went to Ceylon and
Malaya. Indentured workers were also recruited
for tea plantations in Assam.
Recruitment was done by agents engaged by
employers and paid a small commission. Many
migrants agreed to take up work hoping to escape
poverty or oppression in their home villages.
Agents also tempted the prospective migrants
by providing false information about final
destinations, modes of travel, the nature of the
work, and living and working conditions. Often
migrants were not even told that they were to embark on a long
sea voyage. Sometimes agents even forcibly abducted less
willing migrants.
Nineteenth-century indenture has been described as a ‘new system
of slavery’. On arrival at the plantations, labourers found conditions
to be different from what they had imagined. Living and working
conditions were harsh, and there were few legal rights.
But workers discovered their own ways of surviving. Many of them
escaped into the wilds, though if caught they faced severe punishment.
Others developed new forms of individual and collective self-
expression, blending different cultural forms, old and new. In
Trinidad the annual Muharram procession was transformed into a
riotous carnival called ‘Hosay’ (for Imam Hussain) in which workers
of all races and religions joined. Similarly, the protest religion of
Rastafarianism (made famous by the Jamaican reggae star Bob
Marley) is also said to reflect social and cultural links with Indian
migrants to the Caribbean. ‘Chutney music’, popular in Trinidad
and Guyana, is another creative contemporary expression of the
post-indenture experience. These forms of cultural fusion are part
of the making of the global world, where things from different
places get mixed, lose their original characteristics and become
something entirely new.
Most indentured workers stayed on after their contracts ended, or
returned to their new homes after a short spell in India. Consequently,
there are large communities of people of Indian descent in these
countries. Have you heard of the Nobel Prize-winning writer

West Indies cricketers Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh
Sarwan. If you have wondered why their names sound vaguely
Indian, the answer is that they are descended from indentured
labour migrants from India.
From the 1900s India’s nationalist leaders began opposing the system
of indentured labour migration as abusive and cruel. It was abolished
in 1921. Yet for a number of decades afterwards, descendants of
Indian indentured workers, often thought of as ‘coolies’, remained
an uneasy minority in the Caribbean islands. Some of Naipaul’s
early novels capture their sense of loss and alienation.
2.5 Indian Entrepreneurs Abroad
Growing food and other crops for the world market required
capital. Large plantations could borrow it from banks and
markets. But what about the humble peasant?
Enter the Indian banker. Do you know of the Shikaripuri
Shroffs and Nattukottai  Chettiars? They were amongst the
many groups of bankers and traders who financed export
agriculture in Central and Southeast Asia, using either their own
funds or those borrowed from European banks. They had a
sophisticated system to transfer money over large distances, and
even developed indigenous forms of corporate organisation.
Indian traders and moneylenders also followed European
colonisers into Africa. Hyderabadi Sindhi traders, however,
ventured beyond European colonies. From the 1860s they
established flourishing emporia at busy ports worldwide, selling
local and imported curios to tourists whose numbers were
beginning to swell, thanks to the development of safe and
comfortable passenger vessels.
2.6 Indian Trade, Colonialism and the Global System
Historically, fine cottons produced in India were exported  to
Europe. With industrialisation, British cotton manufacture
began to expand, and industrialists pressurised the government
to restrict cotton imports and protect local industries. Tariffs
were imposed on cloth imports into Britain. Consequently, the
inflow of fine Indian cotton began to decline.
From the early nineteenth century, British manufacturers also began
to seek overseas markets for their cloth. Excluded from the British

market by tariff barriers, Indian textiles now faced stiff competition
in other international markets. If we look at the figures of exports
from India, we see a steady decline of the share of cotton textiles:
from some 30 per cent around 1800 to 15 per cent by 1815. By the
1870s this proportion had dropped to below 3 per cent.
What, then, did India export? The figures again tell a dramatic
story.  While exports of manufactures declined rapidly, export of
raw materials increased equally fast. Between 1812 and 1871, the
share of raw cotton exports rose from 5 per cent to 35 per cent.

many decades. And, as you have read last year, opium shipments to
China grew rapidly from the 1820s to become for a while India’s
single largest export. Britain grew opium in India and exported it to
China and, with the money earned through this sale, it financed its
tea and other imports from China.
Over the nineteenth century, British manufactures flooded the Indian
market. Food grain and raw material exports from India to Britain
and the rest of the world increased. But the value of British exports
to India was much higher than the value of British imports from
India. Thus Britain had a ‘trade surplus’ with India. Britain used this
surplus to balance its trade deficits with other countries – that is,
with countries from which Britain was importing more than it was
selling to. This is how a multilateral settlement system works – it
allows one country’s deficit with another country to be settled
by its surplus with a third country. By helping Britain balance its
deficits,  India played a crucial role in the late-nineteenth-century
world economy.
Britain’s trade surplus in India also helped pay the so-called ‘home
charges’ that included private remittances home by British officials
and traders, interest payments on India’s external debt, and pensions
of British officials in India.

3  The Inter-war Economy
The First World War (1914-18) was mainly fought in Europe. But
its impact was felt around the world. Notably for our concerns
in this chapter, it plunged the first half of the twentieth century
into a crisis that took over three decades to overcome. During
this period the world experienced widespread economic and
political instability, and another catastrophic war.
3.1 Wartime Transformations
The First World War, as you know, was fought between two power
blocs. On the one side were the Allies – Britain, France and Russia
(later joined by the US); and on the opposite side were the Central
Powers – Germany, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey.  When
the war began in August 1914, many governments thought it would
be over by Christmas. It lasted more than four years.
The First World War was a war like no other before. The fighting
involved the world’s leading industrial nations which now
harnessed the vast powers of modern industry to inflict the greatest
possible destruction on their enemies.
This war was thus the first modern industrial war. It saw the use
of machine guns, tanks, aircraft, chemical weapons, etc. on a
massive scale. These were all increasingly products of modern large-
scale industry. To fight the war, millions of soldiers
had to be recruited from around the world and
moved to the frontlines on large ships and trains.
The scale of death and destruction – 9 million dead
and 20 million injured – was unthinkable before the
industrial age, without the use of industrial arms.
Most of the killed and maimed were men of
working age. These deaths and injuries reduced the
able-bodied workforce in Europe. With fewer
numbers within the family, household incomes
declined after the war.
During the war, industries were restructured to
produce war-related goods. Entire societies were
also reorganised for war – as men went to battle,
women stepped in to undertake jobs that earlier only
men were expected to do.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
The war led to the snapping of economic links between some of
the world’s largest economic powers which were now fighting
each other to pay for them. So Britain borrowed large sums
of money from US banks as well as the US public. Thus the war
transformed the US from being an international debtor to an
international creditor. In other words, at the war’s end, the US and
its citizens owned more overseas assets than foreign governments
and citizens owned in the US.
3.2 Post-war Recovery
Post-war economic recovery proved difficult. Britain, which was
the world’s leading economy in the pre-war period, in particular
faced a prolonged crisis. While Britain was preoccupied with war,
industries had developed in India and Japan. After the war Britain
found it difficult to recapture its earlier position of dominance in
the Indian market, and to compete with Japan internationally.
Moreover, to finance war expenditures Britain had borrowed liberally
from the US. This meant that at the end of the war Britain was
burdened with huge external debts.
The war had led to an economic boom, that is, to a large increase in
demand, production and employment. When the war boom ended,
production contracted and unemployment increased. At the
same time the government reduced bloated war expenditures to
bring them into line with peacetime revenues. These developments
led to huge job losses – in 1921 one in every five British workers
was out of work. Indeed, anxiety and uncertainty about work
became an enduring part of the post-war scenario.
Many agricultural economies were also in crisis. Consider the case
of wheat producers. Before the war, eastern Europe was a major
supplier of wheat in the world market. When this supply was
disrupted during the war, wheat production in Canada, America
and Australia expanded dramatically. But once the war was over,
production in eastern Europe revived and created a glut in wheat
output. Grain prices fell, rural incomes declined, and farmers fell
deeper into debt.
3.3 Rise of Mass Production and Consumption
In the US, recovery was quicker. We have already seen how the war
helped boost the US economy. After a short period of economic
Reprint 2025-26

70
trouble in the years after the war, the US  economy resumed
its strong growth in the early 1920s.
One important feature of the US economy of the 1920s
was mass production. The move towards mass production
had begun in the late nineteenth century, but in the 1920s it
became a characteristic feature of industrial production in
the US. A well-known pioneer of mass production was the
car manufacturer Henry Ford. He adapted the assembly line
of a Chicago slaughterhouse (in which slaughtered animals
were picked apart by butchers as they came down a conveyor
belt) to his new car plant in Detroit. He realised that the
‘assembly line’ method would allow a faster and cheaper way
of producing vehicles. The assembly line forced workers to
repeat a single task mechanically and continuously – such as
fitting a particular part to the car – at a pace dictated by the
conveyor belt. This was a way of increasing the output per worker
by speeding up the pace of work. Standing in front of a conveyor
belt no worker could afford to delay the motions, take a break, or
even have a friendly word with a workmate. As a result, Henry
Ford’s cars came off the assembly line at three-minute intervals, a
speed much faster than that achieved by previous methods. The T-
Model Ford was the world’s first mass-produced car.
At first workers at the Ford  factory were unable to cope with the
stress of working on assembly lines in which they could not control
the pace of work. So they quit in large numbers. In desperation
Ford doubled the daily wage to $5 in January 1914. At the same
time he banned trade unions from operating in his plants.
Henry Ford recovered the high wage by repeatedly speeding up
the production line and forcing workers to work ever harder. So
much so, he would soon describe his decision to double the daily
wage as the ‘best cost-cutting decision’ he had ever made.
Fordist industrial practices soon spread in the US. They were also
widely copied in Europe in the 1920s. Mass production lowered
costs and prices of engineered goods. Thanks to higher wages,
more workers could now afford to purchase durable consumer
goods such as cars. Car production in the US rose from 2 million in
1919 to more than 5 million in 1929. Similarly, there was a spurt
in the purchase of refrigerators, washing machines, radios,
gramophone players, all through a system of ‘hire purchase’ (i.e., on
Fig. 21 – T-Model automobiles lined up outside the
factory.

71
The  Making  of  a  Global  World
credit repaid in weekly or monthly instalments). The demand
for refrigerators, washing machines, etc. was also fuelled by a boom
in house construction and home ownership, financed once again
by loans.
The housing and consumer boom of the 1920s created the basis of
prosperity in the US. Large investments in housing and household
goods seemed to create a cycle of higher employment
and incomes, rising consumption demand, more investment, and
yet more employment and incomes.
In 1923, the US resumed exporting capital to the rest of the world
and became the largest overseas lender. US imports and capital
exports also boosted European recovery and world trade and
income growth over the next six years.
All this, however, proved  too good to last. By 1929 the world
would be plunged into a depression such as it had never
experienced before.
3.4 The Great Depression
The Great Depression began around 1929 and lasted till the mid-
1930s. During this period most parts of the world experienced
catastrophic declines in production, employment, incomes and
trade. The exact timing and impact of the depression varied
across countries. But in general, agricultural regions and communities
were the worst affected. This was because the fall
in agricultural prices was greater and more prolonged than that
in the prices of industrial goods.
The depression was caused by a combination of several factors. We
have already seen how fragile the post-war world economy was.
First: agricultural overproduction remained a problem. This was
made worse by falling agricultural prices. As prices slumped and
agricultural incomes declined, farmers tried to expand production
and bring a larger volume of produce to the market to maintain
their overall income. This worsened the glut in the market, pushing
down prices even further. Farm produce rotted for a lack of buyers.
Second: in the mid-1920s, many countries financed their investments
through loans from the US. While it was often extremely easy to
raise loans in the US when the going was good, US overseas lenders
panicked at the first sign of trouble. In the first half of 1928, US
Many years later, Dorothea Lange, the
photographer who shot this picture, recollected
the moment of her encounter with the
hungry mother:
‘I saw and approached the hungry and desperate
mother, as if drawn by a magnet … I did not ask
her name or her history. She told me her age,
that she was thirty-two. She said that they
(i.e., she and her seven children) had been living
on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields,
and birds that the children killed … There she
sat … with her children huddled around her,
and seemed to know that my pictures might
help her, and so she helped me …’

overseas loans amounted to over $ 1 billion. A year later it was one
quarter of that amount. Countries that depended crucially on US
loans now faced an acute crisis.
The withdrawal of US loans affected much of the rest of the world,
though in different ways. In Europe it led to the failure of some
major banks and the collapse of currencies such as the British pound
sterling. In Latin America and elsewhere it intensified the slump
in agricultural and raw material prices. The US attempt to protect
its economy in the depression by doubling import duties also dealt
another severe blow to world trade.
The US was also the industrial country most severely affected by
the depression. With the fall in prices and the prospect of a
depression, US banks had also slashed domestic lending and
called back loans. Farms could not sell their harvests, households
were ruined, and businesses collapsed. Faced with falling
incomes, many households in the US could not repay what they had
borrowed, and were forced to give up their homes, cars and other
consumer durables. The consumerist prosperity of the 1920s now
disappeared in a puff of dust. As unemployment soared, people
trudged long distances looking for any work they could find.
Ultimately, the US banking system itself collapsed. Unable to
recover investments, collect loans and repay depositors, thousands
of banks went bankrupt and were forced to close. The numbers
are phenomenal: by 1933 over 4,000 banks had closed and
between 1929 and 1932 about 110, 000 companies had collapsed.
By 1935, a modest economic recovery was under way in most
industrial countries. But the Great Depression’s wider effects on
society, politics and international relations, and on peoples’ minds,
proved more enduring.
3.5 India and the Great Depression
If we look at the impact of the depression on India we realise
how integrated the global economy had become by the early
twentieth century. The tremors of a crisis in one part of the world
were quickly relayed to other parts, affecting lives, economies and
societies worldwide.
In the nineteenth century, as you have seen, colonial India had become
an exporter of agricultural goods and importer of manufactures.
The depression immediately affected Indian trade. India’s exports

and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. As international
prices crashed, prices in India also plunged. Between 1928 and 1934,
wheat prices in India fell by 50 per cent.
Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though
agricultural prices fell sharply, the colonial government refused to
reduce revenue demands. Peasants producing for the world market
were the worst hit.
Consider the jute producers of Bengal. They grew raw jute that was
processed in factories for export in the form of gunny bags. But
as gunny exports collapsed, the price of raw jute crashed more than
60 per cent. Peasants who borrowed in the hope of better times or
to increase output in the hope of higher incomes faced ever lower
prices, and fell deeper and deeper into debt. Thus the Bengal jute
growers’ lament:
Across India, peasants’ indebtedness increased. They used up their
savings, mortgaged lands, and sold whatever jewellery and precious
metals they had to meet their expenses. In these depression years,
India became an exporter of precious metals, notably gold.
The famous economist John Maynard Keynes thought that Indian
gold exports promoted global economic recovery. They certainly
helped speed up Britain’s recovery, but did little for the Indian peasant.
Rural India was thus seething with unrest when Mahatma Gandhi
launched the civil disobedience movement at the height of the
depression in 1931.
The depression proved less grim for urban India. Because of falling
prices, those with fixed incomes – say town-dwelling landowners
who received rents and middle-class salaried employees – now found
themselves better off. Everything cost less. Industrial investment also
grew as the government extended tariff protection to industries,
under the pressure of nationalist opinion.

4  Rebuilding a World Economy: The Post-war Era
The Second World War broke out a mere two decades after the
end of the First World War. It was fought between the Axis powers
(mainly Nazi Germany, Japan and Italy)  and the Allies (Britain,
France, the Soviet Union and the US). It was a war waged for six
years on many fronts, in many places, over land, on sea, in the air.
Once again death and destruction was enormous. At least 60 million
people, or about 3 per cent of the world’s 1939 population, are
believed to have been killed, directly or indirectly, as a result of the
war. Millions more were injured.
Unlike in earlier wars, most of these deaths took place outside the
battlefields. Many more civilians than soldiers died from war-related
causes. Vast parts of Europe and Asia were devastated, and several
cities were destroyed by aerial bombardment or relentless
artillery attacks. The war caused an immense amount of economic
devastation and social disruption. Reconstruction promised to
be long and difficult.
Two crucial influences shaped post-war
reconstruction. The first was the US’s
emergence as the dominant economic, political
and military power in the Western world. The
second was the dominance of the Soviet
Union. It had made huge sacrifices to defeat
Nazi Germany, and transformed itself from
a backward agricultural country into a world
power during the very years when the capitalist
world was trapped in the Great Depression.
4.1 Post-war Settlement and the
Bretton Woods Institutions
Economists and politicians drew two key lessons from inter-war
economic experiences. First, an industrial society based on mass
production cannot be sustained without mass consumption. But to
ensure mass consumption, there was a need for high and stable
incomes. Incomes could not be stable if employment was unstable.
Thus stable incomes also required steady, full employment.
But markets alone could not guarantee full employment.
Therefore governments would have to step in to minimise

fluctuations of price, output and employment. Economic stability
could be ensured only through the intervention of the government.
The second lesson related to a country’s economic links with
the outside world. The goal of full employment could only be
achieved if governments had power to control flows of goods,
capital and labour.
Thus in brief, the main aim of the post-war international economic
system was to preserve economic stability and full employment in
the industrial world. Its framework was agreed upon at the United
Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in July 1944 at
Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, USA.
The Bretton Woods conference established the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to deal with external surpluses and deficits of its member
nations. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(popularly known as the World Bank) was set up to finance post-
war reconstruction. The IMF and the World Bank are referred to
as the Bretton Woods institutions or sometimes the Bretton Woods
twins. The post-war international economic system is also often
described as the Bretton Woods system.
The IMF and the World Bank commenced financial operations
in 1947. Decision-making in these institutions is controlled by
the Western industrial powers. The US has an effective right of
veto over key IMF and World Bank decisions.
The international monetary system is the system linking national
currencies and monetary system. The Bretton Woods system was
based on fixed exchange rates. In this system, national currencies,
for example the Indian rupee, were pegged to the dollar at a fixed
exchange rate. The dollar itself was anchored to gold at a fixed
price of $35 per ounce of gold.
4.2 The Early Post-war Years
The Bretton Woods system inaugurated an era of unprecedented
growth of trade and incomes for the Western industrial nations and
Japan. World trade grew annually at over 8 per cent between 1950
and 1970 and incomes at nearly 5 per cent. The growth was also
mostly stable, without large fluctuations. For much of this period
the unemployment rate, for example, averaged less than 5 per cent
in most industrial countries.

enterprise. Developing countries were in a hurry to catch up with
the advanced industrial countries. Therefore, they invested vast
amounts of capital, importing industrial plant and equipment
featuring modern technology.
4.3 Decolonisation and Independence
When the Second World War ended, large parts of the world were
still under European colonial rule. Over the next two decades most
colonies in Asia and Africa emerged as free, independent nations.
They were, however, overburdened by poverty and a lack of
resources, and their economies and societies were handicapped by
long periods of colonial rule.
The IMF and the World Bank were designed to meet the financial
needs of the industrial countries. They were not equipped to cope
with the challenge of poverty and lack of development in the former
colonies. But as Europe and Japan rapidly rebuilt their economies,
they grew less dependent on the IMF and the World Bank. Thus
from the late 1950s the Bretton Woods institutions began to shift
their attention more towards developing countries.
As colonies, many of the less developed regions of the world had
been part of Western empires. Now, ironically, as newly independent
countries facing urgent pressures to lift their populations out of
poverty, they came under the guidance of international agencies
dominated by the former colonial powers. Even after many years
of decolonisation, the former colonial powers still controlled vital
resources such as minerals and land in many of their former colonies.
Large corporations of other powerful countries, for example the
US, also often managed to secure rights to exploit developing
countries’ natural resources very cheaply.
At the same time, most developing countries did not benefit from
the fast growth the Western economies experienced in the 1950s
and 1960s. Therefore they organised themselves as a group – the
Group of 77 (or G-77) – to demand a new international economic
order (NIEO). By the NIEO they meant a system that would give
them real control over their natural resources, more development
assistance, fairer prices for raw materials, and better access for their
manufactured goods in developed countries’ markets.
New words
Tariff – Tax imposed on a country’s imports
from the rest of  the world. Tariffs are

What are MNCs?
Multinational corporations (MNCs) are large
companies that operate in several countries at
the same time. The first MNCs were established
in the 1920s. Many more came up in the 1950s
and 1960s as US businesses expanded worldwide
and Western Europe and Japan also recovered
to become powerful industrial economies. The
worldwide spread of MNCs was a notable feature
of the 1950s and 1960s. This was partly because
high import tariffs imposed by different
governments forced MNCs to locate their
manufacturing operations and become ‘domestic
producers’ in as many countries as possible.

The  Making  of  a  Global  World
4.4 End of Bretton Woods and the Beginning of
‘Globalisation’
Despite years of stable and rapid growth, not all was well in
this post-war world. From the 1960s the rising costs of its
overseas involvements weakened the US’s finances and competitive
strength. The US dollar now no longer commanded confidence
as the world’s principal currency. It could not maintain its value
in relation to gold. This eventually led to the collapse of the
system of fixed exchange rates and the introduction of a system
of floating exchange rates.
From the mid-1970s the international financial system also changed
in important ways. Earlier, developing countries could turn to
international institutions for loans and development assistance. But
now they were forced to borrow from Western commercial banks
and private lending institutions. This led to periodic debt crises in
the developing world, and lower incomes and increased poverty,
especially in Africa and Latin America.
The industrial world was also hit by unemployment that began
rising from the mid-1970s and remained high until the early 1990s.
From the late 1970s MNCs also began to shift production operations
to low-wage Asian countries.
China had been cut off from the post-war world economy since
its revolution in 1949. But new economic policies in China and
the collapse of the Soviet Union and Soviet-style communism in
Eastern Europe brought many countries back into the fold of the
world economy.
Wages were relatively low in countries like China. Thus they became
attractive destinations for investment by foreign MNCs competing
to capture world markets. Have you noticed that most of the TVs,
mobile phones, and toys we see in the shops seem to be made in
China? This is because of the low-cost structure of the Chinese
economy, most importantly its low wages.
The relocation of industry to low-wage countries stimulated world
trade and capital flows. In the last two decades the world’s economic
geography has been transformed as countries such as India, China
and Brazil have undergone rapid economic transformation.

The Age of Industrialisation
In 1900, a popular music publisher E.T. Paull produced a music
book that had a picture on the cover page announcing the ‘Dawn
of the Century’ (Fig. 1). As you can see from the illustration, at the
centre of the picture is a goddess-like figure, the angel of progress,
bearing the flag of the new century. She is gently perched on a wheel
with wings, symbolising time. Her flight is taking her into the future.
Floating about, behind her, are the signs of progress: railway, camera,
machines, printing press and factory.
This glorification of machines and technology is even more marked
in a picture which appeared on the pages of a trade magazine over
a hundred years ago (Fig. 2). It shows two magicians. The one at the

These images offer us a triumphant account of the modern world.
Within this account the modern world is associated with rapid
technological change and innovations, machines and factories, railways
and steamships. The history of industrialisation thus becomes simply
a story of development, and the modern age appears as a wonderful
time of technological progress.
These images and associations have now become part of popular
imagination. Do you not see rapid industrialisation as a time of
progress and modernity? Do you not think that the spread of railways
and factories, and construction of high-rise buildings and bridges is
a sign of society’s development?
How have these images developed? And how do we relate to these
ideas? Is industrialisation always based on rapid technological
development? Can we today continue to glorify continuous
mechanisation of all work? What has industrialisation meant to
people’s lives? To answer such questions we need to turn to the
history of industrialisation.
In this chapter we will look at this history by focusing first on Britain,
the first industrial nation, and then India, where the pattern of
industrial change was conditioned by colonial rule.

1  Before the Industrial Revolution
All too often we associate industrialisation with the growth of
factory industry. When we talk of industrial production we refer
to factory production. When we talk of industrial workers we
mean factory workers. Histories of industrialisation very often begin
with the setting up of the first factories.
There is a problem with such ideas. Even before factories began to
dot the landscape in England and Europe, there was large-scale
industrial production for an international market. This was not based
on factories. Many historians now refer to this phase of
industrialisation as proto-industrialisation.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns
in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to
peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international
market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of
colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods
began growing. But merchants could not expand production within
towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were
powerful. These were associations of producers that trained
craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated
competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into
the trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly
right to produce and trade in specific products. It was
therefore difficult for new merchants to set up
business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.
In the countryside poor peasants and artisans began
working for merchants. As you have seen in the
textbook last year, this was a time when open fields
were disappearing and commons were being
enclosed. Cottagers and poor peasants who had earlier
depended on common lands for their survival,
gathering their firewood, berries, vegetables, hay and
straw, had to now look for alternative sources of
income. Many had tiny plots of land which could not
provide work for all members of the household. So
when merchants came around and offered advances
to produce goods for them, peasant households
eagerly agreed. By working for the merchants, they

could remain in the countryside and continue to cultivate their small
plots. Income from proto-industrial production supplemented their
shrinking income from cultivation. It also allowed them a fuller use
of their family labour resources.
Within this system a close relationship developed between the town
and the countryside. Merchants were based in towns but the work
was done mostly in the countryside. A merchant clothier in England
purchased wool from a wool stapler, and carried it to the spinners;
the yarn (thread) that was spun was taken in subsequent stages
of production to weavers, fullers, and then to dyers. The finishing
was done in London before the export merchant sold the cloth in
the international market. London in fact came to be known as a
finishing centre.
This proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of
commercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods
were produced by a vast number of producers working within
their family farms, not in factories. At each stage of production 20
to 25 workers were employed by each merchant. This meant that
each clothier was controlling hundreds of workers.
1.1 The Coming Up of the Factory
The earliest factories in England came up by the 1730s. But it
was only in the late eighteenth century that the number of
factories multiplied.
The first symbol of the new era was cotton. Its production boomed
in the late nineteenth century. In 1760 Britain was importing 2.5
million pounds of raw cotton to feed its cotton industry. By 1787
this import soared to 22 million pounds. This increase was linked to
a number of changes within the process of production. Let us look
briefly at some of these.
A series of inventions in the eighteenth century increased the efficacy
of each step of the production process (carding, twisting and
spinning, and rolling). They enhanced the output per worker, enabling
each worker to produce more, and they made possible the
production of stronger threads and yarn. Then Richard Arkwright
created the cotton mill. Till this time, as you have seen, cloth
production was spread all over the countryside and carried out within
village households. But now, the costly new machines could be
purchased, set up and maintained in the mill. Within the mill all the

processes were brought together under one roof and management.
This allowed a more careful supervision over the production process,
a watch over quality, and the regulation of labour, all of which had
been difficult to do when production was in the countryside.
In the early nineteenth century, factories increasingly became an
intimate part of the English landscape. So visible were the imposing
new mills, so magical seemed to be the power of new technology,
that contemporaries were dazzled. They concentrated their attention
on the mills, almost forgetting the bylanes and the workshops where
production still continued.
The way in which historians focus on
industrialisation rather than on small
workshops is a good example of how what we
believe today about the past is influenced by
what historians choose to notice and what they
ignore. Note down one event or aspect of your
own life which adults such as your parents or
teachers may think is unimportant, but which
you believe to be important.

1.2 The Pace of Industrial Change
How rapid was the process of industrialisation? Does industrialisation
mean only the growth of factory industries?
First: The most dynamic industries in Britain were clearly cotton and
metals. Growing at a rapid pace, cotton was the leading sector in the
first phase of industrialisation up to the 1840s. After that the iron
and steel industry led the way. With the expansion of railways, in
England from the 1840s and in the colonies from the 1860s, the
demand for iron and steel increased rapidly. By 1873 Britain was
exporting iron and steel worth about £ 77 million, double the value
of its cotton export.

difference in the way the two images show

Second: the new industries could not easily displace traditional
industries. Even at the end of the nineteenth century, less than 20 per
cent of the total workforce was employed in technologically
advanced industrial sectors. Textiles was a dynamic sector, but a
large portion of the output was produced not within factories, but
outside, within domestic units.
Third: the pace of change in the ‘traditional’ industries was not set
by steam-powered cotton or metal industries, but they did not remain
entirely stagnant either. Seemingly ordinary and small innovations
were the basis of growth in many non-mechanised sectors such as
food processing, building, pottery, glass work, tanning, furniture
making, and production of implements.
Fourth: technological changes occurred slowly. They did not spread
dramatically across the industrial landscape. New technology was
expensive and merchants and industrialists were cautious about using
it. The machines often broke down and repair was costly. They
were not as effective as their inventors and manufacturers claimed.
Consider the case of the steam engine. James Watt improved the
steam engine produced by Newcomen and patented the new engine
in 1781. His industrialist friend Mathew Boulton manufactured the
new model. But for years he could find no buyers. At the beginning
of the nineteenth century, there were no more than 321 steam engines
all over England. Of these, 80 were
in cotton industries, nine in wool
industries, and the rest in mining,
canal works and iron works. Steam
engines were not used in any of the
other industries till much later in
the century. So even the most
powerful new technology that
enhanced the productivity of
labour manifold was slow to be
accepted by industrialists.
Historians now have come to
increasingly recognise that the typical
worker in the mid-nineteenth century
was not a machine operator but the
traditional craftsperson and labourer.

The  Age  of  Industrialisation
2  Hand Labour and Steam Power
In Victorian Britain there was no shortage of human labour. Poor
peasants and vagrants moved to the cities in large numbers in search
of jobs, waiting for work. As you will know, when there is plenty of
labour, wages are low. So industrialists had no problem of labour
shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines
that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.
In many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works
and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So
they needed more workers to meet their peak demand.  Book-
binders and printers, catering to Christmas demand, too needed
extra hands before December. At the waterfront, winter was the
time that ships were repaired and spruced up. In all such industries
where production fluctuated with the season, industrialists usually
preferred hand labour, employing workers for the season.
Will Thorne is one of those who went in search
of seasonal work, loading bricks and doing odd
jobs. He describes how job-seekers walked to
London in search of work:
‘I had always wanted to go to London, and my
desire … was stimulated by letters from an old
workmate … who was now working at the Old
Kent Road Gas Works … I finally decided to go …
in November, 1881. With two friends I started
out to walk the journey, filled with the hope
that we would be able to obtain employment,
when we get there, with the kind assistance of
my friend … we had little money when we
started, not enough to pay for our food and
lodgings each night until we arrived in London.
Some days we walked as much as twenty miles,
and other days less. Our money was gone at
the end of the third day … For two nights we
slept out – once under a haystack, and once in
an old farm shed … On arrival in London we tried
to find … my friend … but … were unsuccessful.
Our money was gone, so there was nothing for
us to do but to walk around until late at night,
and then try to find some place to sleep. We
found an old building and slept in it that night.
The next day, Sunday, late in the afternoon, we
got to the Old Kent Gas Works, and applied for
work. To my great surprise, the man we had
been looking for was working at the time. He
spoke to the foreman and I was given a job.’

hammers were produced and 45 kinds of axes. These required
human skill, not mechanical technology.
In Victorian Britain, the upper classes – the aristocrats and the
bourgeoisie – preferred things produced by hand. Handmade
products came to symbolise refinement and class. They were better
finished, individually produced, and carefully designed. Machine-
made goods were for export to the colonies.
In countries with labour shortage, industrialists were keen on using
mechanical power so that the need for human labour can be
minimised. This was the case in nineteenth-century America. Britain,
however, had no problem hiring human hands.
2.1 Life of the Workers
The abundance of labour in the market affected the lives of workers.
As news of possible jobs travelled to the countryside, hundreds
tramped to the cities. The actual possibility of getting a job depended
on existing networks of friendship and kin relations. If you had
a relative or a friend in a factory, you were more likely to get a
job quickly. But not everyone had social connections. Many job-
seekers had to wait weeks, spending nights under bridges or in night

examination to see whether they were carrying disease, their bodies were cleansed, and their clothes purified. They
had to also do hard labour.

shelters. Some stayed in Night Refuges that were set up by private
individuals; others went to the Casual Wards maintained by the Poor
Law authorities.
Seasonality of work in many industries meant prolonged periods
without work. After the busy season was over, the poor were on
the streets again. Some returned to the countryside after the winter,
when the demand for labour in the rural areas opened up in places.
But most looked for odd jobs, which till the mid-nineteenth century
were difficult to find.
Wages increased somewhat in the early nineteenth century. But they
tell us little about the welfare of the workers. The average figures
hide the variations between trades and the fluctuations from year to
year. For instance, when prices rose sharply during the prolonged
Napoleonic War, the real value of what the workers earned fell
significantly, since the same wages could now buy fewer things.
Moreover, the income of workers depended not on the wage rate
alone. What was also critical was the period of employment: the
number of days of work determined the average daily income of
the workers. At the best of times till the mid-nineteenth century,
about 10 per cent of the urban population were extremely poor. In
periods of economic slump, like the 1830s, the proportion of
unemployed went up to anything between 35 and 75 per cent in
different regions.
The fear of unemployment made workers hostile to the introduction
of new technology. When the Spinning Jenny was introduced in
A magistrate reported in 1790 about an incident when he was
called in to protect a manufacturer’s property from being attacked
by workers:
‘From the depredations of a lawless Banditti of colliers and their
wives, for the wives had lost their work to spinning engines … they
advanced at first with much insolence, avowing their intention of
cutting to pieces the machine lately introduced in the woollen
manufacture; which they suppose, if generally adopted, will lessen
the demand for manual labour. The women became clamorous.
The men were more open to conviction and after some
expostulation were induced to desist from their purpose and return
peaceably home.’

3  Industrialisation in the Colonies
Let us now move to India to see how a colony industrialises. Once
again we will look not only at factory industries but also at the
non-mechanised sector. We will limit our discussion primarily to
textile industries.
3.1 The Age of Indian Textiles
Before the age of machine industries, silk and cotton goods from
India dominated the international market in textiles. Coarser cottons
were produced in many countries, but the finer varieties often came
from India. Armenian and Persian merchants took the goods from
Punjab to Afghanistan, eastern Persia and Central Asia.  Bales of fine
textiles were carried on camel back via the north-west frontier, through
mountain passes and across deserts. A vibrant sea trade operated
through the main pre-colonial ports. Surat on the Gujarat coast
connected India to the Gulf and Red Sea Ports; Masulipatam on
the Coromandel coast  and Hoogly in Bengal had trade links with
Southeast Asian ports.
A variety of Indian merchants and bankers were involved in this
network of export trade – financing production, carrying goods
and supplying exporters. Supply merchants linked the port towns to
the inland regions. They gave advances to weavers, procured the
woven cloth from weaving villages, and carried the supply to the
ports. At the port, the big shippers and export merchants had brokers
who negotiated the price and bought goods from the supply
merchants operating inland.
By the 1750s this network, controlled by Indian merchants, was
breaking down.
The European companies gradually gained power – first securing a
variety of concessions from local courts, then the monopoly rights
to trade. This resulted in a decline of the old ports of Surat and
Hoogly through which local merchants had operated. Exports from
these ports fell dramatically, the credit that had financed the earlier
trade began drying up, and the local bankers slowly went bankrupt.
In the last years of the seventeenth century, the gross value of trade
that passed through Surat had been Rs 16 million. By the 1740s it
had slumped to Rs 3 million.

land links of the textile trade from India to

While Surat and Hoogly decayed, Bombay and Calcutta grew. This
shift from the old ports to the new ones was an indicator of the
growth of colonial power. Trade through the new ports came to
be controlled by European companies, and was carried in European
ships. While many of the old trading houses collapsed, those that
wanted to survive had to now operate within a network shaped by
European trading companies.
How did these changes affect the life of weavers and other artisans?
3.2 What Happened to Weavers?
The consolidation of East India Company power after the 1760s
did not initially lead to a decline in textile exports from India. British
cotton industries had not yet expanded and Indian fine textiles were
in great demand in Europe. So the company was keen on expanding
textile exports from India.
Before establishing political power in Bengal and Carnatic in the
1760s and 1770s, the East India Company had found it difficult to
ensure a regular supply of goods for export. The French, Dutch,

Portuguese as well as the local traders competed in the market
to secure woven cloth. So the weaver and supply merchants
could bargain and try selling the produce to the best buyer. In
their letters back to London, Company officials continuously
complained of difficulties of supply and the high prices.
However, once the East India Company established political
power, it could assert a monopoly right to trade. It proceeded
to develop a system of management and control that would
eliminate competition, control costs, and ensure regular supplies
of cotton and silk goods. This it did through a series of steps.
First: the Company tried to eliminate the existing traders and
brokers connected with the cloth trade, and establish a more
direct control over the weaver. It appointed a paid servant called
the gomastha to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine
the quality of cloth.
Second: it prevented Company weavers from dealing with other
buyers. One way of doing this was through the system of advances.
Once an order was placed, the weavers were given loans to purchase
the raw material for their production. Those who took loans had to
hand over the cloth they produced to the gomastha. They could not
take it to any other trader.
As loans flowed in and the demand for fine textiles expanded,
weavers eagerly took the advances, hoping to earn more. Many
weavers had small plots of land which they had earlier cultivated
along with weaving, and the produce from this took care of their
family needs. Now they had to lease out the land and devote all their
time to weaving. Weaving, in fact, required the labour of the entire
family, with children and women all engaged in different stages of
the process.
Soon, however, in many weaving villages there were reports of
clashes between weavers and gomasthas. Earlier supply merchants had
very often lived within the weaving  villages, and had a close
relationship with the weavers, looking after their needs and helping
them in times of crisis. The new gomasthas were outsiders, with no
long-term social link with the village. They acted arrogantly, marched
into villages with sepoys and peons, and punished weavers for delays
in supply – often beating and flogging them. The weavers lost the
space to bargain for prices and sell to different buyers: the price they
received from the Company was miserably low and the loans they
had accepted tied them to the Company.

In many places in Carnatic and Bengal, weavers deserted villages
and migrated, setting up looms in other villages where they had
some family relation. Elsewhere, weavers along with the village
traders revolted, opposing the Company and its officials. Over time
many weavers began refusing loans, closing down their workshops
and taking to agricultural labour.
By the turn of the nineteenth century, cotton weavers faced a
new set of problems.
3.3 Manchester Comes to India
In 1772, Henry Patullo, a Company official, had ventured to
say that the demand for Indian textiles could never reduce, since
no other nation produced goods of the same quality. Yet by
the beginning of the nineteenth century we see the beginning of
a long decline of textile exports from India. In 1811-12
piece-goods accounted for 33 per cent of India’s exports; by
1850-51 it was no more than 3 per cent.
Why did this happen? What were its implications?
As cotton industries developed in England, industrial groups began
worrying about imports from other countries. They pressurised
the government to impose import duties on cotton textiles so that
Manchester goods could sell in Britain without facing any
competition from outside. At the same time industrialists persuaded
the East India Company  to sell British manufactures in Indian
markets as well. Exports of British cotton goods increased
dramatically in the early nineteenth century.  At the end of the
eighteenth century there had been virtually no import of cotton
piece-goods into India.  But by 1850 cotton piece-goods constituted
over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s
this figure  was over 50 per cent.
Cotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time:
their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being
glutted with Manchester imports. Produced by machines at lower
costs, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could
not easily compete with them. By the 1850s, reports from most
weaving regions of India narrated stories of decline and desolation.
By the 1860s, weavers faced a new problem. They could not get
sufficient supply of raw cotton of good quality. When the American
The Commissioner of Patna wrote:
‘It appears that twenty yeas ago, a brisk trade
was carried on in the manufacture of cloth at
Jahanabad, and Behar, which has in the former
place entirely ceased, while in the latter the
amount of manufacture is very limited, in
consequence of the cheap and durable goods
from Manchester with which the Native
manufactures are unable to compete.’

The  Age  of  Industrialisation
Civil War broke out and cotton supplies from the US were cut
off, Britain turned to India. As raw cotton exports from India
increased, the price of raw cotton shot up. Weavers in India
were starved of supplies and forced to buy raw cotton at
exorbitant prices. In this, situation weaving could not pay.
Then, by the end of the nineteenth century, weavers and other
craftspeople faced yet another problem. Factories in India began
production, flooding the market with machine-goods. How could
weaving industries possibly survive?

4  Factories Come Up
The first cotton mill in Bombay came up in 1854 and it went into
production two years later. By 1862 four mills were at work with
94,000 spindles and 2,150 looms. Around the same time jute mills
came up in Bengal, the first being set up in 1855 and another one
seven years later, in 1862. In north India, the Elgin Mill was started
in Kanpur in the 1860s, and a year later the first cotton mill of
Ahmedabad was set up. By 1874, the first spinning and weaving
mill of Madras began production.
Who set up the industries? Where did the capital come from? Who
came to work in the mills?
4.1 The Early Entrepreneurs
Industries were set up in different regions by varying sorts of people.
Let us see who they were.
The history of many business groups goes back to trade with China.
From the late eighteenth century, as you have read in your book last
year, the British in India began exporting opium to China and took
tea from China to England. Many Indians became junior players in
this trade, providing finance, procuring supplies, and shipping
consignments. Having earned through trade, some of these
businessmen had visions of developing industrial enterprises in India.
In Bengal, Dwarkanath Tagore made his fortune in the China trade
before he turned to industrial investment, setting up six joint-stock
companies in the 1830s and 1840s.  Tagore’s enterprises sank along
with those of others in the wider business crises of the 1840s, but
later in the nineteenth century many of the China traders became
successful industrialists. In Bombay, Parsis like Dinshaw Petit and
Jamsetjee Nusserwanjee Tata who built huge industrial empires in
India, accumulated their initial wealth partly from exports to China,
and partly from raw cotton shipments to England. Seth Hukumchand,
a Marwari businessman who set up the first Indian jute mill in
Calcutta in 1917, also traded with China. So did the father as well as
grandfather of the famous industrialist G.D. Birla.
Capital was accumulated through other trade networks. Some
merchants from Madras traded with Burma while others had links
with the Middle East and East Africa. There were yet other
Fig. 17 – Dwarkanath Tagore.
Dwarkanath Tagore believed that India would
develop through westernisation and
industrialisation. He invested in shipping,
shipbuilding, mining, banking, plantations
and insurance.

Jeejeebhoy was the son of a Parsi weaver. Like
many others of his time, he was involved in
the China trade and shipping. He owned a
large fleet of ships, but competition from
English and American shippers forced him to
sell his ships by the 1850s.

commercial groups, but they were not directly involved in external
trade. They operated within India, carrying goods from one place
to another, banking money, transferring funds between cities, and
financing traders. When opportunities of investment in industries
opened up, many of them set up factories.
As colonial control over Indian trade tightened,  the space within
which Indian merchants could function became increasingly limited.
They were barred from trading with Europe in manufactured goods,
and had to export mostly raw materials and food grains – raw
cotton, opium, wheat and indigo – required by the British. They
were also gradually edged out of the shipping business.
Till the First World War, European Managing Agencies in fact
controlled a large sector of Indian industries. Three of the biggest
ones were Bird Heiglers & Co., Andrew Yule, and Jardine Skinner
& Co. These Agencies mobilised capital, set up joint-stock companies
and managed them. In most instances Indian financiers provided
the capital while the European Agencies made all investment and
business decisions. The European merchant-industrialists had their
own chambers of commerce which Indian businessmen were not
allowed to join.
4.2 Where Did the Workers Come From?
Factories needed workers. With the expansion of factories, this
demand increased. In 1901, there were 584,000 workers in Indian
factories. By 1946 the number was over 2,436, 000. Where did the
workers come from?
 In most industrial regions workers came from the districts around.
Peasants and artisans who found no work in the village went to the
industrial centres in search of work. Over 50 per cent workers in the
Bombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring
district of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their
textile hands from the villages within the district of Kanpur. Most
often millworkers moved between the village and the city, returning
to their village homes during harvests and festivals.
Over time, as news of employment spread, workers travelled great
distances in the hope of work in the mills. From the United Provinces,
for instance, they went to work in the textile mills of Bombay and in
the jute mills of Calcutta.

In 1912, J.N. Tata set up the first iron and steel
works in India at Jamshedpur. Iron and steel
industries in India started much later than
textiles. In colonial India industrial machinery,
railways and locomotives were mostly imported.
So capital goods industries could not really
develop in any significant way till Independence.

Getting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and
the demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were
always more than the jobs available.  Entry into the mills was also
restricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits.
Very often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people
from his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city
and provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore
became a person with some authority and power. He began
demanding money and gifts for his favour and controlling the lives
of workers.
The number of factory workers increased over time. However,
as you will see, they were a small proportion of the total
industrial workforce.
Vasant Parkar, who was once a millworker in Bombay, said:
‘The workers would pay the jobbers money to get their sons work
in the mill … The mill worker was closely associated with his village,
physically and emotionally. He would go home to cut the harvest
and for sowing. The Konkani would go home to cut the paddy
and the Ghati, the sugarcane. It was an accepted practice for
which the mills granted leave.’

5  The Peculiarities of Industrial Growth
European Managing Agencies, which dominated industrial
production in India, were interested in certain kinds of products.
They established tea and coffee plantations, acquiring land at cheap
rates from the colonial government; and they invested in mining,
indigo and jute. Most of these were products required primarily for
export trade and not for sale in India.
When Indian businessmen began setting up industries in the late
nineteenth century, they avoided competing with Manchester goods
in the Indian market. Since yarn was not an important part of British
imports into India, the early cotton mills in India produced coarse
cotton yarn (thread) rather than fabric. When yarn was imported it
was only of the superior variety. The yarn produced in Indian spinning
mills was used by handloom weavers in India or exported to China.
By the first decade of the twentieth century a series of changes
affected the pattern of industrialisation. As the swadeshi movement
gathered momentum, nationalists mobilised people to boycott foreign
cloth. Industrial groups organised themselves to protect their collective
interests, pressurising the government to increase tariff protection
and grant other concessions. From 1906, moreover, the export of
Indian yarn to China declined since produce from Chinese and
Japanese mills flooded the Chinese market.
So industrialists in India began shifting from
yarn to cloth production.  Cotton piece-
goods production in India doubled between
1900 and 1912.
Yet, till the First World War, industrial growth
was slow. The war created a dramatically
new situation. With British mills busy with
war production to meet the needs of the
army, Manchester imports into India
declined. Suddenly, Indian mills had a vast
home market to supply. As the war
prolonged, Indian factories were called
upon to supply war needs: jute bags, cloth
for army uniforms, tents and leather boots,
horse and mule saddles and a host of other
items. New factories were set up and old

ones ran multiple shifts. Many new workers were employed and
everyone was made to work longer hours. Over the war years
industrial production boomed.
After the war, Manchester could never recapture its old position in
the Indian market. Unable to modernise and compete with the  US,
Germany and Japan, the economy of Britain crumbled after the
war. Cotton production collapsed and exports of cotton cloth from
Britain fell dramatically. Within the colonies, local industrialists
gradually consolidated their position, substituting foreign
manufactures and capturing the home market.
5.1 Small-scale Industries Predominate
While factory industries grew steadily after the war, large industries
formed only a small segment of the economy.  Most of them –
about 67 per cent in 1911 – were located in Bengal and Bombay.
Over the rest of the country, small-scale production continued to
predominate. Only a small proportion of the total industrial labour
force worked in registered factories: 5 per cent in 1911 and 10 per
cent in 1931. The rest worked in small workshops and household
units, often located in alleys and bylanes, invisible to the passer-by.
In fact, in some instances, handicrafts production actually expanded
in the twentieth century. This is true even in the case of the handloom
sector that we have discussed. While cheap machine-made thread
wiped out the spinning industry in the nineteenth century, the weavers
survived, despite problems. In the twentieth century, handloom
cloth production expanded steadily: almost trebling between 1900
and 1940.
How did this happen?
This was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people
adopt new technology if that helps them improve production
without excessively pushing up costs. So, by the second decade of
the twentieth century we find weavers using looms with a fly shuttle.
This increased productivity per worker, speeded up production and
reduced labour demand. By 1941, over 35 per cent of handlooms
in India were fitted with fly shuttles: in regions like Travancore,
Madras, Mysore, Cochin, Bengal the proportion was 70 to 80 per
cent. There were several other small innovations that helped weavers
improve their productivity and compete with the mill sector.

into the verticle threads (called the warp). The
invention of the fly shuttle made it possible
for weavers to operate large looms and weave
wide pieces of cloth.

The  Age  of  Industrialisation
Certain groups of weavers were in a better position than others to
survive the competition with mill industries. Amongst weavers some
produced coarse cloth while others wove finer varieties. The coarser
cloth was bought by the poor and its demand fluctuated violently.
In times of bad harvests and famines, when the rural poor had little
to eat, and their cash income disappeared, they could not possibly
buy cloth. The demand for the finer varieties bought by the
well-to-do was more stable. The rich could buy these even when the
poor starved. Famines did not affect the sale of Banarasi or
Baluchari saris. Moreover, as you have seen, mills could not imitate
specialised weaves. Saris with woven borders, or the famous lungis
and handkerchiefs of Madras, could not be easily displaced by
mill production.
Weavers and other craftspeople who continued to expand
production through the twentieth century, did not necessarily prosper.
They lived hard lives and worked long hours. Very often the entire
household – including all the women and children – had to work at
various stages of the production process. But they were not simply
remnants of past times in the age of factories. Their life and labour
was integral to the process of industrialisation.

6  Market for Goods
We have seen how British manufacturers attempted to take over
the Indian market, and how Indian weavers and craftsmen, traders
and industrialists resisted colonial controls, demanded tariff
protection, created their own spaces, and tried to extend the market
for their produce.
But when new products are produced people have to be
persuaded to buy them. They have to feel like using the product.
How was this done?
One way in which new consumers are created is through
advertisements. As you know, advertisements make products appear
desirable and necessary. They try to shape the minds of people and
create new needs. Today we live in a world where advertisements
surround us. They appear in newspapers, magazines, hoardings, street
walls, television screens. But if we look back into history we find
that from the very beginning of the industrial age, advertisements
have played a part in expanding the markets for products, and in
shaping a new consumer culture.
When Manchester industrialists began selling cloth in India, they put
labels on the cloth bundles. The label was needed to make the place
of manufacture and the name of the company familiar to the buyer.
The label was also to be a mark of quality. When buyers saw ‘MADE
IN MANCHESTER’ written in bold on the label, they were
expected to feel confident about buying the cloth.

twentieth century.

The  Age  of  Industrialisation
But labels did not only carry words and texts. They also carried
images and were very often beautifully illustrated. If we look
at these old labels, we can have some idea of the mind of the
manufacturers, their calculations, and the way they appealed to
the people.
Images of Indian gods and goddesses regularly appeared on these
labels. It was as if the association with gods gave divine approval to
the goods being sold. The imprinted image of Krishna or Saraswati
was also intended to make the manufacture from a foreign land
appear somewhat familiar to Indian people.
By the late nineteenth century, manufacturers were printing calendars
to popularise their products. Unlike newspapers and magazines,
calendars were used even by people who could not read. They were
hung in tea shops and in poor people’s homes just as much as in
offices and middle-class apartments. And those who hung the
calendars had to see the advertisements, day after day, through the
year. In these calendars, once again, we see the figures of gods being
used to sell new products.
Like the images of gods, figures of important personages, of
emperors and nawabs, adorned advertisement and calendars. The
message very often seemed to say: if you respect the royal figure,
then respect this product; when the product was being used by
kings, or produced under royal command, its quality could not
be questioned.
When Indian manufacturers advertised the nationalist message was
clear and loud. If you care for the nation then buy products that
Indians produce. Advertisements became a vehicle of the nationalist
message of swadeshi.
Conclusion
Clearly, the age of industries has meant major technological changes,
growth of factories, and the making of a new industrial labour
force. However, as you have seen, hand technology and small-scale
production remained an important part of the industrial landscape.

newspapers,  prints of famous paintings, and also in everyday things
like theatre programmes, official circulars, calendars, diaries,
advertisements, cinema posters at street corners. We read printed
literature, see printed images, follow the news through newspapers,
and track public debates that appear in print. We take for granted
this world of print and often forget that there was a time before
print. We may not realise that print itself has a history which has, in
fact, shaped our contemporary world. What is this history? When
did printed literature begin to circulate? How has it helped create
the modern world?
In this chapter we will look at the development of print, from its
beginnings in East Asia to its expansion in Europe and in India. We
will understand the impact of the spread of technology and consider
how social lives and cultures changed with the coming of print.

1  The First Printed Books
Fig. 2 a – A page from the Diamond Sutra.
The earliest kind of print technology was developed in China, Japan
and Korea. This was a system of hand printing. From AD 594
onwards, books in China were printed by rubbing paper – also
invented there – against the inked surface of woodblocks. As both
sides of the thin, porous sheet could not be printed, the traditional
Chinese ‘accordion book’ was folded and stitched at the side.
Superbly skilled craftsmen could duplicate, with remarkable accuracy,
the beauty of calligraphy.
The imperial state in China was, for a very long time, the major
producer of printed material. China possessed a huge bureaucratic
system which recruited its personnel through civil service
examinations. Textbooks for this examination were printed in vast
numbers under the sponsorship of the imperial state.  From the
sixteenth century, the number of examination candidates went up
and that increased the volume of print.
By the seventeenth century, as urban culture bloomed in China, the
uses of print diversified. Print was no longer used just by scholar-
officials. Merchants used print in their everyday life, as they collected
trade information. Reading increasingly became a leisure activity.
The new readership preferred fictional narratives, poetry,
autobiographies, anthologies of literary masterpieces, and romantic
plays. Rich women began to read, and many women began
publishing their poetry and plays. Wives of scholar-officials published
their works and courtesans wrote about their lives.
This new reading culture was accompanied by a new technology.
Western printing techniques and mechanical presses were imported
in the late nineteenth century as Western powers established their
outposts in China. Shanghai became the hub of the new print culture,
catering to the Western-style schools. From hand printing there was
now a gradual shift to mechanical printing.
1.1 Print in Japan
Buddhist missionaries from China introduced hand-printing
technology into Japan around AD 768-770. The oldest Japanese book,
printed in AD 868, is the Buddhist Diamond Sutra, containing six sheets
of text and woodcut illustrations. Pictures were printed on textiles,

playing cards and paper money. In
medieval Japan, poets and prose
writers were regularly published,
and books were cheap and abundant.
Printing of visual material led to
interesting publishing practices. In
the late eighteenth century, in the
flourishing urban circles at Edo
(later to be known as Tokyo),
illustrated collections of paintings
depicted an elegant urban culture, involving artists, courtesans,
and teahouse gatherings. Libraries and bookstores were packed
with hand-printed material of various types – books on women,
musical instruments, calculations, tea ceremony, flower
arrangements, proper etiquette, cooking and famous places.
Box 1
Kitagawa Utamaro, born in Edo in 1753, was widely known for
his contributions to an art form called ukiyo (‘pictures of the floating
world’) or depiction of ordinary human experiences, especially urban
ones. These prints travelled to contemporary US and Europe and
influenced artists like Manet, Monet and Van Gogh. Publishers like
Tsutaya Juzaburo identified subjects and commissioned artists who
drew the theme in outline. Then a skilled woodblock carver pasted
the drawing on a woodblock and carved a printing block to
reproduce the painter’s lines. In the process, the original drawing
would be destroyed and only prints would survive.

2  Print Comes to Europe
For centuries, silk and spices from China flowed into Europe through
the silk route. In the eleventh century, Chinese paper reached Europe
via the same route. Paper made possible the production of
manuscripts, carefully written by scribes. Then, in 1295, Marco Polo,
a great explorer, returned to Italy after many years of exploration in
China. As you read above, China already had the technology of
woodblock printing. Marco Polo brought this knowledge back with
him. Now Italians began producing books with woodblocks, and
soon the technology spread to other parts of Europe. Luxury
editions were still handwritten on very expensive vellum, meant for
aristocratic circles and rich monastic libraries which scoffed at printed
books as cheap vulgarities. Merchants and students in the university
towns bought the cheaper printed copies.
As the demand for books increased, booksellers all over Europe
began exporting books to many different countries. Book fairs were
held at different places. Production of handwritten manuscripts was
also organised in new ways to meet the expanded demand. Scribes
or skilled handwriters were no longer solely employed by wealthy
or influential patrons but increasingly by booksellers as well. More
than 50 scribes often worked for one bookseller.
But the production of handwritten manuscripts could not satisfy
the ever-increasing demand for books. Copying was an expensive,
laborious and time-consuming business. Manuscripts were fragile,
awkward to handle, and could not be carried around or read easily.
Their circulation therefore remained limited.  With the growing
demand for books, woodblock printing gradually became more
and more popular. By the early fifteenth century, woodblocks were
being widely used in Europe to print textiles, playing cards, and
religious pictures with simple, brief texts.
There was clearly a great need for even quicker and cheaper
reproduction of texts. This could only be with the invention of a
new print technology. The breakthrough occurred at Strasbourg,
Germany, where Johann Gutenberg developed the first-known
printing press in the 1430s.

2.1 Gutenberg and the Printing Press
Gutenberg was the son of a merchant and grew up on a large
agricultural estate. From his childhood he had seen wine and olive
presses. Subsequently, he learnt the art of polishing stones, became a
master goldsmith, and also acquired the expertise to create lead
moulds used for making trinkets. Drawing on this knowledge,
Gutenberg adapted existing technology to design his innovation.
The olive press provided the model for the printing press, and moulds
were used for casting the metal types for the letters of the alphabet.
By 1448, Gutenberg perfected the system. The first book he printed
was the Bible. About 180 copies were printed and it took three
years to produce them. By the standards of the time this was fast
production.
The new technology did not entirely displace the existing art of
producing books by hand.
In fact, printed books at first closely resembled the written
manuscripts in appearance and layout. The metal letters imitated the
ornamental handwritten styles. Borders were illuminated by hand
with foliage and other patterns, and illustrations were painted. In the
books printed for the rich, space for decoration was kept blank on
the printed page. Each purchaser could choose the design and decide
on the painting school that would do the illustrations.
In the hundred years between 1450 and 1550, printing presses were
set up in most countries of Europe.  Printers from Germany travelled
to other countries, seeking work and helping start new presses. As
the number of printing presses grew, book production boomed.
The second half of the fifteenth century saw 20 million copies of
printed books flooding the markets in Europe. The number went
up in the sixteenth century to about 200 million copies.
This shift from hand printing to mechanical printing led to the
print revolution.

Notice the long handle attached to the screw.
This handle was used to turn the screw and
press down the platen over the printing block
that was placed on top of a sheet of damp
paper. Gutenberg developed metal types for
each of the 26 characters of the Roman
alphabet and devised a way of moving them
around so as to compose different words of the
text. This came to be known as the moveable
type printing machine, and it remained the basic
print technology over the next 300 years.
Books could now be produced much faster than
was possible when each print block was
prepared by carving a piece of wood by hand.
The Gutenberg  press could print 250 sheets
on one side per hour.

Gutenberg printed about 180 copies, of which no more than 50 have
survived.
Look at these pages of Gutenberg’s Bible carefully. They were not just
products of new technology. The text was printed in the new Gutenberg
press with metal type, but the borders were carefully designed, painted and
illuminated by hand by artists. No two copies were the same. Every page of
each copy was different. Even when two copies look similar, a careful
comparison will reveal differences. Elites everywhere preferred this lack of
uniformity: what they possessed then could be claimed as unique, for no
one else owned a copy that was exactly the same.
In the text you will notice the use of colour within the letters in various
places. This had two functions: it added colour to the page, and highlighted
all the holy words to emphasise their significance. But the colour on every
page of the text was added by hand. Gutenberg printed the text in black,
leaving spaces where the colour could be filled in later.

3  The Print Revolution and Its Impact
What was the print revolution? It was not just a development, a new
way of producing books; it  transformed the lives of people,
changing their relationship to information and knowledge, and with
institutions and authorities. It influenced popular perceptions and
opened up new ways of looking at things.
Let us explore some of these changes.
3.1 A New Reading Public
With the printing press, a new reading public emerged. Printing
reduced the cost of books. The time and labour required to produce
each book came down, and multiple copies could be produced
with greater ease. Books flooded the market, reaching out to an
ever-growing readership.
Access to books created a new culture of reading. Earlier, reading
was restricted to the elites. Common people lived in a world of oral
culture. They heard sacred texts read out, ballads recited, and folk
tales narrated. Knowledge was transferred orally. People collectively
heard a story, or saw a performance. As you will see in Chapter 8,
they did not read a book individually and silently. Before the age of
print, books were not only expensive but they could not be produced
in sufficient numbers. Now books could reach out to wider sections
of people. If earlier there was a hearing public, now a reading public
came into being.
But the transition was not so simple. Books could be read only by
the literate, and the rates of literacy in most European countries
were very low till the twentieth century. How, then, could publishers
persuade the common people to welcome the printed book? To do
this, they had to keep in mind the wider reach of the printed work:
even those who did not read could certainly enjoy listening to books
being read out. So printers began publishing popular ballads and
folk tales, and such books would be profusely illustrated with pictures.
These were then sung and recited at gatherings in villages and in
taverns in towns.
Oral culture thus entered print and printed material was orally
transmitted. The line that separated the oral and reading cultures
became blurred. And the hearing public and reading public became
intermingled.
New words
Ballad – A historical account or folk tale in
verse, usually sung or recited
Taverns – Places where people gathered to
drink alcohol, to be served food, and to meet

3.2 Religious Debates and the Fear of Print
Print created the possibility of wide circulation of
ideas, and introduced a new world of debate and
discussion. Even those who disagreed with
established authorities could now print and circulate
their ideas. Through the printed message, they could
persuade people to think differently, and move them
to action. This had significance in different spheres
of life.
Not everyone welcomed the printed book, and those
who did also had fears about it. Many were
apprehensive of the effects that the easier access to
the printed word and the wider circulation of books,
could have on people’s minds. It was feared that if
there was no control over what was printed and
read then rebellious and irreligious thoughts might
spread. If that happened the authority of ‘valuable’
literature would be destroyed. Expressed by religious
authorities and monarchs, as well as many writers
and artists, this anxiety was the basis of widespread
criticism of the new printed literature that had begun
to circulate.
Let us consider the implication of this in one sphere
of life in early modern Europe – namely,  religion.
In 1517, the religious reformer Martin Luther wrote
Ninety Five Theses criticising many of the practices
and rituals of the Roman Catholic Church.  A printed
copy of this was posted on a church door in Wittenberg. It challenged
the Church to debate his ideas.  Luther’s writings were immediately
reproduced in vast numbers and read widely. This lead to a division
within the Church and to the beginning of the Protestant
Reformation. Luther’s translation of the New Testament sold 5,000
copies within a few weeks and a second edition appeared within
three months. Deeply grateful to print, Luther said, ‘Printing is the
ultimate gift of God and the greatest one.’ Several scholars, in fact,
think that print brought about a new intellectual atmosphere and
helped spread the new ideas that led to the Reformation.

3.3 Print and Dissent
Print and popular religious literature stimulated many distinctive
individual interpretations of faith even among little-educated working
people. In the sixteenth century, Menocchio, a miller in Italy, began
to read books that were available in his locality. He reinterpreted the
message of the Bible and formulated a view of God and Creation
that enraged the Roman Catholic Church. When the Roman Church
began its inquisition to repress heretical ideas, Menocchio was hauled
up twice and ultimately executed. The Roman Church, troubled by
such effects of popular readings and questionings of faith, imposed
severe controls over publishers and booksellers and began to maintain
an Index of Prohibited Books from 1558.

Heretical – Beliefs which do not follow the
accepted teachings of the Church. In medieval
times, heresy was seen as a threat to the right

were severely punished
Satiety – The state of being fulfilled much
beyond the point of satisfaction
Seditious – Action, speech or writing that is
seen as opposing  the government
Fear of the book
Erasmus, a Latin scholar and a Catholic reformer,
who criticised the excesses of Catholicism but kept
his distance from Luther, expressed a deep anxiety
about printing. He wrote in Adages (1508):
‘To what corner of the world do they not fly,
these swarms of new books? It may be that one
here and there contributes something worth
knowing, but the very multitude of them is hurtful
to scholarship, because it creates a glut, and even
in good things satiety is most harmful ... [printers]
fill the world with books, not just trifling things
(such as I write, perhaps), but stupid, ignorant,

seditious books, and the number of them
is such that even the valuable publications lose

4  The Reading Mania
Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries literacy rates went
up in most parts of Europe. Churches of different denominations
set up schools in villages, carrying literacy to peasants and artisans.
By the end of the eighteenth century, in some parts of Europe
literacy rates were as high as 60 to 80 per cent. As literacy and schools
spread in European countries, there was a virtual reading mania.
People wanted books to read and printers produced books in ever-
increasing numbers.
New forms of popular literature appeared in print, targeting new
audiences. Booksellers employed pedlars who roamed around
villages, carrying little books for sale. There were almanacs or ritual
calendars, along with ballads and folktales. But other forms of reading
matter, largely for entertainment, began to reach ordinary readers as
well. In England, penny chapbooks were carried by petty pedlars
known as chapmen, and sold for a penny, so that even the poor
could buy them. In France, were the “Biliotheque Bleue”, which
were low-priced small books printed on poor quality paper, and
bound in cheap blue covers. Then there were the romances, printed
on four to six pages, and the more substantial ‘histories’ which were
stories about the past. Books were of various sizes, serving many
different purposes and interests.
The periodical press developed from the early eighteenth century,
combining information about current affairs with entertainment.
Newspapers and journals carried information about wars and trade,
as well as news of developments in other places.
Similarly, the ideas of scientists and philosophers now became more
accessible to the common people. Ancient and medieval scientific
texts were compiled and published, and maps and scientific diagrams
were widely printed. When scientists like Isaac Newton began to
publish their discoveries, they could influence a much wider circle
of scientifically minded readers. The writings of thinkers such as
Thomas Paine, Voltaire and Jean Jacques Rousseau were also widely
printed and read. Thus their ideas about science, reason and rationality
found their way into popular literature.

their winter evenings in relating stories of witches,
ghosts, hobgoblins … now shorten the winter

them tales, romances, etc. If John goes to town

4.1 ‘Tremble, therefore, tyrants of the world!’
By the mid-eighteenth century, there was a common conviction that
books were a means of spreading progress and enlightenment. Many
believed that books could change the world,  liberate society from
despotism and tyranny, and herald a time when reason and intellect
would rule. Louise-Sebastien Mercier, a novelist in eighteenth-century
France, declared: ‘The printing press is the most powerful engine of
progress and public opinion is the force that will sweep despotism
away.’ In many of Mercier’s novels, the heroes are transformed by
acts of reading. They devour books, are lost in the world books
create, and become enlightened in the process.  Convinced of the
power of print in bringing enlightenment and destroying the basis
of despotism, Mercier proclaimed: ‘Tremble, therefore, tyrants of
the world! Tremble before the virtual writer!’
4.2 Print Culture and the French Revolution
Many historians have argued that print culture created the conditions
within which French Revolution occurred. Can we make such
a connection?
Three types of arguments have been usually put forward.
First: print popularised the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers.
Collectively, their writings provided a critical commentary on tradition,
superstition and despotism. They argued for the rule of reason rather
than custom, and demanded that everything be judged through the
application of reason and rationality. They attacked the sacred
authority of the Church and the despotic power of the state, thus
eroding the legitimacy of a social order based on tradition. The
writings of Voltaire and Rousseau were read widely; and those who
read these books saw the world through new eyes, eyes that were
questioning, critical and rational.
Second: print created a new culture of dialogue and debate. All
values, norms and institutions were re-evaluated and discussed by a
public that had become aware of the power of reason, and
recognised the need to question existing ideas and beliefs. Within
this public culture, new ideas of social revolution came into being.
Third: by the 1780s there was an outpouring of literature that mocked
the royalty and criticised their morality. In the process, it raised
This is how Mercier describes the impact of the
printed word, and the power of reading in one
of his books:
‘Anyone who had seen me reading would have
compared me to a man dying of thirst who was
gulping down some fresh, pure water … Lighting
my lamp with extraordinary caution, I threw
myself hungrily into the reading. An easy
eloquence, effortless and animated, carried me
from one page to the next without my noticing
it. A clock struck off the hours in the silence of
the shadows, and I heard nothing. My lamp began
to run out of oil and produced only a pale light,
but still I read on. I could not even take out time
to raise the wick for fear of interrupting my
pleasure. How those new ideas rushed into my
brain! How my intelligence adopted them!’

Discuss
questions about the existing social order. Cartoons and caricatures
typically suggested that the monarchy remained absorbed only in
sensual pleasures while the common people suffered  immense
hardships. This literature circulated underground and led to the
growth of hostile sentiments against the monarchy.
How do we look at these arguments?  There can be no doubt that
print helps the spread of ideas. But we must remember that people
did not read just one kind of literature. If they read the ideas of
Voltaire and Rousseau, they were also exposed to monarchical and
Church propaganda. They were not influenced directly by everything
they read or saw. They accepted some ideas and rejected others.
They interpreted things their own way. Print did not directly shape
their minds, but it did open up the possibility of thinking differently.

5  The Nineteenth Century
The nineteenth century saw vast leaps in mass literacy in Europe,
bringing in large numbers of new readers among children,
women and workers.
5.1 Children, Women and Workers
As primary education became compulsory from the late
nineteenth century, children became an important category
of readers. Production of school textbooks became critical
for the publishing industry. A children’s press, devoted to
literature for children alone, was set up in France in 1857.
This press published new works as well as old fairy tales
and folk tales. The Grimm Brothers in Germany spent years
compiling traditional folk tales gathered from peasants. What
they collected was edited before the stories were published
in a collection in 1812.  Anything  that was considered
unsuitable for children or would appear vulgar to the elites,
was not included in the  published version.  Rural folk tales
thus acquired a new form. In this way, print recorded old
tales but also changed them.
Women became important as readers as well as writers. Penny
magazines (see Fig. 12) were especially meant for women, as
were manuals teaching proper behaviour and housekeeping.
When novels began to be written in the nineteenth century,
women were seen as important readers. Some of the best-
known novelists were women: Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters,
George Eliot. Their writings became important in defining a new
type of woman:  a person with will, strength of personality,
determination and the power to think.
Lending libraries had been in existence from the seventeenth century
onwards. In the nineteenth century, lending libraries in England
became instruments for educating white-collar workers, artisans
and lower-middle-class people. Sometimes, self-educated working
class people wrote for themselves. After the working day was
gradually shortened from the mid-nineteenth century, workers had
some time for self-improvement and self-expression. They wrote
political tracts and autobiographies in large numbers.
Thomas Wood, a Yorkshire mechanic, narrated
how he would rent old newspapers and read
them by firelight in the evenings as he could not
afford candles. Autobiographies of poor people
narrated their struggles to read against grim
obstacles: the twentieth-century Russian
revolutionary author Maxim Gorky’s My Childhood
and My University provide glimpses of such
struggles.

5.2 Further Innovations
By the late eighteenth century, the press came to be made out of
metal. Through the nineteenth century, there were a series of further
innovations in printing technology. By the mid-nineteenth century,
Richard M. Hoe of New York had perfected the power-driven
cylindrical press. This was capable of printing 8,000 sheets per hour.
This press was particularly useful for printing newspapers.  In the
late nineteenth century, the offset press was developed which could
print up to six colours at a time. From the turn of the twentieth
century, electrically operated presses accelerated printing operations.
A series of other developments followed. Methods of feeding paper
improved, the quality of plates became better, automatic paper reels
and photoelectric controls of the colour register were introduced.
The accumulation of several individual mechanical improvements
transformed the appearance of printed texts.
Printers and publishers continuously developed new strategies
to sell their product. Nineteenth-century periodicals serialised
important novels, which gave birth to a particular way of writing
novels.  In the 1920s in England, popular works were sold in
cheap series, called the Shilling Series. The dust cover or the
book jacket is also a twentieth-century innovation. With the
onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, publishers feared a
decline in book purchases. To sustain buying, they brought
out cheap paperback editions.

6  India and the World of Print
Let us see when printing began in India and how ideas and information
were written before the age of print.
6.1 Manuscripts Before the Age of Print
India had a very rich and old tradition of handwritten manuscripts –
in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, as well as in various vernacular languages.
Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper.
Pages were sometimes beautifully illustrated. They would be either
pressed between wooden covers or sewn together to ensure
preservation. Manuscripts continued to be produced till well after
the introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century.
Manuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had
to be handled carefully, and they  could not be read easily as the

Handwritten manuscripts continued to be produced in India till much after
the coming of print. This manuscript was produced in the eighteenth
century in the Malayalam script.
script was written in different styles. So
manuscripts were not widely used in
everyday life. Even though pre-colonial
Bengal had developed an extensive network
of village primary schools, students very
often did not read texts. They only learnt
to write. Teachers dictated portions of
texts from memory and students wrote
them down. Many thus became literate
without ever actually reading any kinds
of texts.
6.2 Print Comes to India
The printing press first came to Goa with Portuguese missionaries
in the mid-sixteenth century. Jesuit priests learnt Konkani and
printed several tracts. By 1674, about 50 books had been printed
in the Konkani and in Kanara languages. Catholic priests printed
the first Tamil book in 1579 at Cochin, and in 1713 the first
Malayalam book was printed by them. By 1710, Dutch Protestant
missionaries had printed 32 Tamil texts, many of them translations
of older works.
The English language press did not grow in India till quite late even
though the English East India Company began to import presses
from the late seventeenth century.
From 1780, James Augustus Hickey began to edit the Bengal Gazette,
a weekly magazine that described itself as ‘a commercial paper open
to all, but influenced by none’. So it was private English enterprise,
proud of its independence from colonial influence, that began English
printing in India. Hickey published a lot of advertisements, including
those that related to the import and sale of slaves. But he also
published a lot of gossip about the Company’s senior officials in
India. Enraged by this, Governor-General Warren Hastings
persecuted Hickey, and encouraged the publication of officially
sanctioned newspapers that could counter the flow of information
that damaged the image of the colonial government. By the
close of the eighteenth century, a number of newspapers and
journals appeared in print. There were Indians, too, who began
to publish Indian newspapers. The first to appear was the weekly
Bengal Gazette, brought out by Gangadhar Bhattacharya, who
was close to Rammohun Roy.
As late as 1768, a William Bolts affixed a notice
on a public building in Calcutta:
‘To the Public: Mr. Bolts takes this method of
informing the public that the want of a printing
press in this city being of a great disadvantage in
business ... he is going to give the best
encouragement to any ... persons who are
versed in the business of printing.’
Bolts, however, left for England soon after and
nothing came of the promise.

7  Religious Reform and Public Debates
From the early nineteenth century, as you know, there were intense
debates around religious issues. Different groups confronted the
changes happening within colonial society in different ways, and
offered a variety of new interpretations of the beliefs of different
religions. Some criticised existing practices and campaigned for
reform, while others countered the arguments of reformers. These
debates were carried out in public and in print. Printed tracts and
newspapers not only spread the new ideas, but they shaped the
nature of the debate. A wider public could now participate in these
public discussions and express their views. New ideas emerged
through these clashes of opinions.
This was a time of intense controversies between social and religious
reformers and the Hindu orthodoxy over matters like widow
immolation, monotheism, Brahmanical priesthood and idolatry. In
Bengal, as the debate developed, tracts and newspapers proliferated,
circulating a variety of arguments. To reach a wider audience, the
ideas were printed in the everyday, spoken language of ordinary
people. Rammohun Roy published the Sambad Kaumudi from 1821
and the Hindu orthodoxy commissioned the Samachar Chandrika
to oppose his opinions. From 1822, two Persian newspapers were
published, Jam-i-Jahan Nama and Shamsul Akhbar. In the same year,
a Gujarati newspaper, the Bombay Samachar, made its appearance.
In north India, the ulama were deeply anxious about the collapse
of Muslim dynasties. They feared that colonial rulers would
encourage conversion, change the Muslim personal laws. To counter
this, they used cheap lithographic presses, published Persian and
Urdu translations of holy scriptures, and printed religious
newspapers and tracts. The Deoband Seminary, founded in 1867,
published thousands upon thousands of fatwas telling Muslim

nineteenth century, a number of Muslim sects and seminaries
appeared, each with a different interpretation of faith, each keen
on enlarging its following and countering the influence of its
opponents. Urdu print helped them conduct these battles in public.

the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, a sixteenth-century text, came out
from Calcutta in 1810. By the mid-nineteenth century, cheap
lithographic editions flooded north Indian markets. From the 1880s,
the Naval Kishore Press at Lucknow and the Shri Venkateshwar
Press in Bombay published numerous religious texts in vernaculars.
In their printed and portable form, these could be read easily by the
faithful at any place and time. They could also be read out to large
groups of illiterate men and women.
Religious texts, therefore, reached a very wide circle of people,
encouraging discussions, debates and controversies within and
among different religions.       
Print did not only stimulate the publication of conflicting opinions
amongst communities, but it also connected communities and people
in different parts of India. Newspapers conveyed news from one
place to another, creating pan-Indian identities.
Why Newspapers?
‘Krishnaji Trimbuck Ranade inhabitant of Poona intends to publish a Newspaper in the Marathi Language with a view of
affording useful information on every topic of local interest. It will be open for free discussion on subjects of general utility,
scientific investigation and the speculations connected with the antiquities, statistics, curiosities, history and geography of
the country and of the Deccan especially… the patronage and support of all interested in the diffusion of knowledge and
Welfare of the People is earnestly solicited.’
Bombay Telegraph and Courier, 6 January 1849
‘The task of the native newspapers and political associations is identical to the role of the Opposition in the House of
Commons in Parliament in England. That is of critically examining government policy to suggest improvements, by removing
those parts that will not be to the benefit of the people, and also by ensuring speedy implementation.
These associations ought to carefully study the particular issues, gather diverse relevant information on the nation as well
as on what are the possible and desirable improvements, and this will surely earn it considerable influence.’
Native Opinion, 3 April 1870.

8  New Forms of Publication
Printing created an appetite for new kinds of writing. As more and
more people could now read, they wanted to see their own lives,
experiences, emotions and relationships reflected in what they read.
The novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally
catered to this need. It soon acquired distinctively Indian forms and
styles. For readers, it opened up new worlds of experience, and
gave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives.
Other new literary forms also entered the world of reading –
lyrics, short stories, essays about social and political matters. In
different ways, they reinforced the new emphasis on human lives
and intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped
such things.
By the end of the nineteenth century, a new visual
culture was taking shape. With the setting up of an
increasing number of printing presses, visual images
could be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters
like Raja Ravi Varma produced images for mass
circulation. Poor wood engravers who made
woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and
were employed by print shops. Cheap prints and
calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be
bought even by the poor to decorate the walls of
their homes or places of work. These prints began
shaping popular ideas about modernity and tradition,
religion and politics, and society and culture.
By the 1870s, caricatures and cartoons were being
published in journals and newspapers, commenting
on social and political issues. Some caricatures
ridiculed the educated Indians’ fascination with
Western tastes and clothes, while others expressed
the fear of social change. There were imperial
caricatures lampooning nationalists, as well as
nationalist cartoons criticising imperial rule.

8.1     Women and Print
Lives and feelings of women began to be written in particularly
vivid and intense ways. Women’s reading, therefore, increased
enormously in middle-class homes.  Liberal husbands and fathers
began educating their womenfolk at home, and sent them to schools
when women’s schools were set up in the cities and towns after the
mid-nineteenth century. Many journals began carrying writings by
women, and explained why women should be educated. They also
carried a syllabus and attached suitable reading matter which could
be used for home-based schooling.
But not all families were liberal. Conservative Hindus believed
that a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that
educated women would be corrupted by reading Urdu romances.
Sometimes, rebel women defied such prohibition. We know the
story of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of north India
who secretly learnt to read and write in Urdu. Her family wanted
her to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand.
So she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own. In
East Bengal, in the early nineteenth century, Rashsundari Debi, a
young married girl in a very orthodox household, learnt to read in
the secrecy of her kitchen. Later, she wrote her autobiography
Amar Jiban which was published in 1876. It was the first full-length
autobiography published in the Bengali language.
Since social reforms and novels had already created a great interest
in women’s lives and emotions, there was also an interest in what
women would have to say about their own lives. From the 1860s,
a few Bengali women like Kailashbashini Debi wrote books
highlighting the experiences of women – about how women were
imprisoned at home, kept in ignorance, forced to do hard domestic
labour and treated unjustly by the very people they served. In the
1880s, in present-day Maharashtra, Tarabai Shinde and Pandita
Ramabai wrote with passionate anger about the miserable lives
of upper-caste Hindu women, especially widows. A woman in a
Tamil novel expressed what reading meant to women who were
so greatly confined by social regulations:  ‘For various reasons, my
world is small … More than half my life’s happiness has come
from books …’
While Urdu, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi print culture had developed
early, Hindi printing began seriously only from the 1870s. Soon, a
large segment of it was devoted to the education of women. In

The Indian Charivari was one of the many
journals of caricature and satire published in
the late nineteenth century.

positioned right at the centre. He is
authoritative and imperial; telling the natives
what is to be done. The natives sit on either
side of him, servile and submissive. The

British journal of cartoons and satire. You can
almost hear the British master say – ‘This is
the model, produce Indian versions of it.’

In 1926, Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossein, a
noted educationist and literary figure, strongly
condemned men for withholding education from
women in the name of religion as she addressed
the Bengal Women’s Education Conference:  
‘The opponents of female education say that
women will become unruly … Fie! They call
themselves Muslims and yet go against the basic
tenet of Islam which gives Women an equal right
to education. If men are not led astray once
educated, why should women?’

the early twentieth century, journals, written for and sometimes
edited by women, became extremely popular. They discussed
issues like women’s education, widowhood, widow remarriage
and the national movement. Some of them offered household
and fashion lessons to women and brought entertainment through
short stories and serialised novels.
In Punjab, too, a similar folk literature was widely printed from
the early twentieth century. Ram Chaddha published the fast-selling
Istri Dharm Vichar to teach women how to be obedient wives.
The Khalsa Tract Society published cheap booklets with a similar
message. Many of these were in the form of dialogues about the
qualities of a good woman.
In Bengal, an entire area in central Calcutta – the Battala – was
devoted to the printing of popular books. Here you could buy
cheap editions of religious tracts and scriptures, as well as literature
that was considered obscene and scandalous. By the late nineteenth
century, a lot of these books were being profusely illustrated with
woodcuts and coloured lithographs. Pedlars took the Battala
publications to homes, enabling women to read them in their
leisure time.

8.2 Print and the Poor People
Very cheap small books were brought to markets in nineteenth-century
Madras towns and sold at crossroads, allowing poor people travelling
to markets to buy them. Public libraries were set up from the early
twentieth century, expanding the access to books. These libraries were
located mostly in cities and towns, and at times in prosperous villages.
For rich local patrons, setting up a library was a way of acquiring prestige.
From the late nineteenth century, issues of caste discrimination began to
be written about in many printed tracts and essays. Jyotiba Phule, the
Maratha pioneer of ‘low caste’ protest movements, wrote about the
injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). In the twentieth
century, B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker
in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and
their writings were read by people all over India. Local protest
movements and sects also created a lot of popular journals and tracts
criticising ancient scriptures and envisioning a new and just future.
Workers in factories were too overworked and lacked the education to
write much about their experiences. But Kashibaba, a Kanpur
millworker, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1938 to
show the links between caste and class exploitation.  The poems of
another Kanpur millworker, who wrote under the name of Sudarshan
Chakr between 1935 and 1955, were brought together and published
in a collection called Sacchi Kavitayan. By the 1930s, Bangalore cotton
millworkers set up libraries to educate themselves, following the example
of Bombay workers. These were sponsored by social reformers who
tried to restrict excessive drinking among them, to bring literacy and,
sometimes, to propagate the message of nationalism.

9  Print and Censorship
Before 1798, the colonial state under the East India Company was
not too concerned with censorship. Strangely, its early measures to
control printed matter were directed against Englishmen in India
who were critical of Company misrule and hated the actions of
particular Company officers. The Company was worried that such
criticisms might be used by its critics in England to attack its trade
monopoly in India.
By the 1820s, the Calcutta Supreme Court passed certain regulations
to control press freedom and the Company began encouraging
publication of newspapers that would celebrate Britsh rule. In 1835,
faced with urgent petitions by editors of English and vernacular
newspapers, Governor-General Bentinck agreed to revise press laws.
Thomas Macaulay, a liberal colonial official, formulated new rules
that restored the earlier freedoms.
After the revolt of 1857, the attitude to freedom of the press
changed. Enraged Englishmen demanded a clamp down on the
‘native’ press. As vernacular newspapers became assertively
nationalist, the colonial government began debating measures of
stringent control.  In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed,
modelled on the Irish Press Laws. It provided the government
with extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the vernacular
press. From now on the government kept regular track of the
vernacular newspapers published in different provinces. When a
report was judged as seditious, the newspaper was warned, and if
the warning was ignored, the press was liable to be seized and the
printing machinery confiscated.
Despite repressive measures, nationalist newspapers grew in numbers
in all parts of India. They reported on colonial misrule and
encouraged nationalist activities. Attempts to throttle nationalist
criticism provoked militant protest. This in turn led to a renewed
cycle of persecution and protests. When Punjab revolutionaries were
deported in 1907, Balgangadhar Tilak wrote with great sympathy
about them in his Kesari. This led to his imprisonment in 1908,
provoking in turn widespread protests all over India.
Box 4
Sometimes, the government found it hard to
find candidates for editorship of loyalist papers.
When Sanders, editor of the Statesman that had
been founded in 1877, was approached, he
asked rudely how much he would be paid
for suffering the loss of freedom. The Friend
of India refused a government subsidy, fearing
that this would force it to be obedient to
government commands.
Box 5
The power of the printed word is most often
seen in the way governments seek to regulate
and suppress print. The colonial government kept
continuous track of all books and newspapers
published in India and passed numerous laws to
control the press.
During the First World War, under the Defence
of India Rules, 22 newspapers had to furnish
securities. Of these, 18 shut down rather than
comply with government orders. The Sedition
Committee Report under Rowlatt in 1919 further
strengthened controls that led to imposition of
penalties on various newspapers. At the outbreak
of the Second World War, the Defence of India
Act was passed, allowing censoring of reports of
war-related topics. All reports about the Quit India
movement came under its purview. In August
1942, about 90 newspapers were suppressed.

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 recommends that children’s life
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system
and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks
developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries
between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National
Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue
imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and
freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed
on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar
so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves
for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of  stress or
boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by
restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for
child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance
this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation
and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on
experience.
NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the Advisory Group
on Social Science, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book,
Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya for guiding the  work of this committee. Several

Introduction
We live in a world where the existence of nations is taken for granted. We see people as
belonging to nations and having a nationality, and we assume that this sense of belonging
has existed from time immemorial. We consider countries as the same as nations, and use
the two terms as synonyms, making little distinction between them. We think of countries
as unified entities, each with a demarcated international boundary, a defined territory, a
national language, and a central government.
Yet if we were to travel in a time capsule to the mid-eighteenth century and look for nations
as we know them today, we would not find them. If we were to ask people about their
nationality, about their national identity, they would not understand our questions. For at that
time, nations did not exist in their modern form. People lived within kingdoms, small states,
principalities, chiefdoms and duchies, not within nations. As Eric Hobsbawm, a famous historian,
once said, the most remarkable fact about the modern nation is its modernity. The history of
its existence is no more than 250 years old.
How did the modern nation come into being? How did people begin to see themselves as
belonging to a nation?
The sense of belonging to a nation developed only over a period of time. The first two
chapters (in Section I) of this book will trace this history. You will see how the idea of nationalism
emerged in Europe, how territories were unified, and national governments formed. It was a
process that took many decades, involved many wars and revolutions, many ideological battles
and political conflicts. From a discussion of Europe (Chapter I) we will shift our focus to the
growth of nationalism in India (Chapter II), where nationalism was shaped by the experience
of colonialism and the anti-imperialist movement. It will help you understand how nationalism
in colonial countries can develop in a variety  of ways, glorify contrasting ideals, and be  linked
to different modes of struggle.
The story of nationalism in these chapters will move at several levels. You will of course read
about great leaders like Giuseppe Mazzini and Mahatma Gandhi. But we cannot understand
nationalism only by knowing about the words and deeds of important leaders, and the big
and dramatic events they led and participated in. We have to also look at the aspirations and
activities of ordinary people, see how nationalism is expressed in small events of everyday life,
and shaped by a variety of seemingly dissimilar and unrelated social movements.  To understand
how nationalism spreads, we need to know not only what the leaders said, but also how their
words were understood and interpreted by people. If we are to think about how people
begin to identify with a nation, we must see not only the political events that are critical to the
process, but also how nationalist sensibilities are nurtured by artists and writers, and through
art and literature, songs and tales.
In Section II, we will shift our focus to economies and livelihoods. Last year you read about
those social groups — pastoralists and forest dwellers — who are often seen as survivors
from past times when in fact they are very much part of the modern world we live in. This
year we will focus on developments that are seen as symbolising modernity – globalisation
and  industrialisation –  and see the many sides of the history of these developments.
In Chapter III you will see how the global world has emerged out of a long and complicated
history. From ancient times, pilgrims, traders, travelers have traversed distances, carrying goods,
information and skills, linking societies in ways that often had contradictory consequences.

Items of food and species of plants spread from one region to another, transferring
information and taste, as well as disease and death. As Western powers carried the flag of
‘civilisation’ deep into different parts of Africa, precious metals and slaves were taken
away to Europe and America. When coffee and sugar were grown in the Caribbean
plantations for the world market, an oppressive system of indentured labour came into
being in India and China to supply workers for the plantations.
Section III will introduce you to the history of print culture. Surrounded by things that
appear in print, we might find it difficult today to imagine a time when printing was still
unknown. Chapter V will trace how the history of the contemporary world is intimately
connected with the growth of print. You will see how printing made possible the spread
of information and ideas, debates and discussions, advertising and propaganda, and a
variety of new forms of literature.
When we discuss such themes of everyday life, we begin to see how history can help us
reflect on even the seemingly ordinary things in the world.

Nationalism   in   Europe
In 1848, Frédéric Sorrieu, a French artist, prepared a series of four
prints visualising his dream of a world made up of ‘democratic
and social Republics’, as he called them. The first print (Fig. 1) of the
series, shows the peoples of Europe and America – men and women
of all ages and social classes – marching in a long train, and offering
homage to the statue of Liberty as they pass by it. As you would
recall, artists of the time of the French Revolution personified Liberty
as a female figure – here you can recognise the torch of Enlightenment
she bears in one hand and the Charter of the Rights of Man in the
other. On the earth in the foreground of the image lie the shattered
remains of the symbols of absolutist institutions. In Sorrieu’s
utopian vision, the peoples of the world are grouped as distinct
nations, identified through their flags and national costume. Leading
the procession, way past the statue of Liberty, are the United States
and Switzerland, which by this time were already nation-states. France,

She is followed by the peoples of Germany, bearing the black, red
and gold flag. Interestingly, at the time when Sorrieu created this
image, the German peoples did not yet exist as a united nation – the
flag they carry is an expression of liberal hopes in 1848 to unify the
numerous German-speaking principalities into a nation-state under
a democratic constitution. Following the German peoples are the
peoples of Austria, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Lombardy,
Poland, England, Ireland, Hungary and Russia. From the heavens
above, Christ, saints and angels gaze upon the scene. They have
been used by the artist to symbolise fraternity among the nations of
the world.
This chapter will deal with many of the issues visualised by Sorrieu
in Fig. 1. During the nineteenth century, nationalism emerged as a
force which brought about sweeping changes in the political and
mental world of Europe. The end result of these changes was the
emergence of the nation-state in place of the multi-national dynastic
empires of Europe. The concept and practices of a modern state, in
which a centralised power exercised sovereign control over a clearly
defined territory, had been developing over a long period of time
in Europe. But a nation-state was one in which the majority of its
citizens, and not only its rulers, came to develop a sense of common
identity and shared history or descent. This commonness did not
exist from time immemorial; it was forged through struggles, through
the actions of leaders and the common people. This chapter will
look at the diverse processes through which nation-states and
nationalism came into being in nineteenth-century Europe.
Ernst Renan, ‘What is a Nation?’
In a lecture delivered at the University of
Sorbonne in 1882, the French philosopher Ernst
Renan (1823-92) outlined his understanding of
what makes a nation. The lecture  was
subsequently published as a famous essay entitled
‘Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?’ (‘What is a Nation?’).
In this essay Renan criticises the notion suggested
by others that a nation is formed by a common
language, race, religion, or territory:
‘A nation is the culmination of a long past of
endeavours, sacrifice and devotion. A heroic past,
great men, glory, that is the social capital upon
which one bases a national idea. To have
common glories in the past, to have a common
will in the present, to have performed great deeds
together, to wish to perform still more, these
are the essential conditions of being a people. A
nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity … Its
existence is a daily plebiscite … A province is its
inhabitants; if anyone has the right to be
consulted, it is the inhabitant. A nation never
has any real interest in annexing or holding on to
a country against its will. The existence of nations
is a good thing, a necessity even. Their existence
is a guarantee of liberty, which would be lost if
the world had only one law and only one master.’

Nationalism   in   Europe
1  The French Revolution and the Idea of the Nation
The first clear expression of nationalism came with
the French Revolution in 1789. France, as you
would remember, was a full-fledged territorial state
in 1789 under the rule of an absolute monarch.
The political and constitutional changes that came
in the wake of the French Revolution led to the
transfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to a
body of French citizens. The revolution proclaimed
that it was the people who would henceforth
constitute the nation and shape its destiny.
From the very beginning, the French revolutionaries
introduced various measures and practices that
could create a sense of collective identity amongst
the French people. The ideas of la patrie (the
fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasised
the notion of a united community enjoying equal rights under a
constitution. A new French flag, the tricolour,   was chosen to replace
the former royal standard. The Estates General  was elected by the
body of active citizens and renamed the National Assembly. New
hymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated,
all in the name of the nation. A centralised administrative system
was put in place and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens
within its territory. Internal customs duties and dues were abolished
and a uniform system of weights and measures was adopted.
Regional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken
and written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.
The revolutionaries further declared that it was the mission and the
destiny of the French nation to liberate the peoples of Europe
from despotism, in other words to help other peoples of Europe
to become nations.
When the news of the events in France reached the different cities
of Europe, students and other members of educated middle classes
began setting up Jacobin clubs. Their activities and campaigns
prepared the way for the French armies which moved into Holland,
Belgium, Switzerland and much of Italy in the 1790s. With the
outbreak of the revolutionary wars, the French armies began to
carry the idea of nationalism abroad.

Within the wide swathe of territory that came under his control,
Napoleon set about introducing many of the reforms that he had
already introduced in France. Through a return to monarchy
Napoleon had, no doubt, destroyed democracy in France, but in
the administrative field he had incorporated revolutionary principles
in order to make the whole system more rational and efficient. The
Civil Code of 1804 – usually known as the Napoleonic Code –
did away with all privileges based on birth, established  equality
before the law and secured  the right to property. This Code was
exported to the regions under French control. In the Dutch Republic,
in Switzerland, in Italy and Germany, Napoleon simplified
administrative divisions, abolished the feudal system and freed
peasants from serfdom and manorial dues. In the towns too, guild
restrictions were removed. Transport and communication systems
were improved. Peasants, artisans, workers and new businessmen

enjoyed a new-found freedom. Businessmen and small-scale
producers of goods, in particular, began to realise that uniform
laws, standardised weights and measures, and a common national
currency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods
and capital from one region to another.
However, in the areas conquered, the reactions of the local
populations to French rule were mixed. Initially, in many places such
as Holland and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like Brussels,
Mainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French armies were welcomed as
harbingers of liberty. But the initial enthusiasm soon turned to hostility,
as it became clear that the new administrative arrangements did not
go hand in hand with political freedom. Increased taxation,
censorship, forced conscription into the French armies required to
conquer the rest of Europe, all seemed to outweigh the advantages
of the administrative changes.

The subject of this colour print by the German painter Karl Kaspar Fritz is the occupation of the town of Zweibrücken
by the French armies. French soldiers, recognisable by their blue, white and red uniforms, have been portrayed as
oppressors as they seize a peasant’s cart (left), harass some young women (centre foreground) and force a peasant
down to his knees. The plaque being affixed to the Tree of Liberty carries a German inscription which in translation
reads: ‘Take freedom and equality from us, the model of humanity.’ This is a sarcastic reference to the claim of the
French as being liberators who opposed monarchy in the territories they entered.

If you look at the map of mid-eighteenth-century Europe you will
find that there were no ‘nation-states’ as we know them today.
What we know today as Germany, Italy and Switzerland were
divided into kingdoms, duchies and cantons whose rulers had their
autonomous territories. Eastern and Central Europe were under
autocratic monarchies within the territories of which lived diverse
peoples. They did not see themselves as sharing a collective identity
or a common culture. Often, they even spoke different languages
and belonged to different ethnic groups. The Habsburg Empire
that ruled over Austria-Hungary, for example, was a patchwork of
many different regions and peoples. It included the Alpine regions
– the Tyrol, Austria and the Sudetenland – as well as Bohemia,
where the aristocracy was predominantly German-speaking. It also
included the Italian-speaking provinces of Lombardy and Venetia.
In Hungary, half of the population spoke Magyar while the other
half spoke a variety of dialects. In Galicia, the aristocracy spoke
Polish. Besides these three dominant groups, there also lived within
the boundaries of the empire, a mass of subject peasant peoples –
Bohemians and Slovaks to the north, Slovenes in Carniola, Croats
to the south, and Roumans to the east in Transylvania. Such
differences did not easily promote a sense of political unity. The
only tie binding these diverse groups together was a common
allegiance to the emperor.
How did nationalism and the idea of the nation-state emerge?
2.1 The Aristocracy and the New Middle Class
Socially and politically, a landed aristocracy was the dominant class
on the continent. The members of this class were united by a
common way of life that cut across regional divisions. They owned
estates in the countryside and also town-houses. They spoke French
for purposes of diplomacy and in high society. Their families were
often connected by ties of marriage. This powerful aristocracy was,
however, numerically a small group. The majority of the population
was made up of the peasantry. To the west, the bulk of the land
was farmed by tenants and small owners, while in Eastern and
Central Europe the pattern of landholding was characterised by
vast estates which were cultivated by serfs.

Nationalism   in   Europe
In Western and parts of Central Europe the growth of industrial
production and trade meant the growth of towns and the emergence
of commercial classes whose existence was based on production
for the market. Industrialisation began in England in the second
half of the eighteenth century, but in France and parts of the German
states it occurred only during the nineteenth century. In its wake,
new social groups came into being: a working-class population, and
middle classes made up of industrialists, businessmen, professionals.
In Central and Eastern Europe these groups were smaller in number
till late nineteenth century. It was among the educated, liberal middle
classes that ideas of national unity following the abolition of
aristocratic privileges gained popularity.
2.2 What did Liberal Nationalism Stand for?
Ideas of national unity in early-nineteenth-century Europe were closely
allied to the ideology of liberalism. The term ‘liberalism’ derives
from the Latin root liber, meaning free. For the new middle classes
liberalism stood for freedom for the individual and equality of all
before the law. Politically, it emphasised the concept of government
by consent. Since the French Revolution, liberalism had stood for
the end of autocracy and clerical privileges, a constitution and
representative government through parliament. Nineteenth-century
liberals also stressed the inviolability of private property.
Yet, equality before the law did not necessarily stand for universal
suffrage. You will recall that in revolutionary France, which marked
the first political experiment in liberal democracy, the right to vote
and to get elected was granted exclusively to property-owning men.
Men without property and all women were excluded from political
rights. Only for a brief period under the Jacobins did all adult males
enjoy suffrage. However, the Napoleonic Code went back to limited
suffrage and reduced women to the status of a minor, subject to
the authority of fathers and husbands. Throughout the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries women and non-propertied men
organised opposition movements demanding equal political rights.
In the economic sphere, liberalism stood for the freedom of markets
and the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement
of goods and capital. During the nineteenth century this was a strong
demand of the emerging middle classes. Let us take the example of
the German-speaking regions in the first half of the nineteenth
century. Napoleon’s administrative measures had created out of

countless small principalities a confederation of 39 states. Each of
these possessed its own currency, and weights and measures. A
merchant travelling in 1833 from Hamburg to Nuremberg to sell
his goods would have had to pass through 11 customs barriers and
pay a customs duty of about 5 per cent at each one of them. Duties
were often levied according to the weight or measurement of the
goods. As each region had its own system of weights and measures,
this involved time-consuming calculation. The measure of cloth,
for example, was the elle  which in each region stood for a different
length. An elle of textile material bought in Frankfurt would get you
54.7 cm of cloth, in Mainz 55.1 cm, in Nuremberg 65.6 cm, in
Freiburg 53.5 cm.
Such conditions were viewed as obstacles to economic exchange
and growth by the new commercial classes, who argued for the
creation of a unified economic territory allowing the unhindered
movement of goods, people and capital.  In 1834, a customs union
or zollverein was formed at the initiative of Prussia and joined by
most of the German states. The union abolished tariff barriers and
reduced the number of currencies from over thirty to two. The
creation of a network of railways further stimulated mobility,
harnessing economic interests to national unification. A wave of
economic nationalism strengthened the wider nationalist sentiments
growing at the time.
2.3 A New Conservatism after 1815
Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, European governments
were driven by a spirit of conservatism. Conservatives believed
that established, traditional institutions of state and society –  like the
monarchy, the Church, social hierarchies, property and the family –
should be preserved. Most conservatives, however, did not propose
a return to the society of pre-revolutionary days. Rather, they realised,
from the changes initiated by Napoleon, that modernisation could
in fact strengthen traditional institutions like the monarchy. It could
make  state  power more effective and strong. A modern army, an
efficient bureaucracy, a dynamic economy, the abolition of feudalism
and serfdom could strengthen the autocratic monarchies of Europe.
In 1815, representatives of the European powers – Britain, Russia,
Prussia and Austria – who had collectively defeated Napoleon, met
at Vienna to draw up a settlement for Europe. The Congress was
hosted by the Austrian Chancellor Duke Metternich. The delegates
Economists began to think in terms of the national
economy. They talked of how the nation could
develop and what economic measures could help
forge this nation together.
Friedrich List, Professor of Economics at the
University of Tübingen in Germany, wrote in 1834:
‘The aim of the zollverein is to bind the Germans
economically into a nation. It will strengthen the
nation materially as much by protecting its
interests externally as by stimulating its internal
productivity. It ought to awaken and raise
national sentiment through a fusion of individual
and provincial interests. The German people have
realised that a free economic system is the only
means to engender national feeling.’

drew up the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 with the object of undoing
most of the changes that had come about in Europe during the
Napoleonic wars. The Bourbon dynasty, which had been deposed
during the French Revolution, was restored to power, and France
lost the territories it had annexed under Napoleon. A series of states
were set up on the boundaries of France to prevent French expansion
in future. Thus the kingdom of the Netherlands, which included
Belgium, was set up in the north and Genoa was added to Piedmont
in the south. Prussia was given important new territories on its western
frontiers, while Austria was given control of northern Italy. But the
German confederation of 39 states that had been set up by Napoleon
was left untouched. In the east, Russia was given part of Poland
while Prussia was given a portion of Saxony. The main intention
was to restore the monarchies that had been overthrown by
Napoleon, and create a new conservative order in Europe.
Conservative regimes set up in 1815 were autocratic. They did not
tolerate criticism and dissent, and sought to curb activities that
questioned the legitimacy of autocratic governments.  Most of them
imposed censorship laws to control what was said in newspapers,
books, plays and songs and reflected the ideas of liberty and freedom

associated with the French Revolution. The memory of the French
Revolution nonetheless continued to inspire liberals. One of the major
issues taken up by the liberal-nationalists, who criticised the new
conservative order, was freedom of the press.
2.4 The Revolutionaries
During the years following 1815, the fear of repression drove
many liberal-nationalists underground. Secret societies sprang
up in many European states to train revolutionaries and spread
their ideas. To be revolutionary at this time meant a commitment
to oppose monarchical forms that had been established after
the Vienna Congress, and to fight for liberty and freedom. Most
of these revolutionaries also saw the creation of nation-states as
a necessary part of this struggle for freedom.
One such individual was the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe
Mazzini. Born in Genoa in 1805, he became a member of the
secret society of the Carbonari. As a young man of 24, he was
sent into exile in 1831 for attempting a revolution in Liguria.
He subsequently founded two more underground societies,
first, Young Italy in Marseilles, and then, Young Europe in
Berne, whose members were like-minded young men from
Poland, France, Italy and the German states. Mazzini believed
that God had intended nations to be the natural units of
mankind. So Italy could not continue to be a patchwork of
small states and kingdoms. It had to be forged into a single
unified republic within a wider alliance of nations. This
unification alone could be the basis of Italian liberty. Following
his model, secret societies were set up in Germany, France,
Switzerland and Poland. Mazzini’s relentless opposition to
monarchy and his vision of democratic republics frightened the
conservatives.  Metternich described him as ‘the most dangerous
enemy of our social order’.

Nationalism   in   Europe
3  The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848
As conservative regimes tried to consolidate their power, liberalism
and nationalism came to be increasingly associated with revolution
in many regions of Europe such as the Italian and German states,
the provinces of the Ottoman Empire, Ireland and Poland. These
revolutions were led by the liberal-nationalists belonging to the
educated middle-class elite, among whom were professors, school-
teachers, clerks and members of the commercial middle classes.
The first upheaval took place in France in July 1830.  The Bourbon
kings who had been restored to power during the conservative
reaction after 1815, were now overthrown by liberal revolutionaries
who installed a constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its
head. ‘When France sneezes,’ Metternich once remarked, ‘the rest of
Europe catches cold.’  The July Revolution sparked an uprising in
Brussels which led to Belgium breaking away from the United
Kingdom of the Netherlands.
An event that mobilised nationalist feelings among the educated elite
across Europe was the Greek war of independence. Greece had
been part of the Ottoman Empire since the fifteenth century. The
growth of revolutionary nationalism in Europe sparked off a struggle
for independence amongst the Greeks which began in 1821.
Nationalists in Greece got support from other Greeks living in exile
and also from many West Europeans who had sympathies for ancient
Greek culture. Poets and artists lauded Greece as the cradle of
European civilisation and mobilised public opinion to support its
struggle against a Muslim empire. The English poet Lord Byron
organised funds and later went to fight in the war, where he died of
fever in 1824. Finally, the Treaty of Constantinople of 1832
recognised Greece as an independent nation.
3.1 The Romantic Imagination and National Feeling
The development of nationalism did not come about only through
wars and territorial expansion. Culture played an important role in
creating the idea of the nation: art and poetry, stories and music
helped express and shape nationalist feelings.
Let us look at Romanticism, a cultural movement which sought to
develop a particular form of nationalist sentiment. Romantic artists
and poets generally criticised the glorification of reason and science

20,000 Greeks were said to have been killed by Turks on the island of Chios. By
dramatising the incident, focusing on the suffering of women and children, and
using vivid colours, Delacroix sought to appeal to the emotions of the spectators,
and create sympathy for the Greeks.
and focused instead on emotions, intuition and mystical feelings.
Their effort was to create a sense of a shared collective heritage, a
common cultural past, as the basis of a nation.
Other Romantics such as the German philosopher Johann Gottfried
Herder (1744-1803) claimed that true German culture was to be
discovered among the common people – das volk. It was through
folk songs, folk poetry and folk dances that the true spirit of the
nation (volksgeist) was popularised. So collecting and recording these
forms of folk culture was essential to the project of nation-building.

The Grimm Brothers: Folktales and
Nation-building
Grimms’ Fairy Tales is a familiar name. The brothers
Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were born in the
German city of Hanau in 1785 and 1786
respectively. While both of them studied law,
they soon developed an interest in collecting old
folktales. They spent six years travelling from
village to village, talking to people and writing
down fairy tales, which were handed down
through the generations. These were popular
both among children and adults. In 1812, they
published their first collection of tales.
Subsequently, both the brothers became active
in liberal politics, especially the movement
for freedom of the press. In the meantime they
also published a 33-volume dictionary of the
German language.
The Grimm brothers also saw French domination
as a threat to German culture, and believed that
the folktales they had collected were expressions
of a pure and authentic German spirit. They
considered their projects of collecting folktales
and developing the German language as part of
the wider effort to oppose French domination
and create a German national identity.
The emphasis on vernacular language and the collection of local
folklore was not just to recover an ancient national spirit, but also to
carry the modern nationalist message to large audiences who were
mostly illiterate. This was especially so in the case of Poland, which
had been partitioned at the end of the eighteenth century by the
Great Powers – Russia, Prussia and Austria. Even though Poland no
longer existed as an independent territory, national feelings were kept
alive through music and language. Karol Kurpinski, for example,
celebrated the national struggle through his operas and music, turning
folk dances like the polonaise and mazurka into nationalist symbols.
Language too played an important role in developing nationalist
sentiments. After Russian occupation, the Polish language was forced
out of schools and the Russian language was imposed everywhere.
In 1831, an armed rebellion against Russian rule took place which
was ultimately crushed. Following this, many members of the clergy
in Poland began to use language as a weapon of national resistance.
Polish was used for Church gatherings and all religious instruction.
As a result, a large number of priests and bishops were put in jail or
sent to Siberia by the Russian authorities as punishment for their
refusal to preach in Russian. The use of Polish came to be seen as a
symbol of the struggle against Russian dominance.
3.2 Hunger, Hardship and Popular Revolt
The 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. The
first half of the nineteenth century saw an enormous increase in
population all over Europe. In most countries there were more
seekers of jobs than employment. Population from rural areas
migrated to the cities to live in overcrowded slums. Small producers
in towns were often faced with stiff competition from imports of
cheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialisation
was more advanced than on the continent. This was especially so in
textile production, which was carried out mainly in homes or small
workshops and was only partly mechanised. In those regions of
Europe where the aristocracy still enjoyed power, peasants struggled
under the burden of feudal dues and obligations. The rise of food
prices or a year of bad harvest led to widespread pauperism in
town and country.
The year 1848 was one such year. Food shortages and widespread
unemployment brought the population of Paris out on the roads.
Barricades were erected and Louis Philippe was forced to flee. A

National Assembly proclaimed a Republic, granted suffrage to all
adult males above 21, and guaranteed the right to work. National
workshops to provide employment were set up.
Earlier, in 1845, weavers in Silesia had led a revolt against contractors
who supplied them raw material and gave them orders for finished
textiles but drastically reduced their payments. The journalist Wilhelm
Wolff described the events in a Silesian village as follows:
In these villages (with 18,000 inhabitants) cotton weaving is the
most widespread occupation … The misery of the workers is
extreme. The desperate need for jobs has been taken advantage
of by the contractors to reduce the prices of the goods they
order …
On 4 June at 2 p.m. a large crowd of weavers emerged from
their homes and marched in pairs up to the mansion of their
contractor demanding higher wages. They were treated with
scorn and threats alternately. Following this, a group of them
forced their way into the house, smashed its elegant window-
panes, furniture, porcelain … another group broke into the
storehouse and plundered it of supplies of cloth which they
tore to shreds … The contractor fled with his family to a
neighbouring village which, however, refused to shelter such a
person. He returned 24 hours later having requisitioned the army.
In the exchange that followed, eleven weavers were shot.

Nationalism   in   Europe
3.3 1848: The Revolution of the Liberals
Parallel to the revolts of the poor, unemployed and starving peasants
and workers in many European countries in the year 1848, a revolution
led by the educated middle classes was under way. Events of February
1848 in France had brought about the abdication of the monarch
and a republic based on universal male suffrage had been proclaimed.
In other parts of Europe where independent nation-states did not
yet exist – such as Germany, Italy, Poland, the Austro-Hungarian
Empire – men and women of the liberal middle classes combined
their demands for constitutionalism with national unification. They
took advantage of the growing popular unrest to push their
demands for the creation of a nation-state on parliamentary
principles – a constitution, freedom of the press and freedom
of association.
In the German regions a large number of political associations whose
members were middle-class professionals, businessmen and
prosperous artisans came together in the city of Frankfurt and decided
to vote for an all-German National Assembly. On 18 May 1848,
831 elected representatives marched in a festive procession to take
their places in the Frankfurt parliament convened in the Church of
St Paul. They drafted a constitution for a German nation to be
headed by a monarchy subject to a parliament. When the deputies
offered the crown on these terms to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of
Prussia, he rejected it and joined other monarchs to oppose the
elected assembly. While the opposition of the aristocracy and military
became stronger, the social basis of parliament eroded. The
parliament was dominated by the middle classes who resisted the
demands of workers and artisans and consequently lost their support.
In the end troops were called in and the assembly was forced
to disband.
The issue of extending political rights to women was a controversial
one within the liberal movement, in which large numbers of women
had participated actively over the years. Women had formed their
own political associations, founded newspapers and taken part in
political meetings and demonstrations. Despite this they were denied
How were liberty and equality for women
to be defined?
The liberal politician Carl Welcker, an elected
member of the Frankfurt Parliament, expressed
the following views:
‘Nature has created men and women to carry
out different functions … Man, the stronger, the
bolder and freer of the two, has been designated
as protector of the family, its provider, meant for
public tasks in the domain of law, production,
defence. Woman, the weaker, dependent and
timid, requires the protection of man. Her sphere
is the home, the care of the children, the
nurturing of the family … Do we require any
further proof that given such differences, equality
between the sexes would only endanger
harmony and destroy the dignity of the family?’
Louise Otto-Peters (1819-95) was a political
activist who founded a women’s journal and
subsequently a feminist political association. The
first issue of her newspaper (21 April 1849) carried
the following editorial:
‘Let us ask how many men, possessed by
thoughts of living and dying for the sake of Liberty,
would be prepared to fight for the freedom of
the entire people, of all human beings? When
asked this question, they would all too easily
respond with a “Yes!”, though their untiring
efforts are intended for the benefit of only one
half of humanity – men. But Liberty is indivisible!
Free men therefore must not tolerate to be
surrounded by the unfree …’
An anonymous reader of the same newspaper
sent the following letter to the editor on 25 June
1850:
‘It is indeed ridiculous and unreasonable to deny
women political rights even though they enjoy
the right to property which they make use
of. They perform functions and assume
responsibilities without however getting the
benefits that accrue to men for the same … Why
this injustice? Is it not a disgrace that even the
stupidest cattle-herder possesses the right
to vote, simply because he is a man, whereas
highly talented women owning considerable
property are excluded from this right, even
though they contribute so much to the
maintenance of the state?’ Source

Though conservative forces were able to suppress liberal movements
in 1848, they could not restore the old order. Monarchs were
beginning to realise that the cycles of revolution and repression could
only be ended by granting concessions to the liberal-nationalist
revolutionaries. Hence, in the years after 1848, the autocratic
monarchies of Central and Eastern Europe began to introduce the
changes that had already taken place in Western Europe before 1815.
Thus serfdom and bonded labour were abolished both in the
Habsburg dominions and in Russia. The Habsburg rulers granted
more autonomy to the Hungarians in 1867.

Nationalism   in   Europe
4  The Making of Germany and Italy
4.1 Germany – Can the Army be the Architect of a Nation?
After 1848, nationalism in Europe moved away from its association
with democracy and revolution. Nationalist sentiments were often
mobilised by conservatives for promoting state power and achieving
political domination over Europe.
This can be observed in the process by which Germany and Italy came
to be unified as nation-states. As you have seen, nationalist feelings were
widespread among middle-class Germans, who in 1848 tried to unite
the different regions of the German confederation into a nation-state
governed by an elected parliament. This liberal initiative to nation-building
was, however, repressed by the combined forces of the monarchy and
the military, supported by the large landowners (called Junkers) of Prussia.
From then on, Prussia took on the leadership of the movement for
national unification. Its chief minister, Otto von
Bismarck, was the architect of this process carried
out with the help of the Prussian army and
bureaucracy. Three wars over seven years – with
Austria, Denmark and France – ended in Prussian
victory and completed the process of unification.
In January 1871, the Prussian king, William I,
was proclaimed German Emperor in a ceremony
held at Versailles.
On the bitterly cold morning of 18 January 1871,
an assembly comprising the princes of the
German states, representatives of the army,
important Prussian ministers including the chief
minister Otto von Bismarck gathered in the
unheated Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles
to proclaim the new German Empire headed
by Kaiser William I of Prussia.
The nation-building process in Germany had
demonstrated the dominance of Prussian state
power. The new state placed a strong emphasis
on modernising the currency, banking, legal
and judicial systems in Germany. Prussian
measures and practices often became a model for
the rest of Germany.

4.2 Italy Unified
Like Germany, Italy too had a long history of political fragmentation.
Italians were scattered over several dynastic states as well as the
multi-national Habsburg Empire. During the middle of the
nineteenth century, Italy was divided into seven states, of which
only one, Sardinia-Piedmont, was ruled by an Italian princely house.
The north was under Austrian Habsburgs, the centre was ruled by
the Pope and the southern regions were under the domination
of the Bourbon kings of Spain. Even the Italian language had
not acquired one common form and still had many regional and
local variations.
During the 1830s, Giuseppe Mazzini had sought to put together a
coherent programme for a unitary Italian Republic. He had also
formed a secret society called Young Italy for the dissemination of
his goals. The failure of revolutionary uprisings both in 1831 and
1848 meant that the mantle now fell on Sardinia-Piedmont under
its ruler King Victor Emmanuel II to unify the Italian states through
war. In the eyes of the ruling elites of this region, a unified
Italy offered them the possibility of economic development and
political dominance.

Chief Minister Cavour who led the movement to unify the regions
of Italy was neither a revolutionary nor a democrat. Like many
other wealthy and educated members of the Italian elite, he spoke
French much better than he did Italian. Through a tactful diplomatic
alliance with France engineered by Cavour, Sardinia-Piedmont
succeeded in defeating the Austrian forces in 1859. Apart from regular
troops, a large number of armed volunteers under the leadership of
Giuseppe Garibaldi joined the fray. In 1860, they marched into South
Italy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and succeeded in winning
the support of the local peasants in order to drive out the Spanish
rulers. In 1861 Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed king of united
Italy. However, much of the Italian population, among whom rates
of illiteracy were very high, remained blissfully unaware of liberal-
nationalist ideology. The peasant masses who had supported Garibaldi
in southern Italy had never heard of Italia, and believed that ‘La  Talia’
was Victor Emmanuel’s wife!

was not the result of a sudden upheaval or revolution. It was the
result of a long-drawn-out process. There was no British nation
prior to the eighteenth century. The primary identities of the people
who inhabited the British Isles were ethnic ones – such as English,
Welsh, Scot or Irish. All of these ethnic groups had their own cultural
and political traditions. But as the English nation steadily grew in
wealth, importance and power, it was able to extend its influence
over the other nations of the islands. The English parliament, which
had seized power from the monarchy in 1688 at the end of a
protracted conflict, was the instrument through which a nation-state,
with England at its centre, came to be forged. The Act of Union
(1707) between England and Scotland that resulted in the formation
of the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain’ meant, in effect, that
England was able to impose its influence on Scotland. The British
parliament was henceforth dominated by its English members. The
growth of a British identity meant that Scotland’s distinctive culture
and political institutions were systematically suppressed. The Catholic
clans that inhabited the Scottish Highlands suffered terrible repression
whenever they attempted to assert their independence. The Scottish
Highlanders were forbidden to speak their Gaelic language or
wear their national dress, and large numbers were forcibly driven
out of their homeland.
Ireland suffered a similar fate. It was a country deeply divided
between Catholics and Protestants. The English helped the Protestants
of Ireland to establish their dominance over a largely Catholic country.
Catholic revolts against British dominance were suppressed. After a
failed revolt led by Wolfe Tone and his United Irishmen (1798),
Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1801.
A new ‘British nation’ was forged through the propagation of a
dominant English culture. The symbols of the new Britain – the
British flag (Union Jack), the national anthem (God Save Our Noble
King), the English language – were actively promoted and the older
nations survived only as subordinate partners in this union.

Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-82) is perhaps the
most celebrated of Italian freedom fighters. He
came from a family engaged in coastal trade and
was a sailor in the merchant navy. In 1833 he
met Mazzini, joined the Young Italy movement
and participated in a republican uprising in
Piedmont in 1834. The uprising was suppressed
and Garibaldi had to flee to South America, where
he lived in exile till 1848. In 1854, he supported
Victor Emmanuel II in his efforts to unify the
Italian states. In 1860, Garibaldi led the famous
Expedition of the Thousand to South Italy. Fresh
volunteers kept joining through the course of
the campaign, till their numbers grew to about
30,000. They were popularly known as Red
Shirts.
In 1867, Garibaldi led an army of volunteers to
Rome to fight the last obstacle to the unification
of Italy, the Papal States where a French garrison
was stationed. The Red Shirts proved to be no
match for the combined French and Papal troops.
It was only in 1870 when, during the war with
Prussia, France withdrew its troops from Rome
that the Papal States were finally joined
to Italy.

5  Visualising the Nation
While it is easy enough to represent a ruler through a portrait or a
statue, how does one go about giving a face to a nation? Artists in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries found a way out by
personifying a nation. In other words they represented a country as
if it were a person. Nations were then portrayed as female figures.
The female form that was chosen to personify the nation did not
stand for any particular woman in real life; rather it sought to give
the abstract idea of the nation a concrete form. That is, the female
figure became an allegory of the nation.
You will recall that during the French Revolution artists used the
female allegory to portray ideas such as Liberty, Justice and the
Republic. These ideals were represented through specific objects or
symbols.  As you would remember, the attributes of Liberty are the
red cap, or the broken chain, while Justice is generally a blindfolded
woman carrying a pair of weighing scales.
Similar female allegories were invented by artists in the nineteenth
century to represent the nation. In France she was christened
Marianne, a popular Christian name, which underlined the idea of a
people’s nation. Her characteristics were drawn from those of Liberty
and the Republic – the red cap, the tricolour, the cockade. Statues
of Marianne were erected in public squares to remind the public of
the national symbol of unity and to persuade them to identify with
it. Marianne images were marked on coins and stamps.
Similarly, Germania became the allegory of the German nation. In
visual representations, Germania wears a crown of oak leaves, as
the German oak stands for heroism.

6  Nationalism and Imperialism
By the last quarter of the nineteenth century nationalism no longer
retained its idealistic liberal-democratic sentiment of the first half
of the century, but became a narrow creed with limited ends. During
this period nationalist groups became increasingly intolerant of each
other and ever ready to go to war. The major European powers, in
turn, manipulated the nationalist aspirations of the subject peoples
in Europe to further their own imperialist aims.
The most serious source of nationalist tension in Europe after 1871
was the area called the Balkans. The Balkans was a region of
geographical and ethnic variation comprising modern-day Romania,
Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro whose inhabitants were broadly
known as the Slavs. A large part of the Balkans was under the control
of the Ottoman Empire. The spread of the ideas of romantic
nationalism in the Balkans together with the disintegration of the
Ottoman Empire made this region very explosive. All through the
nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire had sought to strengthen
itself through modernisation and internal reforms but with very
little success. One by one, its European subject nationalities broke
away from its control and declared independence. The Balkan
peoples based their claims for independence or political rights on
nationality and used history to prove that they had once been
independent but had subsequently been subjugated by foreign
powers. Hence the rebellious nationalities in the Balkans thought of
their struggles as attempts to win back their long-lost independence.
 As the different Slavic nationalities struggled to define their identity
and independence, the Balkan area became an area of intense conflict.
The Balkan states were fiercely jealous of each other and each hoped
to gain more territory at the expense of the others. Matters were
further complicated because the Balkans also became the scene of
big power rivalry. During this period, there was intense rivalry among
the European powers over trade and colonies as well as naval and
military might. These rivalries were very evident in the way the Balkan
problem unfolded. Each power – Russia, Germany, England,
Austro-Hungary – was keen on countering the hold of other powers
over the Balkans, and extending its own control over the area. This
led to a series of wars in the region and finally the First World War.

Nationalism   in   Europe
Nationalism, aligned with imperialism, led Europe to disaster in 1914.
But meanwhile, many countries in the world which had been
colonised by the European powers in the nineteenth century began
to oppose imperial domination. The anti-imperial movements that
developed everywhere were nationalist, in the sense that they all
struggled to form independent nation-states, and were inspired by
a sense of collective national unity, forged in confrontation with
imperialism. European ideas of nationalism were nowhere
replicated, for people everywhere developed their own specific variety
of nationalism. But the idea that societies should be organised into
‘nation-states’ came to be accepted as natural and universal.

Nationalism  in  India
As you have seen, modern nationalism in Europe came to be
associated with the formation of nation-states. It also meant a change
in people’s understanding of who they were, and what defined their
identity and sense of belonging. New symbols and icons, new songs
and ideas forged new links and redefined the boundaries of
communities. In most countries the making of this new national
identity was a long process. How did this consciousness emerge
in India?
In India and as in  many other colonies, the growth of modern
nationalism is intimately connected to the anti-colonial movement.
People began discovering their unity in the process of their struggle
with colonialism. The sense of being oppressed under colonialism
provided a shared bond that tied many different groups together.
But each class and group felt the effects of colonialism differently,
their experiences were varied, and their notions of freedom were
not always the same.  The Congress under Mahatma Gandhi tried
to forge these groups together within one movement. But the unity
did not emerge without conflict.
In an earlier textbook you have read about the growth of nationalism
in India up to the first decade of the twentieth century. In this chapter
we will pick up the story from the 1920s and study the Non-
Cooperation and Civil Disobedience Movements. We will explore
how the Congress sought to develop the national movement, how
different social groups participated in the movement, and how
nationalism captured the imagination of people.

1  The First World War, Khilafat and Non-Cooperation
In the years after 1919, we see the national movement spreading to
new areas, incorporating new social groups, and developing new
modes of struggle. How do we understand these developments?
What implications did they have?
First of all, the war created a new economic and political situation.
It led to a huge increase in defence expenditure which was financed
by war loans and increasing taxes: customs duties were raised and
income tax introduced. Through the war years prices increased –
doubling between 1913 and 1918 –  leading to extreme hardship
for the common people. Villages were called upon to supply soldiers,
and the forced recruitment in rural areas caused widespread anger.
Then in 1918-19 and 1920-21, crops failed in many parts of India,
resulting in acute shortages of food. This was accompanied by an
influenza epidemic. According to the census of 1921, 12 to 13 million
people perished as a result of famines and  the epidemic.
People hoped that their hardships would end after the war was
over. But that did not happen.
At this stage a new leader appeared and suggested a new mode
of struggle.

the racist regime with a novel method of mass agitation, which he
called satyagraha. The idea of satyagraha emphasised the power of
truth and the need to search for truth. It suggested that if the cause
was true, if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force was
not necessary to fight the oppressor. Without seeking vengeance or
being aggressive, a satyagrahi could win the battle through non-
violence. This could be done by  appealing to the conscience of the
oppressor. People – including the oppressors – had to be persuaded
to see the truth, instead of being forced to accept truth through the
use of violence. By this struggle, truth was bound to ultimately
triumph. Mahatma Gandhi believed that this dharma of non-violence
could unite all Indians.
After arriving in India, Mahatma Gandhi successfully organised
satyagraha movements in various places. In 1917 he travelled to
Champaran in  Bihar to inspire the peasants to struggle against the
oppressive plantation system. Then in 1917,  he organised a satyagraha
to support the peasants of the Kheda district of Gujarat. Affected
by crop failure and a plague epidemic, the peasants of Kheda could
not pay the revenue, and were demanding that revenue collection be
relaxed. In 1918, Mahatma Gandhi went to Ahmedabad to organise
a satyagraha movement amongst cotton mill workers.
1.2 The Rowlatt Act
Emboldened with this success, Gandhiji in 1919 decided to launch a
nationwide satyagraha against the proposed Rowlatt Act (1919). This
Act had been hurriedly passed through the Imperial Legislative
Council despite the united opposition of the Indian members. It
gave the government enormous powers to repress political activities,
and allowed detention of political prisoners without trial for two
years. Mahatma Gandhi wanted non-violent civil disobedience against
such unjust laws, which would start with a hartal on 6 April.
Rallies were organised in various cities, workers went on strike in
railway workshops, and shops closed down. Alarmed by the popular
upsurge, and scared that lines of communication such as the railways
and telegraph would be disrupted, the British administration decided
to clamp down on nationalists. Local leaders were picked up from
Amritsar, and Mahatma Gandhi was barred from entering Delhi.
On 10 April, the police in Amritsar fired upon a peaceful procession,
provoking widespread attacks on banks, post offices and railway
stations. Martial law was imposed and General Dyer took command.
Mahatma Gandhi on Satyagraha
‘It is said of “passive resistance” that it is the
weapon of the weak, but the power which is
the subject of this article can be used only
by the strong. This power is not passive
resistance; indeed it calls for intense activity. The
movement in South Africa was not passive
but active  …
‘ Satyagraha is not physical force. A satyagrahi
does not inflict pain on the adversary; he does
not seek his destruction … In the use of
satyagraha, there is no ill-will whatever.
‘ Satyagraha is pure soul-force. Truth is the very
substance of the soul. That is why this force is
called satyagraha. The soul is informed with
knowledge. In it burns the flame of love. … Non-
violence is the supreme dharma …
‘It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or
Europe in force of arms. The British worship the
war-god and they can all of them become, as
they are becoming, bearers of arms. The
hundreds of millions in India can never carry arms.
They have made the religion of non-violence their
own ...’

On 13 April the infamous Jallianwalla Bagh incident took place. On
that day a large crowd gathered in the enclosed ground of Jallianwalla
Bagh. Some came to protest against the government’s new repressive
measures. Others had come to attend the annual Baisakhi fair.  Being
from outside the city, many villagers were unaware of the martial
law that had been imposed. Dyer entered the area, blocked the exit
points, and opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds. His object,
as he declared later, was to ‘produce a moral effect’, to create in the
minds of satyagrahis a feeling of terror and awe.
As the news of Jallianwalla Bagh spread, crowds took to the streets
in many north Indian towns. There were strikes, clashes with the
police and attacks on government buildings. The government
responded with brutal repression, seeking to humiliate and terrorise
people: satyagrahis were forced to rub their noses on the ground,
crawl on the streets, and do salaam (salute) to all sahibs; people were
flogged and villages (around Gujranwala in Punjab, now in Pakistan)
were bombed. Seeing violence spread, Mahatma Gandhi called off
the movement.
While the Rowlatt satyagraha had been a widespread movement, it
was still limited mostly to cities and towns. Mahatma Gandhi now felt
the need to launch a more broad-based movement in India.  But he
was certain that no such movement could be organised without
bringing the Hindus and Muslims closer together. One way of doing
this, he felt, was to take up the Khilafat issue. The First World War had
ended with the defeat of Ottoman Turkey. And there were rumours
that a harsh peace treaty was going to be imposed on the Ottoman
emperor –  the spiritual head of the Islamic world (the Khalifa). To
defend the Khalifa’s temporal powers, a Khilafat Committee was
formed in Bombay in March 1919. A young generation of Muslim
leaders like the brothers Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, began
discussing with Mahatma Gandhi about the possibility of a united
mass action on the issue. Gandhiji saw this as an opportunity to bring
Muslims under the umbrella of a unified national movement. At the
Calcutta session of the Congress in September 1920, he convinced
other leaders of the need to start a non-cooperation movement in
support of Khilafat as well as for swaraj.
1.3  Why Non-cooperation?
In his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909) Mahatma Gandhi declared
that British rule was established in India with the cooperation of

Nationalism  in  India
New words
Boycott – The refusal to deal and associate with
people, or participate in activities, or buy and
use things; usually a form of protest
Indians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians
refused to cooperate, British rule in India would collapse within a
year, and swaraj would come.
How could non-cooperation become a movement? Gandhiji
proposed that the movement should unfold in stages. It should begin
with the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a
boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils,
schools, and foreign goods. Then, in case the government used
repression, a full civil disobedience campaign would be launched.
Through the summer of 1920 Mahatma Gandhi and Shaukat Ali
toured extensively, mobilising popular support for the movement.
Many within the Congress were, however, concerned about the
proposals. They were reluctant to boycott the council elections
scheduled for November 1920, and they feared that the movement
might lead to popular violence.  In the months between September
and December there was an intense tussle within the Congress. For a
while there seemed no meeting point between the supporters and
the opponents of the movement. Finally, at the Congress session at
Nagpur in December 1920, a compromise was worked out and
the Non-Cooperation programme was adopted.
How did the movement unfold? Who participated in it? How did
different social groups conceive of the idea of Non-Cooperation?

2  Differing Strands within the Movement
The Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement began in January 1921.
Various social groups participated in this movement, each with its
own specific aspiration. All of them responded to the call of Swaraj,
but the term meant different things to different people.
2.1 The Movement in the Towns
The movement started with middle-class participation in the cities.
Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and
colleges, headmasters and teachers resigned, and lawyers gave up
their legal practices. The council elections were boycotted in most
provinces except Madras, where the Justice Party, the party of the
non-Brahmans, felt that entering the council was one way of gaining
some power – something that usually only Brahmans had access to.
The effects of non-cooperation on the economic front were more
dramatic. Foreign goods were boycotted, liquor shops picketed,
and foreign cloth burnt in huge bonfires. The import of foreign
cloth halved between 1921 and 1922, its value dropping from
Rs 102 crore to Rs 57 crore. In many places merchants and traders
refused to trade in foreign goods or finance foreign trade. As the
boycott movement spread, and people began discarding imported
clothes and wearing only Indian ones, production of Indian textile
mills and handlooms went up.
But this movement in the cities gradually slowed down for a variety
of reasons. Khadi cloth was often more expensive than mass-
produced mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it.
How then could they boycott mill cloth for too long? Similarly the
boycott of British institutions posed a problem. For the movement
to be successful, alternative Indian institutions had to be set up
so that they could be used in place of the British ones. These were
slow to come up. So students and teachers began trickling
back to government schools and lawyers joined back work in
government courts.
2.2 Rebellion in the Countryside
From the cities, the Non-Cooperation Movement spread to the
countryside. It drew into its fold the struggles of peasants and tribals

which were developing in different parts of India in the years
after the war.
In Awadh, peasants were led by Baba Ramchandra – a sanyasi who
had earlier been to Fiji as an indentured labourer. The movement
here was against talukdars and landlords who demanded from
peasants exorbitantly high rents and a variety of other cesses. Peasants
had to do begar and work at landlords’ farms without any payment.
As tenants they had no security of tenure, being regularly evicted so
that they could acquire no right over the leased land. The peasant
movement demanded reduction of revenue, abolition of begar, and
social boycott of oppressive landlords. In many places nai – dhobi
bandhs were organised by panchayats to deprive landlords of the
services of even barbers and washermen. In June 1920, Jawaharlal
Nehru began going around the villages in Awadh, talking to the
villagers, and trying to understand their grievances. By October, the
Oudh Kisan Sabha was set up headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, Baba
Ramchandra and a few others. Within a month, over 300 branches
had been set up in the villages around the region. So when the Non-
Cooperation Movement began the following year, the effort of the
Congress was to integrate the Awadh peasant struggle into the wider
struggle. The peasant movement, however, developed in forms that
the Congress leadership was unhappy with. As the movement spread
in 1921, the houses of talukdars and merchants were attacked,
bazaars were looted, and grain hoards were taken over. In many
places local leaders told peasants that Gandhiji had declared that
no taxes were to be paid and land was to be redistributed among
the poor. The name of the Mahatma was being invoked to sanction
all action and aspirations.

On 6 January 1921, the police in United Provinces fired at peasants near Rae Bareli. Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to go to
the place of firing, but was stopped by the police. Agitated and angry, Nehru addressed the peasants who gathered
around him. This is how he later described the meeting:
‘They behaved as brave men, calm and unruffled in the face of danger. I do not know how they felt but I know what
my feelings were. For a moment my blood was up, non-violence was almost forgotten – but for a moment only. The
thought of the great leader, who by God’s goodness has been sent to lead us to victory, came to me, and I saw the
kisans seated and standing near me, less excited, more peaceful than I was – and the moment of weakness passed, I
spoke to them in all humility on non-violence – I needed the lesson more than they – and they heeded me and
peacefully dispersed.’

Tribal peasants interpreted the message of Mahatma Gandhi and
the idea of swaraj in yet another way. In the Gudem Hills of Andhra
Pradesh, for instance, a militant guerrilla movement spread in
the early 1920s –  not a form of struggle that the Congress could
approve. Here, as in other forest regions, the colonial government
had closed large forest areas, preventing people from entering
the forests to graze their cattle, or to collect fuelwood and fruits.
This enraged the hill people. Not only were their livelihoods
affected but they felt that their traditional rights were being denied.
When the government began forcing them to contribute begar
for road building, the hill people revolted. The person who came
to lead them was an interesting figure. Alluri Sitaram Raju claimed
that he had a variety of special powers: he could make correct
astrological predictions and heal people, and he could survive
even bullet shots. Captivated by Raju, the rebels proclaimed that
he was an incarnation of God. Raju talked of the greatness of
Mahatma Gandhi, said he was inspired by the Non-Cooperation
Movement, and persuaded people to wear khadi and give up drinking.
But at the same time he asserted that India could be liberated only
by the use of force, not non-violence. The Gudem rebels attacked
police stations, attempted to kill British officials and carried on
guerrilla warfare for achieving swaraj.  Raju was captured and
executed in 1924, and over time became a folk hero.
2.3 Swaraj in the Plantations
Workers too had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi
and the notion of swaraj.  For plantation workers in Assam, freedom
meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in
which they were enclosed, and it meant retaining a link with the
village from which they had come. Under the Inland Emigration
Act of 1859, plantation workers were not permitted to leave the
tea gardens without permission, and in fact they were rarely given
such permission. When they heard of the Non-Cooperation
Movement, thousands of workers defied the authorities, left the
plantations and headed home. They believed that Gandhi Raj was
coming and everyone would be given land in their own villages.
They, however, never reached their destination. Stranded on the way
by a railway and steamer strike, they were caught by the police and
brutally beaten up.

The visions of these movements were not defined by the Congress
programme. They interpreted the term swaraj in their own ways,
imagining it to be a time when all suffering and all troubles would
be over. Yet, when the tribals chanted Gandhiji’s name and raised
slogans demanding ‘Swatantra Bharat’, they were also emotionally
relating to an all-India agitation. When they acted in the name of
Mahatma Gandhi, or linked their movement to that of the Congress,
they were identifying with a movement which went beyond the limits
of their immediate locality.

3  Towards Civil Disobedience
In February 1922, Mahatma Gandhi decided to withdraw the
Non-Cooperation Movement. He felt the movement was turning
violent in many places and satyagrahis needed to be properly trained
before they would be ready for mass struggles. Within the Congress,
some leaders were by now tired of mass struggles and wanted to
participate in elections to the provincial councils that had been set
up by the Government of India Act of 1919. They felt that it was
important to oppose British policies within the councils, argue for
reform and also demonstrate that these councils were not truly
democratic. C. R. Das and Motilal Nehru formed the Swaraj Party
within the Congress to argue for a return to council politics. But
younger leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose
pressed for more radical mass agitation and for full independence.
In such a situation of internal debate and dissension two factors
again shaped Indian politics towards the late 1920s. The first was
the effect of the worldwide economic depression. Agricultural prices
began to fall from 1926 and collapsed after 1930. As the demand
for agricultural goods fell and exports declined, peasants found it
difficult to sell their harvests and pay their revenue. By 1930, the
countryside was in turmoil.
Against this background the new Tory government in Britain
constituted a Statutory Commission under Sir John Simon. Set up
in response to the nationalist movement, the
commission was to look into the functioning of
the constitutional system in India and suggest
changes. The problem was that the commission
did not have a single Indian member. They were
all British.
When the Simon Commission arrived in India in
1928, it was greeted with the slogan ‘Go back
Simon’. All parties, including the Congress and the
Muslim League, participated in the demonstrations.
In an effort to win them over, the viceroy, Lord
Irwin, announced in October 1929, a vague offer
of ‘dominion status’ for India in an unspecified
future, and a Round Table Conference to discuss a
future constitution. This did not satisfy the Congress
leaders. The radicals within the Congress, led by

Nationalism  in  India
Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, became more assertive.
The liberals and moderates, who were proposing a constitutional
system within the framework of British dominion, gradually lost
their influence. In December 1929, under the presidency of Jawaharlal
Nehru, the Lahore Congress formalised the demand of ‘Purna
Swaraj’ or full independence for India. It was declared that 26 January
1930, would be celebrated as the Independence Day when people
were to take a pledge to struggle for complete independence. But
the celebrations attracted very little attention. So Mahatma Gandhi
had to find a way to relate this abstract idea of freedom to more
concrete issues of everyday life.
3.1 The Salt March and the Civil Disobedience Movement
Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite
the nation. On 31 January 1930, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin
stating eleven demands. Some of these were of general interest;
others were specific demands of different classes, from industrialists
to peasants. The idea was to make the demands wide-ranging, so
that all classes within Indian society could identify with them and
everyone could be brought together in a united campaign. The most
stirring of all was the demand to abolish the salt tax. Salt was
something consumed by the rich and the poor alike, and it was one
of the most essential items of food. The tax on salt and the
government monopoly over its production, Mahatma Gandhi
declared, revealed the most oppressive face of British rule.
Mahatma Gandhi’s letter was, in a way, an ultimatum. If the
demands were not fulfilled by 11 March, the letter stated, the
Congress would launch a civil disobedience campaign. Irwin was
unwilling to negotiate. So Mahatma Gandhi started his famous
salt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march
was over 240 miles, from Gandhiji’s ashram in Sabarmati to the
Gujarati coastal town of Dandi. The volunteers walked for 24 days,
about 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear Mahatma Gandhi
wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by swaraj
and urged them to peacefully defy the British. On 6 April he reached
Dandi, and ceremonially violated the law, manufacturing salt by
boiling sea water.
This marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
How was this movement different from the Non-Cooperation
Movement? People were now asked not only to refuse cooperation
The Independence Day Pledge, 26 January
1930
‘We believe that it is the inalienable right of the
Indian people, as of any other people, to have
freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and
have the necessities of life, so that they may
have full opportunities of growth. We believe
also that if any government deprives a people of
these rights and oppresses them, the people
have a further right to alter it or to abolish it.
The British Government in India has not only
deprived the Indian people of their freedom but
has based itself on the exploitation of the masses,
and has ruined India economically, politically,
culturally, and spiritually. We believe, therefore,
that India must sever the British connection and
attain Purna Swaraj or Complete Independence.’

with the British, as they had done in 1921-22, but also to break
colonial laws. Thousands in different parts of the country broke
the salt law, manufactured salt and demonstrated in front of
government salt factories. As the movement spread, foreign cloth
was boycotted, and liquor shops were picketed. Peasants refused to
pay revenue and chaukidari taxes, village officials resigned, and in
many places forest people violated forest laws – going into Reserved
Forests to collect wood and graze cattle.
Worried by the developments, the colonial government began
arresting the Congress leaders one by one. This led to violent clashes
in many palaces. When Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a devout disciple of
Mahatma Gandhi, was arrested in April 1930, angry crowds
demonstrated in the streets of Peshawar, facing armoured cars and
police firing. Many were killed. A month later, when Mahatma
Gandhi himself was arrested, industrial workers in Sholapur attacked
police posts, municipal buildings, lawcourts and railway stations –
all structures that symbolised British rule. A frightened government
responded with a policy of brutal repression. Peaceful satyagrahis
were attacked, women and children were beaten, and about 100,000
people were arrested.
In such a situation, Mahatma Gandhi once again decided to call off
the movement and entered into a pact with Irwin on 5 March 1931.
By this Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhiji consented to participate in a
Round Table Conference (the Congress had boycotted the first

Round Table Conference) in London and the government agreed to
release the political prisoners. In December 1931, Gandhiji went to
London for the conference, but the negotiations broke down and
he returned disappointed. Back in India, he discovered that the
government had begun a new cycle of repression. Ghaffar Khan
and Jawaharlal Nehru were both in jail, the Congress had been
declared illegal, and a series of measures had been imposed to prevent
meetings, demonstrations and boycotts. With great apprehension,
Mahatma Gandhi relaunched the Civil Disobedience Movement.
For over a year, the movement continued, but by 1934 it lost
its momentum.
3.2 How Participants saw the Movement
Let us now look at the different social groups that participated in the
Civil Disobedience Movement. Why did they join the movement?
What were their ideals? What did swaraj mean to them?
In the countryside, rich peasant communities – like the Patidars of
Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh – were active in the movement.
Being producers of commercial crops, they were very hard hit by
the trade depression and falling prices. As their cash income
disappeared, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue
demand. And the refusal of the government to reduce the revenue
demand led to widespread resentment. These rich peasants became
enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement,
organising their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members,
to participate in the boycott programmes. For them the fight for
swaraj was a struggle against high revenues. But they were deeply
disappointed when the movement was called off in 1931 without
the revenue rates being revised. So when the movement was restarted
in 1932, many of them refused to participate.
The poorer peasantry were not just interested in the lowering of the
revenue demand. Many of them were small tenants cultivating land
they had rented from landlords. As the Depression continued and
cash incomes dwindled, the small tenants found it difficult to pay
their rent. They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted.
They joined a variety of radical movements, often led by Socialists
and Communists. Apprehensive of raising issues that might upset
the rich peasants and landlords, the Congress was unwilling to support
‘no rent’ campaigns in most places. So the relationship between the
poor peasants and the Congress remained uncertain.
‘To the altar of this revolution we have
brought our youth as incense’
Many nationalists thought that the struggle
against the British could not be won through
non-violence. In 1928, the Hindustan Socialist
Republican Army (HSRA) was founded at a
meeting in Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi.
Amongst its leaders were Bhagat Singh, Jatin
Das and Ajoy Ghosh. In a series of dramatic
actions in different parts of India, the HSRA
targeted some of the symbols of British power.
In April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeswar
Dutta threw a bomb in the Legislative Assembly.
In the same year there was an attempt to blow
up the train that Lord Irwin was travelling in.
Bhagat Singh was 23 when he was tried and
executed by the colonial government. During
his trial, Bhagat Singh stated that he did not
wish to glorify ‘the cult of the bomb and pistol’
but wanted a revolution in society:
‘Revolution is the inalienable right of mankind.
Freedom is the imprescriptible birthright of all.
The labourer is the real sustainer of society …
To the altar of this revolution we have brought
our youth as incense, for no sacrifice is too
great for so magnificent a cause. We are
content. We await the advent of revolution.
Inquilab Zindabad!’

What about the business classes? How did they relate to the Civil
Disobedience Movement? During the First World War, Indian
merchants and industrialists had made huge profits and become
powerful (see Chapter 5). Keen on expanding their business, they
now reacted against colonial policies that restricted business activities.
They wanted protection against imports of foreign goods, and a
rupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio that would discourage imports.
To organise business interests, they formed the Indian Industrial
and Commercial Congress in 1920 and the Federation of the Indian
Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) in 1927. Led by
prominent industrialists like Purshottamdas Thakurdas and
G. D. Birla, the industrialists attacked colonial control over the Indian
economy, and supported the Civil Disobedience Movement when
it was first launched.  They gave financial assistance and refused to
buy or sell imported goods. Most businessmen came to see swaraj
as a time when colonial restrictions on business would no longer
exist and trade and industry would flourish without constraints. But
after the failure of the Round Table Conference, business groups
were no longer uniformly enthusiastic. They were apprehensive of
the spread of militant activities, and worried about prolonged
disruption of business, as well as of the growing influence of
socialism amongst the younger members of the Congress.
The industrial working classes did not participate in the Civil
Disobedience Movement in large numbers, except in the Nagpur
region. As the industrialists came closer to the Congress, workers
stayed aloof. But in spite of that, some workers did participate in
the Civil Disobedience Movement, selectively adopting some of
the ideas of the Gandhian programme, like boycott of foreign
goods, as part of their own movements against low wages and
poor working conditions. There were strikes by railway workers in
1930 and dockworkers in 1932. In 1930 thousands of workers in
Chotanagpur tin mines wore Gandhi caps and participated in protest
rallies and boycott campaigns. But the Congress was reluctant to
include workers’ demands as part of its programme of struggle.
It felt that this would alienate industrialists and divide the anti-
imperial forces.
Another important feature of the Civil Disobedience Movement
was the large-scale participation of women. During Gandhiji’s salt
march, thousands of women came out of their homes to listen to
him. They participated in protest marches, manufactured salt, and

picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops. Many went to jail. In urban
areas these women were from high-caste families; in rural areas
they came from rich peasant households. Moved by Gandhiji’s call,
they began to see service to the nation as a sacred duty of women.
Yet, this increased public role did not necessarily mean any radical
change in the way the position of women was visualised. Gandhiji
was convinced that it was the duty of women to look after home
and hearth, be good mothers and good wives. And for a long time
the Congress was reluctant to allow women to hold any position
of authority within the organisation. It was keen only on their
symbolic presence.
3.3 The Limits of Civil Disobedience
Not all social groups were moved by the abstract concept of swaraj.
One such group was the nation’s ‘untouchables’, who from around
the 1930s had begun to call themselves dalit or oppressed. For
long the Congress had ignored the dalits, for fear of offending the
sanatanis, the conservative high-caste Hindus. But Mahatma Gandhi
declared that swaraj would not come for a hundred years if
untouchability was not eliminated. He called the ‘untouchables’ harijan,

or the children of God, organised satyagraha to secure them
entry into temples, and access to public wells, tanks, roads and
schools. He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the
bhangi (the sweepers), and persuaded upper castes to change
their heart and give up ‘the sin of untouchability’. But many
dalit leaders were keen on a different political solution to the
problems of the community. They began organising themselves,
demanding reserved seats in educational institutions, and a
separate electorate that would choose dalit members for
legislative councils. Political empowerment, they believed, would
resolve the problems of their social disabilities. Dalit
participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was therefore
limited, particularly in the Maharashtra and Nagpur region
where their organisation was quite strong.
Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the
Depressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma
Gandhi at the second Round Table Conference by demanding
separate electorates for dalits. When the British government
conceded Ambedkar’s demand, Gandhiji began a fast unto
death. He believed that separate electorates for dalits would
slow down the process of their integration into society.
Ambedkar ultimately accepted Gandhiji’s position and the
result was the Poona Pact of September 1932. It gave the
Depressed Classes (later to be known as the Schedule Castes)
reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils,
but they were to be voted in by the general electorate. The
dalit movement, however, continued to be apprehensive of
the Congress-led national movement.
Some of the Muslim political organisations in India were also
lukewarm in their response to the Civil Disobedience
Movement. After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat
Movement, a large section of Muslims felt alienated from the
Congress. From the mid-1920s the Congress came to be more
visibly associated with openly Hindu religious nationalist groups
like the Hindu Mahasabha. As relations between Hindus and
Muslims worsened, each community organised religious
processions with militant fervour, provoking Hindu-Muslim
communal clashes and riots in various cities. Every riot deepened
the distance between the two communities.
The Congress and the Muslim League made efforts to renegotiate
an alliance, and in 1927 it appeared that such a unity could be forged.
The important differences were over the question of representation
in the future assemblies that were to be elected. Muhammad Ali

Nationalism  in  India
Jinnah, one of the leaders of the Muslim League, was willing to give
up the demand for separate electorates, if Muslims were assured
reserved seats in the Central Assembly and representation in
proportion to population in the Muslim-dominated provinces (Bengal
and Punjab). Negotiations over the question of representation
continued but all hope of resolving the issue at the All Parties
Conference in 1928 disappeared when M.R. Jayakar of the Hindu
Mahasabha strongly opposed efforts at compromise.
When the Civil Disobedience Movement started there was thus
an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust between communities.
Alienated from the Congress, large sections of Muslims could not
respond to the call for a united struggle. Many Muslim leaders and
intellectuals expressed their concern about the status of Muslims
as a minority within India. They feared that the culture and identity
of minorities would be submerged under the domination of a
Hindu majority.
In 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, as president of the Muslim League, reiterated the importance of separate electorates for
the Muslims as an important safeguard for their minority political interests. His statement is supposed to have provided the
intellectual justification for the Pakistan demand that came up in subsequent years. This is what he said:
‘I have no hesitation in declaring that if the principle that the Indian Muslim is entitled to full and free development on the
lines of his own culture and tradition in his own Indian home-lands is recognised as the basis of a permanent communal
settlement, he will be ready to stake his all for the freedom of India. The principle that each group is entitled to free
development on its own lines is not inspired by any feeling of narrow communalism … A community which is inspired by
feelings of ill-will towards other communities is low and ignoble. I entertain the highest respect for the customs, laws,
religions and social institutions of other communities. Nay, it is my duty according to the teachings of the Quran, even to
defend their places of worship, if need be. Yet I love the communal group which is the source of life and behaviour and
which has formed me what I am by giving me its religion, its literature, its thought, its culture and thereby its whole past
as a living operative factor in my present consciousness …
‘Communalism in its higher aspect, then, is indispensable to the formation of a harmonious whole in a country like India.
The units of Indian society are not territorial as in European countries … The principle of European democracy cannot be
applied to India without recognising the fact of communal groups. The Muslim demand for the creation of a Muslim India
within India is, therefore, perfectly justified…
‘The Hindu thinks that separate electorates are contrary to the spirit of true nationalism, because he understands the
word “nation” to mean a kind of universal amalgamation in which no communal entity ought to retain its private individuality.
Such a state of things, however, does not exist. India is a land of racial and religious variety. Add to this the general
economic inferiority of the Muslims, their enormous debt, especially in the Punjab, and their insufficient majorities in some
of the provinces, as at present constituted and you will begin to see clearly the meaning of our anxiety to retain separate
electorates.’

4  The Sense of Collective Belonging
Nationalism spreads when people begin to believe that they are all
part of the same  nation, when they discover some unity that binds
them together. But how did the nation become a reality in the minds
of people? How did people belonging to different communities,
regions or language groups develop a sense of collective belonging?
This sense of collective belonging came partly through the experience
of united struggles. But there were also a variety of cultural processes
through which nationalism captured people’s imagination. History
and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols, all played
a part in the making of nationalism.

Nationalism  in  India
The identity of the nation, as you know (see Chapter 1), is most
often symbolised in a figure or image. This helps create an image
with which people can identify the nation. It was in the twentieth
century, with the growth of nationalism, that the identity of India
came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata. The
image was first created by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. In the
1870s he wrote ‘Vande Mataram’ as a hymn to the motherland.
Later it was included in his novel Anandamath and widely sung during
the Swadeshi movement in Bengal. Moved by the Swadeshi
movement, Abanindranath Tagore painted his famous image of
Bharat Mata (see Fig. 12). In this painting Bharat Mata is portrayed
as an ascetic figure; she is calm, composed, divine and spiritual.
In subsequent years, the image of Bharat Mata acquired many
different forms, as it circulated in popular prints, and was painted
by different artists (see Fig. 14). Devotion to this mother figure came
to be seen as evidence of one’s nationalism.
Ideas of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive
Indian folklore.  In late-nineteenth-century India, nationalists began
recording folk tales sung by bards and they toured villages to gather
folk songs and legends. These tales, they believed, gave a true picture
of traditional culture that had been corrupted and damaged by
outside forces. It was essential to preserve this folk tradition  in
order to discover one’s national identity and restore a sense of pride
in one’s past. In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore himself began collecting
ballads, nursery rhymes and myths, and led the movement for folk

Notice that the mother figure here is shown as
dispensing learning, food and clothing. The mala

Abanindranath Tagore, like Ravi Varma before
him, tried to develop a style of painting that
could be seen as truly Indian.

‘In earlier times, foreign travellers in India marvelled at the courage, truthfulness and modesty of the people of the Arya

hoist their flags in Tartar, China and other countries; now a few soldiers from a tiny island far away are lording it over the

revival. In Madras, Natesa Sastri published a massive four-volume
collection of Tamil folk tales, The Folklore of  Southern India. He believed
that folklore was national literature; it was ‘the most trustworthy
manifestation of people’s real thoughts and characteristics’.
As the national movement developed, nationalist leaders became
more and more aware of such icons and symbols in unifying people
and inspiring in them a feeling of nationalism. During the Swadeshi
movement in Bengal, a tricolour flag (red, green and yellow) was
designed. It had eight lotuses representing eight provinces of British
India, and a crescent moon, representing Hindus and Muslims. By
1921, Gandhiji had designed the Swaraj flag. It was again a tricolour
(red, green and white) and had a spinning wheel in the centre,
representing the Gandhian ideal of self-help. Carrying the flag,
holding it aloft, during marches became a symbol of defiance.
Another means of creating a feeling of nationalism was through
reinterpretation of history. By the end of the nineteenth century
many Indians began feeling that to instill a sense of pride in the
nation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British
saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing
themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to
discover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious
developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science
and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts
and trade had flourished. This glorious time, in their view, was
followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These
nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great
achievements in the past and struggle to change the miserable
conditions of life under British rule.
These efforts to unify people were not without problems. When the
past being glorified was Hindu, when the images celebrated were
drawn from Hindu iconography, then people of other communities
felt left out.

Nationalism  in  India
Conclusion
A growing anger against the colonial government was thus
bringing together various groups and classes of Indians into a
common struggle for freedom in the first half of the twentieth
century. The Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi
tried to channel people’s grievances into organised movements
for independence. Through such movements the nationalists
tried to forge a national unity. But as we have seen, diverse groups
and classes participated in these movements with varied aspirations
and expectations. As their
grievances were wide-ranging,
freedom from colonial rule also
meant different things to
different people. The Congress
continuously attempted to
resolve differences, and ensure
that the demands of one group
did not alienate another. This is
precisely why the unity within
the movement often broke down.
The high points of Congress
activity and nationalist unity
were followed by phases of
disunity and inner conflict
between groups.
In other words, what was emerging was a nation with many
voices wanting freedom from colonial rule.
Quit India Movement
The failure of the Cripps Mission and the effects of World War II created widespread discontentment in India. This
led Gandhiji to launch a movement calling for complete withdrawal of the British from India. The Congress Working
Committee, in its meeting in Wardha on 14 July 1942, passed the historic ‘Quit India’ resolution demanding the
immediate transfer of power to Indians and quit India. On 8 August 1942 in Bombay, the All India Congress Committee
endorsed the resolution which called for a non-violent mass struggle on the widest possible scale throughout the
country. It was on this occasion that Gandhiji delivered the famous ‘Do or Die’ speech. The call for ‘Quit India’ almost
brought the state machinery to a standstill in large parts of the country as people voluntarily threw themselves into
the thick of the movement. People observed hartals, and demonstrations and processions were accompanied by
national songs and slogans. The movement was truly a mass movement which brought into its ambit thousands of
ordinary people, namely students, workers and peasants. It also saw the active participation of leaders, namely,
Jayprakash Narayan, Aruna Asaf Ali and Ram Manohar Lohia and many women such as Matangini Hazra in Bengal,
Kanaklata Barua in Assam and Rama Devi in Odisha. The British responded with much force, yet it took more than a
year to suppress the movement.

Power-sharing
Overview
With this chapter, we resume the tour of democracy that we started last 
year. We noted last year that in a democracy all power does not rest 
with any one organ of the government. An intelligent sharing of power 
among legislature, executive and judiciary is very important to the design 
of a democracy. In this and the next two chapters, we carry this idea of 
power-sharing forward. We start with two stories from Belgium and Sri 
Lanka. Both these stories are about how democracies handle demands for 
power-sharing. The stories yield some general conclusions about the need 
for power-sharing in democracy.  This allows us to discuss various forms 
of power-sharing that will be taken up in the following two chapters.

I have a simple 
equation in mind. 
Sharing power = 
dividing power = 
weakening the 
country. Why do we 
start by talking of 
this?
Ethnic:  A social 
division based on 
shared culture. People 
belonging to the same 
ethnic group believe in 
their common descent 
because of similarities 
of physical type or of 
culture or both. They 
need not always have 
the same religion or 
nationality.
Belgium is a small country in Europe, 
smaller in area than the state of 
Haryana. It has borders with France, 
the Netherlands, Germany and 
Luxembourg. It has a population of 
a little over one crore, about half the 
population of Haryana. The ethnic 
composition of this small country is 
very complex. Of the country’s total 
population, 59 per cent lives in the 
Flemish region and speaks Dutch 
language. Another 40 per cent people 
live in the Wallonia region and speak 
French. Remaining one per cent of 
the Belgians speak German. In the 
capital city Brussels, 80 per cent 
people speak French while 20 per 
cent are Dutch-speaking.
The minority French-speaking 
community was relatively rich and 
powerful. This was resented by the 
Dutch-speaking community who got 
the benefit of economic development 
and education much later. This led 
to tensions between the Dutch-
speaking and French-speaking 
communities during the 1950s and 
1960s. The tension between the 
two communities was more acute 
in Brussels. Brussels presented a 
special problem: the Dutch-speaking 
people constituted a majority in 
the country, but a minority in the 
capital. 
Let us compare this to the 
situation in another country. Sri 
Lanka is an island nation, just a few 
kilometres off the southern coast 
of Tamil Nadu. It has about two 
crore people, about the same as in 
Haryana. Like other nations in the 
South Asia region, Sri Lanka has a 
diverse population. The major social 
groups are the Sinhala-speakers (74 
per cent) and the Tamil-speakers (18 
per cent). Among Tamils there are 
two sub-groups. Tamil natives of 
the country are called ‘Sri Lankan

Tamils’ (13 per  cent). The rest, 
whose forefathers came from India as 
plantation workers during colonial 
period, are called ‘Indian Tamils’. 
As you can see from the map,  Sri 
Lankan Tamils are concentrated in 
the north and east of the country. 
Most of the Sinhala-speaking people 
are Buddhists, while most of the 
Tamils are Hindus or Muslims. There 
are about 7 per cent Christians, who 
are both Tamil and Sinhala. 
Just imagine what could happen 
in situations like this. In Belgium, 
the Dutch community could take 
advantage of its numeric majority 
and force its will on the French and 
German-speaking population. This 
would push the conflict among 
communities further. This could 
lead to a very messy partition of the 
country; both the sides would claim 
control over Brussels. In Sri Lanka, 
the Sinhala community enjoyed 
an even bigger majority and could 
impose its will on the entire country. 
Now, let us look at what happened 
in both these countries.
Majoritarianism in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka emerged as an independent 
country in 1948. The leaders of 
the Sinhala community sought to 
secure dominance over government 
by virtue of their majority. As a 
result, the democratically elected 
government adopted a series of 
majoritarian measures to establish 
Sinhala supremacy.
In 1956, an Act was passed 
to recognise Sinhala as the only 
official language, thus disregarding 
Tamil. The governments followed 
preferential policies that favoured 
Sinhala applicants for university 
positions and government jobs. A 
new constitution stipulated that 
the state shall protect and foster 
Buddhism.
All these government measures, 
coming one after the other, gradually 
increased the feeling of alienation 
among the Sri Lankan Tamils. 
They felt that none of the major 
political parties led by the Buddhist 
Sinhala leaders was sensitive to their 
language and culture. They felt that 
the constitution and government 
policies denied them equal political 
rights, discriminated against them in 
getting jobs and other opportunities 
and ignored their interests. As a

What kind of a solution 
is this? I am glad our 
Constitution does not say

The Belgian leaders took a different 
path. They recognised the existence 
of regional differences and cultural 
diversities. Between 1970 and 1993, 
they amended their constitution four 
times so as to work out an arrangement 
that would enable everyone to live 
together within the same country.

different from any other country and is

The Sri Lankan Tamils launched 
parties and struggles for the recognition 
of Tamil as an official language, for 
regional autonomy and equality of 
opportunity in securing education 
and jobs. But their demand for more 
autonomy to provinces populated by the 
Tamils was repeatedly denied. By 1980s, 
several political organisations were 
formed demanding an independent 
Tamil Eelam (state) in northern and 
eastern parts of Sri Lanka. 
The distrust between the two 
communities turned into widespread 
conflict. It soon turned into a civil 
war. As a result thousands of people 
of both the communities have been 
killed. Many families were forced to 
leave the country as refugees and many 
more lost their livelihoods. The civil

So you are 
saying that 
sharing of power 
makes us more 
powerful. Sounds 
odd! Let me 
think.
What do we learn from these two 
stories of Belgium and Sri Lanka? 
Both are democracies. Yet, they 
dealt with the question of power 
sharing differently. In Belgium, 
the leaders have realised that the 
unity of the country is possible 
only by respecting the feelings and 
interests of different communities 
and regions. Such a realisation 
resulted in mutually acceptable 
arrangements for sharing power. 
Sri Lanka shows us a contrasting 
example. It shows us that if a 
majority community wants to 
force its dominance over others 
and refuses to share power, it can 
undermine the unity of the country.

	 Find out the cause of each of these conflicts. How many of these

	 Which of these conflicts could be resolved by working out power 
sharing arrangements?
European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium
accepted equal representation in the 
Central Government.
	 Apart from the Central and 
the State Government, there is a 
third kind of government. This 
‘community government’ is elected 
by people belonging to one language 
community – Dutch, French and 
German-speaking – no matter where 
they live. This government has the 
power regarding cultural, educational 
and language-related issues.
You might find the Belgian model 
very complicated. It indeed is very 
complicated, even for people living 
in Belgium. But these arrangements 
have worked well so far. They helped 
to avoid civic strife between the two 
major communities and a possible 
division of the country on linguistic 
lines. When many countries of

All the students in her school are Tamil-speaking and they

	 If the parents of Annette and Selvi were to approach 
respective governments to realise the desire of the child 
who is more likely to succeed? And why? 
Why power sharing is desirable?
Thus, two different sets of reasons can 
be given in favour of power sharing. 
Firstly, power sharing is good because 
it helps to reduce the possibility of 
conflict between social groups. Since 
social conflict often leads to violence 
and political instability, power sharing 
is a good way to ensure the stability 
of political order. Imposing the will 
of majority community over others 
may look like an attractive option in 
the short run, but in the long run it 
undermines the unity of the nation. 
Tyranny of the majority is not just 
oppressive for the minority; it often 
affects majority adversely as well. 
There is a second, deeper reason 
why power sharing is good for 
democracies. Power sharing is 
the very spirit of democracy. A 
democratic rule involves sharing 
power with those affected by its 
exercise, and who have to live with 
its effects. People have a right to be 
consulted on how they are to be 
governed. A legitimate government 
is one where citizens, through 
participation, acquire a stake in 
the system. 
Let us call the first set of reasons 
prudential and the second moral. 
While prudential reasons stress 
that power sharing will bring out 
better outcomes, moral reasons 
emphasise the very act of power 
sharing as valuable.
Prudential: Based on 
prudence, or on careful 
calculation of gains 
and losses. Prudential 
decisions are usually 
contrasted with decisions 
based purely on moral 
considerations.

problems of running the Germany’s grand

had to form a coalition government

majority of seats on their own in the 2005

As usual, Vikram was driving the motorbike under a vow 
of silence and Vetal was the pillion rider.  As usual, Vetal 
started telling Vikram a story to keep him awake while 
driving. This time the story went as follows:
“In the city of Beirut, there lived a man called Khalil. His 
parents came from different communities.  His father was an Orthodox Christian and 
mother a Sunni Muslim. This was not so uncommon in this modern, cosmopolitan 
city. People from various communities that lived in Lebanon came to live in its 
capital, Beirut. They lived together, intermingled, yet fought a bitter civil war among 
themselves. One of Khalil’s uncles was killed in that war.
At the end of this civil war, Lebanon’s leaders came together and agreed to some basic 
rules for power sharing among different communities. As per these rules, the country’s 
President must belong to the Maronite sect of Catholic Christians. The Prime Minister 
must be from the Sunni Muslim community. The post of Deputy Prime Minister is fixed 
for Orthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for Shi’a Muslims. Under this pact, 
the Christians agreed not to seek French protection and the Muslims agreed not to seek 
unification with the neighbouring state of Syria.When the Christians and Muslims came 
to this agreement, they were nearly equal in population. Both sides have continued to 
respect this agreement though now the Muslims are in clear majority. 
Khalil does not like this system one bit. He is a popular man with political ambition. 
But under the present system, the top position is out of his reach. He does not practise 
either his father’s or his mother’s religion and does not wish to be known by either. He 
cannot understand why Lebanon can’t be like any other ‘normal’ democracy. “Just hold 
an election, allow everyone to contest and whoever wins maximum votes becomes the 
president, no matter which community he comes from. Why can’t we do that, like in 
other democracies of the world?” he asks. His elders, who have seen the bloodshed of 
the civil war, tell him that the present system is the best guarantee for peace…”
The story was not finished, but they had reached the TV tower 
where they stopped every day. Vetal wrapped up quickly

power should be distributed among 
as many citizens as possible.
In modern democracies, power 
sharing arrangements can take many 
forms. Let us look at some of the 
most common arrangements that we 
have or will come across.
 1	 Power is shared among different 
organs of government, such as the 
legislature, executive and judiciary. 
Let us call this horizontal distribution 
of power because it allows different 
organs of government placed at 
the same level to exercise different 
powers. Such a separation ensures 
that none of the organs can exercise 
unlimited power. Each organ checks 
the others. This results in a balance 
of power among various institutions. 
Last year, we studied that in a 
democracy, even though ministers 
and government officials exercise 
power, they are responsible to the 
Parliament or State Assemblies. 
Similarly, although judges are 
appointed by the executive, they can 
check the functioning of executive or 
laws made by the legislatures. This 
arrangement is called a system of 
checks and balances.
 2	 Power can be shared among 
governments at different levels – 
a general government for the entire 
country and governments at the 
provincial or regional level. Such a 
general government for the entire 
country is usually called federal 
government. In India, we refer to it as 
the Central or Union Government. 
The governments at the provincial or 
regional level are called by different 
names in different countries. 
The idea of power-sharing has 
emerged in opposition to the notions 
of undivided political power. For a 
long time, it was believed that all 
power of a government must reside 
in one person or group of persons 
located at one place. It was felt that 
if the power to decide is dispersed, 
it would not be possible to take 
quick decisions and to enforce them. 
But these notions have changed 
with the emergence of democracy. 
One basic principle of democracy 
is that people are the source of all 
political power. In a democracy, 
people rule themselves through 
institutions of self-government. In 
a good democratic government, due 
respect is given to diverse groups 
and views that exist in a society. 
Everyone has a voice in the shaping 
of public policies. Therefore, it 
follows that in a democracy, political

In India, we call them State 
Governments. This system is not 
followed in all countries. There are 
many countries where there are no 
provincial or state governments. 
But in those countries like ours, 
where there are different levels 
of government, the constitution 
clearly lays down the powers of 
different levels of government. This 
is what they did in Belgium, but was 
refused in Sri Lanka. This is called 
federal division of power. The same 
principle can be extended to levels 
of government lower than the State 
government, such as the municipality 
and panchayat. Let us call division of 
powers involving higher and lower 
levels of government vertical division 
of power. We shall study these at 
some length in the next chapter.
 3	 Power may also be shared 
among different social groups, 
such as the religious and linguistic 
groups. ‘Community government’ 
in Belgium is a good example of this 
arrangement. In some countries, 
there are constitutional and legal 
arrangements, whereby socially 
weaker sections and women are 
represented in the legislatures 
and administration. Last year, we 
studied the system of ‘reserved 
constituencies’ in assemblies and 
the parliament of our country. This 
type of arrangement is meant to 
give space in the government and 
administration to diverse social

groups, who otherwise, would feel 
alienated from the government. This 
method is used to give minority 
communities a fair share in power. In 
Unit II, we shall look at various ways 
of accommodating social diversities.
4	 Power sharing arrangements 
can also be seen in the way political 
parties, pressure groups and 
movements control or influence 
those in power. In a democracy, 
the citizens must have freedom to 
choose among various contenders 
for power. In contemporary 
democracies, this takes the form 
of competition among different 
parties. Such competition ensures 
that power does not remain in 
one hand. In the long run, power 
is shared among different political 
parties that represent different 
ideologies and social groups. 
Sometimes this kind of sharing can 
be direct, when two or more parties 
form an alliance to contest elections. 
If their alliance is elected, they form 
a coalition government and thus 
share power. In a democracy, we 
find interest groups, such as those of 
traders, businessmen, industrialists, 
farmers and industrial workers. 
They also will have a share in 
governmental power, either through 
participation in governmental 
committees or bringing influence on 
the decision-making process. In Unit 
III, we shall study the working of  
political parties.

Chapter 2
Federalism
Overview
In the previous chapter, we noted that vertical division of power among 
different levels of government is one of the major forms of power-sharing 
in modern democracies. In this chapter, we focus on this form of power-
sharing. It is most commonly referred to as federalism. We begin by 
describing federalism in general terms. The rest of the chapter tries to 
understand the theory and practice of federalism in India. A discussion 
of the federal constitutional provisions is followed by an analysis of the 
policies and politics that has strengthened federalism in practice. Towards 
the end of the chapter, we turn to the local government, a new and third 
tier of Indian federalism.

Let us get back to the contrast 
between Belgium and Sri Lanka 
that we saw in the last chapter. You 
would recall that one of the key 
changes made in the Constitution 
of Belgium was to reduce the 
power of the Central Government 
and to give these powers to the 
regional 
governments. 
Regional 
governments existed in Belgium 
even earlier. They had their roles 
and powers. But all these powers 
were given to these governments 
and could be withdrawn by the 
Central Government. The change 
that took place in 1993 was that the 
regional governments were given 
constitutional powers that were 
no longer dependent on the central 
government. Thus, Belgium shifted 
from a unitary to a federal form of 
government. Sri Lanka continues 
to be, for all practical purposes, a 
unitary system where the national 
government has all the powers. 
Tamil leaders want Sri Lanka to 
become a federal system.
Federalism is a system of 
government in which the power is 
divided between a central authority 
and various constituent units of the 
country. Usually, a federation has 
two levels of government. One is the 
government for the entire country 
that is usually responsible for a 
few subjects of common national 
interest. The  others are governments 
at the level of provinces or states 
that look after much of the day-
to-day administering of their state. 
Both these levels of governments 
enjoy their power independent of 
the other.

7 	 The federal system thus has dual 
objectives: to safeguard and promote 
unity of the country, while at the 
same time accommodate regional 
diversity. Therefore, two aspects 
are crucial for the institutions and 
practice of federalism. Governments 
at different levels should agree to 
some rules of power-sharing. They 
should also trust that each would 
abide by its part of the agreement. 
An ideal federal system has both 
aspects : mutual trust and agreement 
to live together. 
The exact balance of power 
between the central and the state 
government 
varies 
from 
one 
federation to another.  This balance 
depends mainly on the historical 
context in which the federation was 
formed. There are two kinds of routes 
through which federations have been 
formed. The first route involves 
independent States coming together 
on their own to form a bigger unit, 
so that by pooling sovereignty and 
retaining identity, they can increase 
their security. This type of ‘coming 
together’ federations include the 
USA, Switzerland and Australia. In 
this first category of federations, all 
the constituent States usually have 
equal power and are strong vis-à-vis 
the federal government.
The second route is where a 
large country decides to divide its 
power between the constituent 
States and the national government. 
India, Spain and Belgium are 
examples of this kind of ‘holding 
together’ federations. In this second 
category, the Central Government 
tends to be more powerful vis-à-
vis the States. Very often different 
constituent units of the federation 
have unequal powers. Some units 
are granted special powers.
If federalism 
works only in 
big countries, 
why did Belgium 
adopt it?
Jurisdiction: The 
area over which 
someone has legal 
authority. The area 
may be defined in 
terms of geographical 
boundaries or in terms 
of certain kinds of 
subjects.
In this sense, federations are 
contrasted with unitary governments. 
Under the unitary system, either 
there is only one level of government 
or the sub-units are subordinate to 
the central government. The central 
government can pass on orders to the 
provincial or the local government. 
But in a federal system, the central 
government cannot order the state 
government to do something. State 
government has powers of its own 
for which it is not answerable 
to the central government. Both 
these governments are separately 
answerable to the people.
Let us look at some of the key 
features of federalism : 
1 	 There are two or more levels (or 
tiers) of government.
2 	 Different tiers of government 
govern the same citizens, but 
each tier has its own jurisdiction 
in specific matters of legislation, 
taxation and administration. 
3 	 The jurisdictions of the respective 
levels or tiers of government are 
specified in the constitution. So the 
existence and authority of each tier 
of government is constitutionally 
guaranteed. 
4 	 The fundamental provisions 
of the constitution cannot be 
unilaterally changed by one level of 
government. Such changes require 
the consent of both the levels of 
government.
5 	 Courts have the power to 
interpret 
the 
constitution 
and 
the powers of different levels of 
government. The highest court 
acts as an umpire if disputes arise  
between 
different 
levels 
of 
government in the exercise of their 
respective powers.
6 	 Sources of revenue for each level 
of government are clearly specified 
to ensure its financial autonomy.

Isn’t that 
strange? Did 
our constitution 
makers not 
know about 
federalism? Or 
did they wish 
to avoid talking 
about it? 
Some Nepalese citizens were discussing the proposals on the 
adoption of federalism in their new constitution. This is what some of 
them said:
Khag Raj: I don’t like federalism. It would lead to reservation of seats for 
different caste groups as in India. 
Sarita:  Ours in not a very big country. We don’t need federalism.
Babu Lal: I am hopeful that the Terai areas will get more autonomy if they get 
their own state government.
Ram Ganesh: I like federalism because it will mean that powers that were earlier 
enjoyed by the king will now be exercised by our elected representatives.
If you were participating in this conversation, what would be your response to each 
of these? Which of these reflect a wrong understanding of what federalism is?
What makes India a federal country?
We have earlier seen how small 
countries like Belgium and Sri Lanka 
face so many problems of managing 
diversity. What about a vast country 
like India, with so many languages, 
religions and regions? What are 
the power sharing arrangements in  
our country?
Let us begin with the Constitution. 
India had emerged as an independent 
nation after a painful and bloody 
partition. Soon after Independence, 
several princely states became a part 
of the country. The Constitution 
declared India as a Union of States. 
Although it did not use the word 
federation, the Indian Union is based 
on the principles of federalism. 
Let us go back to the seven 
features of federalism mentioned 
above. We can see that all these 
features apply to the provisions 
of the Indian Constitution. The 
Constitution originally provided 
for a two-tier system of government, 
the Union Government or what 
we call the Central Government, 
representing the Union of India 
and the State governments. Later, 
a third tier of federalism was added 
in the form of Panchayats and 
Municipalities. As in any federation, 
these different tiers enjoy separate 
jurisdiction.  The Constitution 
clearly provided a three-fold 
distribution of legislative powers 
between the Union Government 
and the State Governments. Thus, 
it contains three lists: 
	 Union List includes subjects 
of national importance, such as 
defence of the country, foreign 
affairs, banking, communications 
and currency. They are included 
in this list because we need a 
uniform policy on these matters 
throughout the country. The Union 
Government alone can make laws 
relating to the subjects mentioned 
in the Union List.
	 State List contains subjects 
of State and local importance, 
such as police, trade, commerce, 
agriculture and irrigation. The State 
Governments alone can make laws 
relating to the subjects mentioned 
in the State List.
	 Concurrent List includes 
subjects of common interest to 
both the Union Government as 
well as the State Governments, such

as education, forest, trade unions, 
marriage, adoption and succession. 
Both the Union as well as the State 
Governments can make laws on 
the subjects mentioned in this list. 
If their laws conflict with each 
other, the law made by the Union 
Government will prevail. 
What about subjects that do not 
fall in any of the three lists? Or subjects 
like computer software that came up 
after the constitution was made? 
According to our constitution, the 
Union Government has the power to 
legislate on these ‘residuary’ subjects. 
We noted above that most 
federations that are formed by 
‘holding together’ do not give equal 
power to its constituent units. Thus, 
all States in the Indian Union do not 
have identical powers. Some States 
enjoy a special status. States such 
as Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal 
Pradesh and Mizoram enjoy special 
powers under certain provisions of 
the Constitution of India (Article 
371) due to their peculiar social 
and historical circumstances. These 
special powers are especially enjoyed 
in relation to the protection of 
land rights of indigenous peoples, 
their culture and also preferential 
employment in government services.  
Indians who are not permanent 
residents of this State cannot buy 
land or house here. Similar special 
provisions exist for some other States 
of India as well.
Listen to one national and one regional news bulletin broadcast by All India 
Radio daily for one week. Make a list of news items related to government 
policies or decisions by classifying these into the following categories:
	 News items that relate only to the Central Government,
	 News items that relate only to your or any other State Government,
	 News items about the relationship between the Central and State Governments.
There are some units of the 
Indian Union which enjoy very little 
power. These are areas which are 
too small to become an independent 
State but which could not be merged 
with any of the existing States. 
These areas, like Chandigarh, or 
Lakshadweep or the capital city of 
Delhi, are called Union Territories. 
These territories do not have the 
powers of a State. The Central 
Government has special powers in 
running these areas.
This sharing of power between 
the Union Government and the State 
Governments is basic to the structure 
of the Constitution. It is not easy to 
make changes to this power sharing 
arrangement. The Parliament cannot 
on its own change this arrangement. 
Any change to it has to be first passed 
by both the Houses of Parliament 
with at least two-thirds majority. 
Then it has to be ratified by the 
legislatures of at least half of the 
total States. 
The judiciary plays an important 
role in overseeing the implementation 
of constitutional provisions and 
procedures. In case of any dispute 
about the division of powers, the 
High Courts and the Supreme Court 
make a decision. The Union and 
State Governments have the power 
to raise resources by levying taxes in 
order to carry on the government 
and the responsibilities assigned to 
each of them.

Constitutional provisions are 
necessary for the success of federalism 
but these are not sufficient. If the 
federal experiment has succeeded 
in India, it is not merely because of 
the clearly laid out constitutional 
provisions. The real success of 
federalism in India can be attributed 
to the nature of democratic politics 
in our country. This ensured that 
the spirit of federalism, respect 
for diversity and desire for living 
together became shared ideals in our 
country. Let us look at some of the 
major ways in which this happened.
Linguistic States
The creation of linguistic States 
was the first and a major test for 
democratic politics in our country.  
If you look at the political map of 
India when it began its journey as a 
democracy in 1947 and that of 2019, 
you will be surprised by the extent 
of the changes. Many old States have 
vanished and many new States have 
been created. Areas, boundaries 
and names of the States have been 
changed. 
In 1947, the boundaries of several 
old States of India were changed in 
order to create new States. This was 
done to ensure that people who 
spoke the same language lived in 
the same State. Some States were 
created not on the basis of language 
but to recognise differences based 
on culture, ethnicity or geography. 
These include States like Nagaland, 
Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.
 Has your village / town / city 
remained under the same State 
since Independence? If not, 
what was the name of the earlier 
State?
 Can you identify names of three 
States in 1947 that have been 
changed later?
 Identify any three States which 
have been carved out of  bigger 
States.

De moc ra tic  Polit ics
When the demand for the 
formation of States on the basis of 
language was raised, some national 
leaders feared that it would lead to 
the disintegration of the country. 
The Central Government resisted 
linguistic States for some time. 
But the experience has shown that 
the formation of linguistic States 
has actually made the country 
more united. It has also made 
administration easier.
Language policy
A second test for Indian federation is 
the language policy. Our Constitution 
did not give the status of national 
language to any one language. Hindi 
was identified as the official language. 
But Hindi is the mother tongue of 
only about 40 per cent of Indians. 
Therefore, there were many safeguards 
to protect other languages. Besides 
Hindi, there are 22 other languages 
recognised as Scheduled Languages 
by the Constitution. A candidate in 
an examination conducted for the 
Central Government positions may 
opt to take the examination in any 
of these languages. States too have 
their own official languages. Much 
of the government work takes 
place in the official language of the  
concerned State. 
Unlike Sri Lanka, the leaders 
of our country adopted a very 
cautious attitude in spreading the 
use of Hindi. According to the 
Constitution, the use of English 
for official purposes was to stop in 
1965. However, many non-Hindi 
speaking States demanded that the 
use of English  continue. In Tamil 
Nadu, this movement took a violent 
form. The Central Government 
responded by agreeing to continue 
the use of English along with Hindi 
for official purposes. Many critics 
think that this solution favoured the 
English-speaking elite. Promotion 
of Hindi continues to be the official 
policy of the Government of India. 
Promotion does not mean that the 
Central Government can impose 
Hindi on States where people speak 
a different language. The flexibility 
shown by Indian political leaders 
helped our country avoid the kind of 
situation that Sri Lanka finds itself in. 
Centre-State relations
Restructuring the Centre-State 
relations is one more way in which 
federalism has been strengthened 
in practice. How the constitutional 
arrangements for sharing power 
work in reality depends to a large 
extent on how the ruling parties and 
leaders follow these arrangements. 
For a long time, the same party 
ruled both at the Centre and in most 
of the States. This meant that the 
State Governments did not exercise 
their rights as autonomous federal 
units. As and when the ruling party 
at the State level was different, the 
parties that ruled at the Centre tried 
to undermine the power of the 
States.  In those days, the Central 
Government would often misuse 
the Constitution to dismiss the State 
Governments that were controlled 
by rival parties. This undermined 
the spirit of federalism. 
All this changed significantly 
after 1990. This period saw the 
rise of regional political parties in 
many States of the country. This 
was also the beginning of the era 
of coalition governments at the 
Centre. Since no single party got a 
clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the 
major national parties had to enter 
into an alliance with many parties 
including several regional parties to 
form a government at the Centre.  
Coalition government: 
A government formed 
by the coming together 
of at least two political 
parties. Usually 
partners in a coalition 
form a political alliance 
and adopt a common 
programme.

Perils of Running a Coalition Government
This led to a new culture of 
power sharing and respect for the 
autonomy of State Governments. 
This trend was supported by a 
major judgement of the Supreme 
Court that made it difficult for the 
Central Government to dismiss state 
governments in an arbitrary manner. 
Thus, federal power sharing is more 
effective today than it was in the 
early years after the Constitution 
came into force.

Linguistic diversity of India
How many languages do we have 
in India? The answer depends 
on how one counts it. The latest 
information that we have is from 
the Census of India held in 2011. 
This census recorded more than 
1300 distinct languages which 
people mentioned as their mother 
tongues. These languages were 
grouped together under some 
major languages. For example, 
languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, 
Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, 
Rajasthani and many others were 
grouped together under ‘Hindi’.  
Even after this grouping, 
the Census found 121 major 
languages. Of these, 22 
languages are now included in 
the Eighth Schedule of the Indian 
Constitution and are therefore 
called ‘Scheduled Languages’. 
Others are called  
‘non-Scheduled Languages’. In 
terms of languages, India is  
perhaps the most diverse country  
in the world.
A look at the enclosed table 
makes it clear that no one 
language is the mother tongue of 
the majority of our population.  
The largest language, Hindi, is the 
mother tongue of only about 44  
per cent Indians. If we add to that 
all those who knew Hindi as their 
second or third language, the total 
number was still less than 50 per 
cent in 2011. As for English, only 
0.02 per cent Indians recorded it 
as their mother tongue. Another 
11 per cent knew it as a second or 
third language. 
Read this table carefully, but 
you need not memorise it. Just do 
the following:
	 Make a bar or pie chart on 
the basis of this information.
	 Prepare a map of linguistic 
diversity of India by shading

We noted above that federal 
governments have two or more 
tiers of governments. We have 
so far discussed the two-tiers of 
government in our country. But 
a vast country like India cannot 
be run only through these 
two-tiers. States in India are as large as 
independent countries of Europe. In 
terms of population, Uttar Pradesh 
is bigger than Russia, Maharashtra 
is about as big as Germany. Many 
of these States are internally very 
diverse. There is thus a need for 
power sharing within these States. 
Federal power sharing in India needs 
another tier of  government, below 
that of the State governments. This 
is the rationale for decentralisation 
of power. Thus, resulted a third-
tier of government, called local 
government. 
When power is taken away from 
Central and State governments and 
given to local government, it is called 
decentralisation. The basic idea behind 
decentralisation is that there are a large 
number of problems and issues which 
are best settled at the local level. People 
have better knowledge of problems 
in their localities. They also have 
better ideas on where to spend money 
and how to manage things more 
efficiently. Besides, at the local level 
it is possible for the people to directly 
participate in decision making. This 
helps to inculcate a habit of democratic 
participation. Local government is the 
best way to realise  one  important 
principle of democracy, namely local 
self-government.
The need for decentralisation 
was recognised in our Constitution. 
Since then, there have been 
several attempts to decentralise

power to the level of villages and 
towns. Panchayats in villages and 
municipalities in urban areas were 
set up in all the States. But these 
were directly under the control of 
state governments. Elections to these 
local governments were not held 
regularly. Local governments did 
not have any powers or resources of 
their own. Thus, there was very little 
decentralisation in effective terms. 
A major step towards decentra-
lisation was taken in 1992. The 
Constitution was amended to make 
the third-tier of democracy more 
powerful and effective. 
	 Now it is constitutionally 
mandatory to hold regular elections 
to local government bodies. 
	 Seats are reserved in the elected 
bodies and the executive heads of 
these institutions for the Scheduled 
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other 
Backward Classes. 
	 At least one-third of all positions 
are reserved for women. 
	 An independent institution 
called the State Election Commission 
has been created in each State to 
conduct panchayat and municipal 
elections. 
	 The State governments are 
required to share some powers and 
revenue with local government 
bodies. The nature of sharing varies 
from State to State. 
Rural local government is 
popularly known by the name 
panchayati raj. Each village, or a 
group of villages in some States, has 
a gram panchayat. This is a council 
consisting of several ward members, 
often called panch, and a president 
or sarpanch. They are directly

elected by all the adult population 
living in that ward or village. It is 
the decision-making body for the 
entire village. The panchayat works 
under the overall supervision of the 
gram sabha. All the voters in the 
village are its members. It has to 
meet at least twice or thrice in a year 
to approve the annual budget of the 
gram panchayat and to review the 
performance of the gram panchayat. 
The local government structure 
goes right up to the district level. A 
few gram panchayats are grouped 
together to form what is usually 
called a panchayat samiti or block 
or mandal. The members of this 
representative body are elected by all 
the panchyat members in that area. 
All the panchayat samitis or mandals 
in a district together constitute 
the zilla (district) parishad. Most 
members of the zilla parishad are 
elected. Members of the Lok Sabha 
and MLAs of that district and some 
other officials of other district level 
bodies are also its members. Zilla 
parishad chairperson is the political 
head of the zilla parishad. 
Similarly, local government 
bodies exist for urban areas as 
well. Municipalities are set up in 
towns. Big cities are constituted 
into municipal corporations. Both 
municipalities and municipal 
corporations are controlled 
by elected bodies consisting of 
people’s representatives. Municipal 
chairperson is the political head of 
the municipality. In a municipal 
corporation, such an officer is called 
the mayor.

An experiment in Brazil
A city called Porto Alegre in Brazil has carried out an extraordinary  experiment 
in combining decentralisation with participative democracy. The city has set up 
a parallel organisation operating alongside the municipal council, enabling local 
inhabitants to take real decisions for their city. The nearly 13 lakh people in this 
city get to participate in making the budget for their own city. The city is divided 
into many sectors or what we call wards. Each sector has a meeting, like that of 
the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are 
some meetings to discuss issues that affect the entire city. Any citizen of the city 
can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these 
meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a final decision 
about it.
About 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year. 
This method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefit 
of the colonies where rich people live. Buses now run to the poor colonies and 
builders cannot evict slum-dwellers without resettling them. 
In our own country, a similar experiment has taken place in some areas in 
Kerala. Ordinary people have participated in making a plan for the development 
of their locality.

Gender, 
Religion and 
Caste 
Overview
The existence of social diversity does not threaten democracy. Political 
expression of social differences is possible and sometimes quite desirable 
in a democratic system. In this chapter we apply these ideas to the practice 
of democracy in India. We look at three kinds of social differences that 
can take the form of social divisions and inequalities. These are social 
differences based on gender, religion and caste. In each case we look at 
the nature of this division in India and how it gets expressed in politics. 
We also ask whether different expressions based on these differences are 
healthy or otherwise in a democracy.

Gender and politics
Let us begin with gender division. 
This is a form of hierarchical social 
division seen everywhere, but is 
rarely recognised in the study of 
politics. The gender division tends 
to be understood as natural and 
unchangeable. However, it is not 
based on biology but on social 
expectations and stereotypes.
Public/private division
Boys and girls are brought up to 
believe that the main responsibility 
of women is housework and bringing 
up children. This is reflected in a 
sexual division of labour in most 
families: women do all work inside 
the home such as cooking, cleaning, 
washing clothes, tailoring, looking 
after children, etc., and men do all 
the work outside the home. It is not 
that men cannot do housework; they 
simply think that it is for women to 
attend to these things. When these 
jobs are paid for, men are ready to 
take up these works. Most tailors or 
cooks in hotels are men. Similarly, 
it is not that women do not work 
outside their home. In villages, 
women fetch water, collect fuel and  
work in the fields. In urban areas, 
poor women work as domestic 
helper in middle class homes, while 
middle class women work in offices. 
In fact, the majority of women do 
some sort of paid work in addition 
to domestic labour. But their work 
is not valued and does not get 
recognition.
The result of this division of 
labour is that although women 
constitute half of the humanity, their 
role in public life, especially politics, 
is minimal in most societies. Earlier, 
only men were allowed to participate 
in public affairs, vote and contest 
for public offices. Gradually the 
gender issue was raised in politics. 
Women in different parts of the 
world organised and agitated for 
equal rights. There were agitations 
in different countries for the 
extension of voting rights to women.

cabinets are largely all-male even 
when a woman becomes the Chief 
Minister or the Prime Minister. 
One way to solve this problem is 
to make it legally binding to have a fair 
proportion of women in the elected 
bodies. This is what the Panchayati 
Raj has done in India. One-third of 
seats in local government bodies – in 
panchayats and municipalities – are 
now reserved for women. Now there 
are more than 10 lakh elected women 
representatives in rural and urban 
local bodies.
Women’s organizations and 
activists had been demanding a 
similar reservation of at least one-
third of seats in Lok Sabha and 
State Assemblies for women. A 
bill with this proposal was pending 
before the Parliament for many 
decades. In 2023, Nari shakti Vandan 
Adhiniyam (Womens’ Reservation 
Act, 2023) has been passed which 
will give 33 percent reservation of 
seats for women in Lok Sabha, State 
Legislative Assemblies and also Delhi 
Assembly.
Gender division is an example 
that some form of social division 
needs to be expressed in politics. This 
also shows that disadvantaged groups 
do benefit when social divisions 
become a political issue. Do you 
think that women could have made 
the gains we noted above if their 
unequal treatment was not raised in 
the political domain?

Religion, communalism and politics 
Let us now turn to a very different 
kind of social division, the division 
based on religious differences. 
This division is not as universal 
as gender, but religious diversity 
is fairly widespread in the world 
today. Many countries including 
India have in their population, 
followers of different religions. As 
we noticed in the case of Northern 
Ireland, even when most of the 
people belong to the same religion, 
there can be serious differences 
about the way people practice that 
religion. Unlike gender differences, 
the religious differences are often 
expressed in the field of politics.
Consider the following:
	 Gandhiji used to say that 
religion can never be separated 
from politics. What he meant by 
religion was not any particular 
religion like Hinduism or Islam 
but moral values that inform all 
religions. He believed that politics 
must be guided by ethics drawn 
from religion.
	 Human rights groups in our 
country have demanded that the 
Government should take special 
steps to prevent communal riots 
and protect religious minorities.
	 Women’s movement has argued 
that family laws of all religions 
discriminate against women. 
So they have demanded that 
government should change these 
laws to make them more equitable.
All these instances involve 
a relationship between religion

religious. 
Why should I 
bother about 
communalism 
and secularism?
and politics. But they do not 
seem very wrong or dangerous. 
Ideas, ideals and values drawn 
from different religions can and 
perhaps should play a role in 
politics. People should be able 
to express in politics their needs, 
interests and demands as a member 
of a religious community. Those 
who hold political power should 
sometimes be able to regulate the 
practice of religion so as to prevent 
discrimination and oppression. 
These political acts are not wrong 
as long as they treat every religion 
equally.
Communalism
The problem begins when religion 
is seen as the basis of the nation. 
The example of Northern Ireland 
in Chapter 3 shows the dangers of 
such an approach to nationalism. 
The problem becomes more acute 
when religion is expressed in 
politics in exclusive and partisan 
terms, when one religion and 
its followers are pitted against 
another. This happens when beliefs 
of one religion are presented as 
superior to those of other religions, 
when the demands of one religious 
group are formed in opposition to 
another and when state power is 
used to establish domination of one 
religious group over the rest. This 
manner of using religion in politics 
is communal politics. 
Communal politics is based 
on the idea that religion is the 
principal basis of social community. 
Communalism involves thinking 
Reprint 2025-26
Ge nde r , R elig io n and  C ast e 
37
along the following lines. The 
followers of a particular religion 
must belong to one community. 
Their fundamental interests are 
the same. Any difference that they 
may have is irrelevant or trivial 
for community life. It also follows 
that people who follow different 
religions cannot belong to the same 
social community. If the followers 
of different religions have some 
commonalities these are superficial 
and immaterial, their interests are 
bound to be different and involve 
a conflict. In its extreme form, 
communalism leads to the belief 
that people belonging to different 
religions cannot live as equal citizens  
within one nation. Either, one of 
them has to dominate the rest or 
they have to form different nations.
This belief is fundamentally 
flawed.  People of one religion 
do not have the same interests 
and aspirations in every context. 
Everyone has several other roles, 
positions and identities. There 
are many voices inside every 
community. All these voices have 
a right to be heard. Therefore any 
attempt to bring all followers of one 
religion together in context other 
than religion is bound to suppress 
many voices within that community. 
Communalism can take various 
forms in politics:
	 The most common expression 
of communalism is in everyday 
beliefs. These routinely involve 
religious prejudices, stereotypes of 
religious communities and belief in 
the superiority of one’s religion over 
other religions. This is so common 
Family laws: Those 
laws that deal with 
family related matters 
such as marriage, 
divorce, adoption, 
inheritance, etc. 
In our country, 
different family laws 
apply to followers of 
different religions.
that we often fail to notice it, even 
when we believe in it.
	 A communal mind often leads to a 
quest for political dominance of one’s 
own religious community. For those 
belonging to majority community, 
this takes the form of majoritarian 
dominance. For those belonging 
to the minority community, it can 
take the form of a desire to form a 
separate political unit.
	 Political mobilisation on 
religious lines is another frequent 
form of communalism. This involves 
the use of sacred symbols, religious 
leaders, emotional appeal and plain 
fear in order to bring the followers 
of one religion together in the 
political arena. In electoral politics, 
this often involves special appeal to 
the interests or emotions of voters of 
one religion in preference to others.
	 Sometimes communalism takes 
its most ugly form of communal 
violence, riots and massacre. India 
and Pakistan suffered some of the 
worst communal riots at the time of 
the Partition. The post-Independence 
period has also seen large scale 
communal violence. 
Secular state
Communalism was and continues 
to be one of the major challenges 
to democracy in our country. The 
makers of our Constitution were 
aware of this challenge. That is why, 
they chose the model of a secular 
state. This choice was reflected in 
several constitutional provisions that 
we studied last year:
	 There is no official religion for 
the Indian state. Unlike the status of 
Buddhism in Sri Lanka, that of Islam 
I often crack 
jokes about 
people from one 
religion. Does 
that make me 
communal?
Reprint 2025-26

De moc ra tic  Polit ics
in Pakistan and that of Christianity in 
England, our Constitution does not 
give a special status to any religion.
	 The Constitution provides to 
all individuals and communities 
freedom to profess, practice and 
propagate any religion, or not to 
follow any. 
The Constitution prohibits 
discrimination on grounds of 
religion.
  At the same time, the Constitution  
allows the state to intervene in 
the matters of religion in order to 
ensure equality within religious 
communities. For example, it bans 
untouchability.
Understood in this sense, 
secularism is not just an ideology of 
some parties or persons. This idea 
constitutes one of the foundations 
of our country. Communalism 
should not be seen as a threat to 
some people in India. It threatens 
the very idea of India. That is why 
communalism needs to be combated. 
A secular Constitution like ours 
is necessary but not sufficient to 
combat communalism. Communal 
prejudices and propaganda need to 
be countered in everyday life and 
religion- based mobilisation needs to 
be countered in the arena of politics.
Caste and politics 
We have seen two instances of the 
expression of social divisions in the 
arena of politics, one largely positive 
and the other largely negative. Let us 
turn to our final case, that of caste 
and politics, that has both positive 
and the negative aspects.
Caste inequalities
Unlike gender and religion, caste 
division is special to India. All societies 
have some kind of social inequality 
and some form of division of labour. 
In most societies, occupations are 
passed on from one generation to 
another. Caste system is an extreme 
form of this. What makes it different 
from other societies is that in this 
system, hereditary occupational 
division was sanctioned by rituals. 
Members of the same caste group 
were supposed to form a social 
community that practiced the same 
or similar occupation, married 
within the caste group and did 
not eat with members from other 
caste groups. 
Caste system was based on 
exclusion of and discrimination 
against the ‘outcaste’ groups. They 
were subjected to the inhuman 
practice of untouchability about 
which you have studied in Class 
IX. That is why political leaders 
and social reformers like Jotiba 
Phule, Gandhiji, B.R. Ambedkar 
and Periyar Ramaswami Naicker 
advocated and worked to establish 
a society in which caste inequalities 
are absent. 
Partly due to their efforts and 
partly due to other socio-economic  
changes, castes and caste system 
in modern India have undergone 
great changes. With economic 
d e v e l o p m e n t ,  l a r g e  s c a l e 
urbanisation, growth of literacy and 
education, occupational mobility 
and the weakening of the position 
of landlords in the villages, the old 
notions of caste hierarchy are 
breaking down. Now, most of the

Social and Religious Diversity of India
The Census of India records the religion of each and every Indian after every ten years. 
The person who fills the Census form visits every household and records the religion of 
each member of that household exactly the way each person describes it. If someone 
says she has ‘no religion’ or that he is an ‘atheist’, this is exactly how it is recorded. 
Thus we have reliable information on the proportion of different religious communities 
in the country and how it has changed over the years. The pie chart below presents 
the population proportion of six major religious communities in the country. Since 
Independence, the total population of each community has increased substantially but 
their proportion in the country’s population has not changed much. In percentage terms, 
the population of the Hindus, Jains and Christians has declined marginally since 1961. 
The proportion of Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist population has increased slightly. There is 
a common but mistaken impression that the proportion of the Muslims in the country’s 
population is going to overtake other religious communities. Expert estimates done for 
the Prime Minister’s High Level Committee (popularly known as Sachar Committee) 
show that the proportion of the Muslims is expected to go up a little, by about 3 to 4 
per cent, in the next 50 years. It proves that in overall terms, the population balance 
of different religious communities is not likely to change in a big way.
The same is true of the major caste groups. The Census of India counts two social 
groups: the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Both these broad groups 
include hundreds of castes or tribes whose names are listed in an official Schedule. 
Hence the prefix ‘Scheduled’ in their name. The Scheduled Castes, commonly known 
as Dalits, include those that were previously regarded as ‘outcaste’ in the Hindu social 
order and were subjected to exclusion and untouchability. The Scheduled Tribes, often 
referred to as Adivasis, include those communities that led a secluded life usually in hills 
and forests and did not interact much with the rest of society. In 2011, the Scheduled 
Castes were 16.6 per cent and the 
Scheduled Tribes were 8.6 per cent 
of the country’s population. 
The Census does not yet count the 
Other Backward Classes, the group 
we discussed in Class IX. Hence there 
are some differences about their 
proportion in the country’s population. 
The National Sample Survey of  
2004–05 estimates their population 
to be around 41 per cent. Thus the 
SC, ST and the OBC together account 
for about two-thirds of the country’s 
population and about three-fourths of 
the Hindu population.

times, in urban areas it does not 
matter much who is walking along 
next to us on a street or eating at 
the next table in a restaurant. The 
Constitution of India prohibited any 
caste-based discrimination and laid 
the foundations of policies to reverse 
the injustices of the caste system. If 
a person who lived a century ago 
were to return to India, she would 
be greatly surprised at the change 
that has come about in the country.
Yet caste has not disappeared 
from contemporary India. Some 
of the older aspects of caste have 
persisted. Even now most people 
marry within their own caste or 
tribe. Untouchability has not ended 
completely, despite constitutional 
prohibition. Effects of centuries 
of advantages and disadvantages 
continue to be felt today. The caste 
groups that had access to education 
under the old system have done very 
well in acquiring modern education 
as well. Those groups that did not 
have access to education or were 
prohibited from acquiring it have 
naturally lagged behind. That is why 
there is a disproportionately large 
presence of ‘upper caste’ among 
the urban middle classes in our 
country. Caste continues to be 
closely linked to economic status. 
(See Plus Box on Page 41.)
Caste in politics
As in the case of communalism, 
casteism is rooted in the belief 
that caste is the sole basis of social 
community. According to this way 
of thinking, people belonging to 
the same caste belong to a natural 
social community and have the 
same interests which they do not 
share with anyone from another 
caste. As we saw in the case of 
communalism, such a belief is not 
borne out by our experience. Caste 
is one aspect of our experience but it 
is not the only relevant or the most 
important aspect.
Caste can take various forms 
in politics:
	 When parties choose candidates 
in elections, they keep in mind the 
caste composition of the electorate 
and nominate candidates from 
different castes so as to muster 
necessary support to win elections. 
When governments are formed, 
political parties usually take care that 
representatives of different castes and 
tribes find a place in it.
	 Political parties and candidates 
in elections make appeals to caste 
sentiment to muster support. Some 
political parties are known to favour 
some castes and are seen as their 
representatives.
	 Universal adult franchise and 
the principle of one-person-one-vote 
Urbanisation: Shift 
of population from 
rural areas to urban 
areas.
Occupational 
mobility: Shift from 
one occupation to 
another, usually 
when a new 
generation takes up 
occupations other 
than those practiced 
by their ancestors.
Caste hierarchy: A 
ladder-like formation 
in which all the caste 
groups are placed 
from the ‘highest’ to 
the ‘lowest’ castes.
I don’t care what 
my caste is. Why 
are we discussing

caste?

Caste inequality today
Caste is an important source of economic inequality because it regulates 
access to resources of various kinds.  For example, in the past, the so-called 
‘untouchable’ castes were denied the right to own land, while only the so-called 
‘twice born’ castes had the right to education.  Although this kind of explicit and 
formalised inequality based on caste is now outlawed, the effects of centuries of 
accumulated advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt.  Moreover, new 
kinds of inequalities have also developed.
The relationship between caste and economic status has certainly changed a 
lot.  Today, it is possible to find very rich and very poor people in every caste, 
whether ‘low’ or ‘high’.  This was not true even twenty or thirty years ago – it 
was very rare indeed to find rich people among the ‘lowest’ castes. However, 
as this evidence from the National Sample Survey shows, caste continues to be 
very strongly linked to economic status in many important ways: 
	
The average economic status (measured by criteria like monthly 
consumption expenditure) of caste groups still follows the old hierarchy – 
the ‘upper’ castes are best off, the Dalits and Adivasis are worst off, and the 
backward classes are in between.   
	
Although every caste has some poor members, the proportion living in 
extreme poverty (below the official ‘poverty line’) is much higher for the lowest 
castes and much lower for the upper castes, with the backward classes once 
again in between.
	
Although every caste has some members who are rich, the upper castes are 
heavily over-represented among the rich while the lower castes are severely 
under-represented.

compelled political leaders to gear up 
to the task of mobilising and securing 
political support. It also brought new 
consciousness among the people of 
castes that were hitherto treated as 
inferior and low.
The focus on caste in politics 
can sometimes give an impression 
that elections are all about caste and 
nothing else. That is far from true. 
Just consider these:
	 No parliamentary constituency 
in the country has a clear majority 
of one single caste. So, every 
candidate and party needs to win the 
confidence of more than one caste 
and community to win elections.
	 No party wins the votes of all 
the voters of a caste or community. 
When people say that a caste is a 
‘vote bank’ of one party, it usually 
means that a large proportion of 
the voters from that caste vote for 
that party.
	 Many political parties may put 
up candidates from the same caste 
(if that caste is believed to dominate 
the electorate in a particular 
constituency). Some voters have 
more than one candidate from their 
caste while many voters have no 
candidate from their caste.
	 The ruling party and the sitting 
MP or MLA frequently lose elections 
in our country. That could not 
have happened if all castes and 
communities were frozen in their 
political preferences.
Clearly, while caste matters in 
electoral politics, so do many other 
factors. The voters have strong 
attachment to political parties which 
is often stronger than their attachment 
to their caste or community. People 
within the same caste or community 
have different interests depending 
on their economic condition. Rich 
and poor or men and women from 
the same caste often vote very 
differently. People’s assessment of 
the performance of the government 
and the popularity rating of the 
leaders matter and are often decisive 
in elections.
Politics in caste
We have so far looked at what caste 
does to politics. But it does not mean 
that there is only a one-way relation 
between caste and politics. Politics 
too influences the caste system and 
caste identities by bringing them 
into the political arena. Thus, it is 
not politics that gets caste-ridden, it

is the caste that gets politicised. This 
takes several forms:
	 Each caste group tries to become 
bigger by incorporating within it 
neighbouring castes or sub-castes 
which were earlier excluded from it.
	 Various caste groups are required 
to enter into a coalition with other 
castes or communities and thus enter 
into a dialogue and negotiation.
	 New kinds of caste groups 
have come up in the political arena 
like ‘backward’ and ‘forward’ 
caste groups.
Thus, caste plays different 
kinds of roles in politics. In some 
situations, expression of caste 
differences in politics gives many 
disadvantaged communities the 
space to demand their share of 
power. In this sense, caste politics 
has helped people from Dalits and 
OBC castes to gain better access to 
decision making. Several political 
and non-political organisations have 
been demanding and agitating for 
an end to discrimination against 
particular castes, for more dignity 
and more access to land, resources 
and opportunities. 
At the same time, exclusive 
attention to caste can produce 
negative results as well. As in the 
case of religion, politics based on 
caste identity alone is not very 
healthy in a democracy. It can 
divert attention from other pressing 
issues like poverty, development 
and corruption. In some cases, caste 
division leads to tensions, conflict 
and even violence.

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that 
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This 
principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which 
continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and 
community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify 
an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage 
rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different 
subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in 
the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National 
Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and 
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and 
to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given 
space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging 
with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed 
textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other 
resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative 
is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as 
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of 
functioning. Flexibility in the daily timetable is as necessary as rigour in 
implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching 
days is actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and 
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making 
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or 
boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular 
burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with 
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. 
The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority 
and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in 
small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. 
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) 
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee 
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory 
group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan. We also wish to thank 
the Chief Advisors for this book, Professors Yogendra Yadav and Suhas 
Palshikar along with Advisor for this book, Professor K. C. Suri for guiding 
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development 
of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. 
We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously

Rationalisation of Content  
in the Textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content 
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises 
upon reducing the content load and providing opportunities for 
experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the 
NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across 
all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT 
across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the 
following
•	
Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas 
in the same class
•	
Similar content included in the lower or higher class  
in the same subject
•	
High difficulty level
•	
Content, which is easily accessible to students without much 
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children 
through self-learning or peer-learning.
•	
Content, which is not relevant in the present context or outdated.
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the 
changes given above.

A Letter for You
Dear students, teachers and parents,
Political Science textbooks for Class IX and Class X together form an 
integrated whole. That is why we called them Democratic Politics-I and 
Democratic Politics-II. This book begins where the Political Science textbook 
stopped last year in Class IX. Last year, the tour of democracy introduced you 
mainly to some basic ideas, institutions and rules of democracy. This year, the 
focus shifts from the institutions to the process. The book introduces you to 
how democracy works in practice and what can be expected of it. 
As a result of this shift, you would read much more directly about politics in 
this book. Politics is about how thinking human beings determine and change the 
way they live together. This involves ideas and ideals, cooperation and coordination. 
This also involves conflict and competition, self and collective interest. Therefore 
much of democratic politics is about power sharing. 
This forms the subject matter of the first four chapters in this book. In these 
chapters, we explore various forms of sharing and shaping of power in a democracy. 
Chapters One and Two constitute the first unit that presents the idea of power 
sharing and elaborates it in the context of power sharing between different levels of 
government. The second unit is about power sharing and accommodation among 
different social groups. The next chapter tells us how different political organisations 
and movements are important in democratic politics. The fifth chapter takes up the 
larger questions with which we began our tour last year. Thus, what democracies 
have achieved and what is yet to be achieved is discussed in the fifth chapter on 
outcomes. Thus ends the tour of democracy we began last year. As we travel through 
the different chapters, the meaning of democracy expands.
This book is a continuation of the Class IX textbook in another sense as well. 
Last year, the textbook had introduced a different style and form. Since we have had 
a very positive feedback from many of you regarding these features, we continue 
the experiment this year as well. This book also interacts with the students with the 
help of stories, illustrations, puzzles and cartoons. This time we have increased the 
visual elements and introduced a new feature called ‘Plus Box’. Do read about all the 
old and new features in the ‘How to Use this Book’. Above all, this book does not 
seek to teach and preach about democracy. It seeks to engage in a conversation with 
you. You would agree that this is a democratic way of thinking about democracy.
We were fortunate this year as well that some of the leading political scientists 
of the country agreed to join the Textbook Development Committee. We would 
like to express our deep appreciation of the support we received in preparing this 
textbook from Professor Krishna Kumar and Professor Hari Vasudevan and the 
advice received from the National Monitoring Committee. We would like to thank 
Professor Satish Deshpande for reading specific chapters and giving comments. A 
group of teachers and educationists comprising Anuradha Sen, Suman Lata, Manish

Jain, Radhika Menon, Malini Ghose, Alex M. George and Pankaj Pushkar read the 
drafts and made valuable suggestions. We would like to make a special mention of the 
untiring efforts of Alex and Pankaj, the two ‘super advisors’ of this book, to ensure 
that what is presented in the book was accurate, interesting and communicative. 
Parthiv Shah and Shroboni gave the book its attractive look. Irfan Khan once again 
created new-look Unni and Munni for you. Ahmed Raza of ARK Grafix provided 
with informative and appealing graphics and maps. We are highly thankful to the 
Lokniti and Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) for providing a 
congenial home for the textbook development committee, for sparing space and 
resources for this enterprise during the last two years.
At the end of this academic year, you will be taking the Board examinations. 
We wish you all the best in your examinations. We wish and hope that the tour 
of democracy undertaken in these two books will help you overcome two most 
common reactions: that Political Science is boring and that politics is disgusting. 
We hope you will continue to take interest in a critical and balanced understanding 
of democratic politics either by opting for Political Science as a subject or by acting 
as a responsible citizen in future.

How to Use this Book
+
This book retains several features with which you are familiar. These were 
introduced in your Political Science textbook for Class IX. This book also 
has some new features that you might wish to know about. 
Overview comes at the beginning of every chapter. It tells you about the 
purpose of the chapter and what is covered in it. Please read the overview 
before and after reading the chapter.
Section and sub-section headings: Each chapter is divided into 
sections and sub-sections. A section heading spreads over both columns on 
the page. This indicates the beginning a major part of the chapter and often 
covers a topic specified in the syllabus. The sub-section heading in a column 
indicates one point under the section concerned.
Graphics, Collages, Photographs and Posters occupy more space in this 
textbook than they did in your textbook for Class IX. You would continue 
to find a wide range of political Cartoons. These images provide visual relief 
and some fun. But you should not merely ‘see’ these images and turn the page. 
You are expected to ‘read’ the meaning of these images. Very often politics 
is carried out not through words but through images. The captions and 
questions that often accompany these images help you to read these images. 
Munni and Unni are back with you. Like you, they have also grown up 
a little since you met them in Class IX. They keep popping up and asking 
questions that you may have wished to ask. Do stop to engage with their 
questions. And don’t hesitate to ask similar questions to your teachers and 
parents.
Plus boxes contain supplementary information related to the theme of the 
chapter. Sometimes the plus box has a story that invites you to reflect on 
the dilemmas concerning our social and political life. You are supposed to 
read and discuss these. But you need not memorise the information and 
contents of the plus box. Nor is there a ‘correct’ answer to some of the moral 
questions posed there. These are just meant to help you think hard. Each 
plus box carries a special + sign.

Exercises
Let us watch television, Let us listen to radio, Let us read newspaper, Let us 
debate, Let’s find out or Let’s do it give students some activity in or outside 
the classroom. These activities become more meaningful when the students 
present their findings to the entire class and have the space for discussion. Where 
necessary, please feel free to substitute one type of media with another.
Glossary appears at the margin of the page in which an unfamiliar word or 
expression comes in the text. Such a word is highlighted in the text. Remember, 
you don’t need to learn the definition by heart. You just need to understand the 
word.
Let us revise usually comes at the end of every section. The questions invite you  
to apply the points learnt in that section to a specific situation. Teachers can 
come up with more such in-text exercises and use these to check the progress 
that everyone has made.
Exercises come at the end of every chapter. You would notice that we have 
introduced some new kinds of exercises, particularly in multiple choice format, 
which require reasoning and application of mind. Once you become familiar 
with the format, you would enjoy the challenge.
Maps are essential not just for understanding geography but also for history and 
politics. That is why some of the information is presented by way of maps in 
this book. You are not expected to draw the maps, but understand the patterns 
depicted here.

Overview
In this tour of democracy, we have come across political parties several 
times. In Class IX, we noticed the role of political parties in the rise of 
democracies, in the formation of constitutional designs, in electoral politics 
and in the making and working of governments. In this textbook, we have 
glanced at political parties as vehicles of federal sharing of political power 
and as negotiators of social divisions in the arena of democratic politics. 
Before concluding this tour, let us take a close look at the nature and 
working of political parties, especially in our country. We begin by asking 
two common questions: Why do we need parties? How many parties are 
good for a democracy? In the light of these, we introduce the national 
and regional political parties in today’s India and then look at what is 
wrong with political parties and what can be done about it.
Political Parties

Po lit ica l Pa r tie s

Why do we need political parties?
Political parties are easily one of 
the most visible institutions in a 
democracy. For most ordinary 
citizens, democracy is equal to 
political parties. If you travel to 
remote parts of our country and 
speak to the less educated citizens, 
you could come across people who 
may not know anything about our 
Constitution or about the nature of 
our government. But chances are 
that they would know something 
about our political parties. At the 
same time, this visibility does not 
mean popularity. Most people tend 
to be very critical of political parties. 
They tend to blame parties for all 
that is wrong with our democracy 
and our political life. Parties have 
become identified with social and 
political divisions. 
Therefore, it is natural to ask – do 
we need political parties at all? About 
hundred years ago, there were few 
countries of the world that had 
any political party. Now there are 
few that do not have parties. Why 
did political parties become so 
omnipresent in democracies all over 
the world? Let us first answer what 
political parties are and what they 
do, before we say why we need them.
Meaning
A political party is a group of 
people who come together to contest 
elections and hold power in the 
government. They agree on some 
policies and programmes for the 
society with a view to promote the 
collective good. Since there can be 
different views on what is good for 
So, you agree 
with me. Parties 
are partial, 
partisan and lead 
to partitions. 
Parties do 
nothing but 
divide people. 
That is their real 
function!
Election Commission has officially banned wall 
writing by parties during election times. Most 
political parties argue that was the cheapest way 
for their campaign. These election times used to 
create amazing graffiti on the walls. Here are some 
examples from Tamil Nadu.

Partisan: A person 
who is strongly 
committed to a 
party, group or 
faction. Partisanship 
is marked by a 
tendency to take a 
side and inability 
to take a balanced 
view on an issue. 
© RK Laxman - Brushing up the years 
all, parties try to persuade people 
why their policies are better than 
others. They seek to implement 
these policies by winning popular 
support through elections.
Thus, parties reflect fundamental 
political divisions in a society. Parties 
are about a part of the society and 
thus, involve partisanship. Thus, 
a party is known by which part it 
stands for, which policies it supports 
and whose interests it upholds. A 
political party has three components: 
	 the leaders, 
	 the active members and 
	 the followers
Functions
What does a political party do? 
Basically,  political parties fill political 
offices and exercise political power. 
Parties do so by performing a series 
of functions: 
1 	 Parties contest elections. In most 
democracies, elections are fought 
mainly among the candidates put 
up by political parties. Parties select 
their candidates in different ways. 
In some countries, such as the USA, 
members and supporters of a party 
choose its candidates. Now more 
and more countries are following 
this method. In other countries 
like India, top party leaders choose 
candidates for contesting elections. 
2 	 Parties put forward different 
policies and programmes and the 
voters choose from them. Each of 
us may have different opinions and 
views on what policies are suitable 
for the society. But no government 
can handle such a large variety 
of views. In a democracy, a large 
number of similar opinions have 
to be grouped together to provide 
a direction in which policies can 
be formulated by the governments. 
This is what the parties do. A party 
reduces a vast multitude of opinions 
into a few basic positions which it

supports. A government is expected 
to base its policies on the line taken 
by the ruling party. 
3 	 Parties play a decisive role 
in making laws for a country. 
Formally, laws are debated and 
passed in the legislature. But since 
most of the members belong to a 
party, they go by the direction of 
the party leadership, irrespective of 
their personal opinions.
4 	 Parties form and run governments.  
As we noted last year, the big policy 
decisions are taken by political 
executive that comes from the 
political parties. Parties recruit 
leaders, train them and then 
make them ministers to run the 
government in the way they want.
5 	 Those parties that lose in the 
elections play the role of opposition 
to the parties in power, by voicing 
different views and criticising 
government for its failures or 
wrong policies. Opposition parties 
also mobilise opposition to the 
government.
6 	 Parties shape public opinion. 
They raise and highlight issues. 
Parties have lakhs of members and 
activists spread all over the country. 
Many of the pressure groups are the 
extensions of political parties among 
different sections of society. Parties 
sometimes also launch movements 
for the resolution of problems 
faced by people. Often opinions in 
the society crystallise on the lines 
parties take. 
7 	 Parties provide people access 
to government machinery and 
welfare schemes implemented by 
governments. For an ordinary citizen 
it is easy to approach a local party 
leader than a government officer. 
That is why, they feel close to parties 
even when they do not fully trust 
them.  Parties have to be responsive 
to people’s needs and demands. 
Otherwise people can reject those 
parties in the next elections.
Necessity
This list of functions in a sense 
answers the question asked above: 
we need political parties because 
they perform all these functions. 
But we still need to ask why modern 
democracies cannot exist without 
political parties.  We can understand 
the necessity of political parties by 
imagining a situation without parties. 
Every candidate in the elections 
will be independent. So no one 
will be able to make any promises 
to the people about any major 
policy changes. The government 
may be formed, but its utility will 
remain ever uncertain. Elected 
representatives will be accountable 
to their constituency for what they 
do in the locality. But no one will 
be responsible for how the country 
will be run.
We can also think about it by 
looking at the non-party based 
elections to the panchayat in many 
states. Although, the parties do not 
contest formally, it is generally 
noticed that the village gets split into 
more than one faction, each of which 
puts up a ‘panel’ of its candidates. 
This is exactly what the party does. 
That is the reason we find political 
parties in almost all countries of the 
world, whether these countries are 
big or small, old or new, developed 
or developing. 
The rise of political parties is 
directly linked to the emergence 
of representative democracies.

As we have seen, large societies 
need representative democracy. 
As societies became large and 
complex, they also needed some 
agency to gather different views 
on various issues and to present 
these to the government. They 
needed some ways, to bring various 
representatives together so that a

responsible government could be 
formed. They needed a mechanism to 
support or restrain the government, 
make policies, justify or oppose 
them. Political parties fulfill these 
needs that every representative 
government has. We can say that 
parties are a necessary condition for 
a democracy.
How many parties should we have?
In a democracy any group of citizens 
is free to form a political party.  In 
this formal sense, there are a large 
number of political parties in each 
country. More than 750 parties 
are registered with the Election 
Commission of India. But not all 
these parties are serious contenders 
in the elections. Usually only a 
handful of parties are effectively in 
the race to win elections and form 
the government. So the question is: 
how many major or effective parties 
are good for a democracy?
In some countries, only one 
party is allowed to control and run 
the government. These are called 
one-party systems. In Class IX, 
we noted that in China, only the 
Communist Party is allowed to

rule. Although, legally speaking, 
people are free to form political 
parties, it does not happen because 
the electoral system does not permit 
free competition for power. We 
cannot consider one-party system as 
a good option because this is not a 
democratic option. Any democratic 
system must allow at least two parties 
to compete in elections and provide a 
fair chance for the competing parties 
to come to power. 
In some countries, power usually 
changes between two main parties. 
Several other parties may exist, 
contest elections and win a few seats 
in the national legislatures. But only 
the two main parties have a serious 
chance of winning majority of seats 
to form government. Such a party 
system is called two-party system. 
The United States of America and 
the United Kingdom are examples 
of two-party system. 
If several parties compete for 
power, and more than two parties 
have a reasonable chance of coming 
to power either on their own strength 
or in alliance with others, we call it 
a multiparty system. Thus in India, 
we have a multiparty system. In this 
system, the government is formed by 
various parties coming together in a 
coalition. When several parties in a 
multi-party system join hands for the 
purpose of contesting elections and 
winning power, it is called an alliance 
or a front. For example, in India 
there were three such major alliances 
in 2004 parliamentary elections– the 
National Democratic Alliance, the 
United Progressive Alliance and the 
Left Front. The multiparty system 
often appears very messy and leads 
to political instability. At the same 
time, this system allows a variety 
of interests and opinions to enjoy 
political representation.
So, which of these is better? 
Perhaps the best answer to this very 
common question is that this is not 
a very good question. Party system 
is not something any country can 
choose. It evolves over a long time, 
depending on the nature of society, 
its social and regional divisions, its 
history of politics and its system of 
elections. These cannot be changed 
very quickly. Each country develops a 
party system that is conditioned by its 
special circumstances. For example, if 
India has evolved a multiparty system, 
it is because the social and geographical 
diversity in such a large country is 
not easily absorbed by two or even 
three parties. No system is ideal for all 
countries and all situations.
I wonder how 
politicians 
manage these 
coalitions. I can’t 
even remember 
the names of all 
the parties.
Let us apply what we have learnt about party systems to the various 
states within India. Here are three major types of party systems that 
exist at the State level. Can you find the names of at least two States for 
each of these types?
 Two-party system
 Multiparty system with two alliances

participation It is often said that political parties are facing a 
crisis because they are very unpopular and the 
citizens are indifferent to political parties. The 
available evidence shows that this belief is only 
partly true for India. The evidence, based on a series of large 
sample surveys conducted over several decades, shows that:
	
Political parties do not enjoy much trust among the people in 
South Asia. The proportion of those who say their trust in political 
parties is ‘not much’ or ‘not at all’ is more than those who have 
‘some’ or ‘great’ trust. 
	
The same is true of most other democracies as well. Political 
parties are one of the least trusted institutions all over the world.
	
Yet the level of participation in the activities of political parties 
was fairly high. The proportion of those who said they were 
members of some political party was higher in India than many 
advanced countries like Canada, Japan, Spain and South Korea.
	
Over the last three decades, the proportion of those who 
report to be members of 
political parties in India has 
gone up steadily.
	
The proportion of those 
who say they feel ‘close to 
a political party’ has also 
gone up in India in this 
period.

National parties 
Democracies that follow a federal 
system all over the world tend to 
have two kinds of political parties: 
parties that are present in only one of 
the federal units and parties that are 
present in several or all units of the 
federation. This is the case in India 
as well. There are some country-wide 
parties, which are called ‘national 
parties’. These parties have their 
units in various states. But by and 
large, all these units follow the same 
policies, programmes and strategy 
that is decided at the national level. 
Every party in the country 
has to register with the Election 
Commission. While the Commission 
treats all parties equally, it offers 
some special facilities to large and 
established parties.  These parties 
are given a unique symbol – only 
the ofﬁ cial candidates of that party 
can use that election symbol. Parties 
that get this privilege and some other 
special facilities are ‘recognised’ by 
the Election Commission for this 
purpose. That is why these parties 
are called, ‘recognised political 
parties’. The Election Commission 
has laid down detailed criteria of 
the proportion of votes and seats 
that a party must get in order to 
be a recognised party. A party that 
secures at least six per cent of the 
total votes in an election to the 
Legislative Assembly of a State and 
wins at least two seats is recognised 
as a State party. A party that secures 
at least six per cent of the total votes 
in Lok Sabha elections or Assembly 
elections in four States and wins at 
least four seats in the Lok Sabha is 
recognised as a national party.
According to this classiﬁ cation, 
there are six recognized national 
parties in the country as per 
notification of the Election 
Commission of India issued in 2023.

Mukherjee in 1951. Wants to build a 
strong and modern India by drawing 
inspiration from India’s ancient 
culture and values; and Deendayal 
Upadhyaya’s ideas of integral 
humanism and Antyodaya. Cultural 
nationalism (or ‘Hindutva’) is an 
important element in its conception 
of Indian nationhood and politics.

integration of Jammu and Kashmir 
with India, a uniform civil code 
for all people living in the country 
irrespective of religion, and ban on 
religious conversions. Its support

Lok Sabha elections, it won about 1.75 
per cent of votes and 3 seats.
Indian National Congress 
(INC): Popularly known 
as the Congress Party. One 
of the oldest parties of the 
world. Founded in 1885 and 
has experienced many splits. Played 
a dominant role in Indian politics at 
the national and state level for several 
decades after India’s Independence. 
Under the leadership of Jawaharlal 
Nehru, the party sought to build a 
modern secular democratic republic in 
India. Ruling party at the centre till 1977 
and then from 1980 to 1989. After 1989, 
its support declined, but it continues 
to be present throughout the country, 
cutting across social divisions. A centrist 
party (neither rightist nor leftist) in 
its ideological orientation, the party 
espouses secularism and welfare of 
weaker sections and minorities. The 
INC supports new economic reforms 
but with a human face.  Leader of the 
United Progressive Alliance (UPA) 
government from 2004 to 2019. In the 
2019 Lok Sabha election, it won 19.5%

National People’s Party 
(NPP): Formed in July 2013 
under the leadership of P.A 
Sangma. NPP is the first 
political party from North 
East India to have attained 
the status of a national party. It 
believes in diversity of the country and 
recognizes that different regions have 
different developmental challenges. 
The core philosophy of the party is 
education and employment to all as 
well as empowerment of all sections of 
the society. It formed government in 
Meghalaya and has presence in many of 
North Eastern States. In the Lok Sabha 
election held in 2019, NPP secured one 
seat in the Lok Sabha.
State parties
Other than these seven parties, most 
of the major parties of the country are 
classified by the Election Commission 
as ‘State parties’. These are commonly 
referred to as regional parties. Yet 
these parties need not be regional in 
their ideology or outlook. Some of 
these parties are all India parties that 
happen to have succeeded only in 
some states. Parties like the Samajwadi 
Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal have 
national level political organisation 
with units in several states. Some of  
these parties like Biju Janata Dal, Sikkim 
Democratic Front,  Mizo National  
Front and Telangana Rashtra Samithi 
are conscious about their State identity. 
Over the last three decades, the 
number and strength of these parties has 
expanded. This made the Parliament 
of India politically more and more 
diverse. No one national party is able 
to secure on its own a majority in the 
Lok Sabha, until 2014. As a result, the 
national parties are compelled to form 
alliances with State parties. Since 1996, 
nearly every one of the State parties has 
got an opportunity to be a part of one 
or the other national level coalition 
government. This has contributed to 
the strengthening of federalism and 
democracy in our country. (See the 
map on the next page for details of 
these parties).

Challenges to political parties
We have seen how crucial political 
parties are for the working of 
democracy. Since parties are the 
most visible face of democracy, it is 
natural that people blame parties for 
whatever is wrong with the working 
of democracy. All over the world, 
people express strong dissatisfaction 
with the failure of political parties 
to perform their functions well. 
This is the case in our country too. 
Popular dissatisfaction and criticism 
has focussed on four problem areas 
in the working of political parties. 
Political parties need to face and 
overcome these challenges in order 
to remain effective instruments  
of democracy.
The first challenge is lack of 
internal democracy within parties. 
All over the world there is a tendency 
in political parties towards the 
concentration of power in one or 
few leaders at the top. Parties do not 
keep membership registers, do not 
hold organisational meetings, and 
do not conduct internal elections 
regularly. Ordinary members of 
the party do not get sufficient 
information on what happens inside 
the party. They do 
not have the means 
or the connections 
needed to influence 
the decisions. As a 
result, the leaders 
assume greater 
power to make 
decisions in the 
name of the party. 
Since one or few 
leaders exercise 
paramount power 
in the party, those 
who disagree with 
the leadership find 
Why don’t 
parties give 
enough tickets 
to women? Is 
that also due to 
lack of internal 
democracy?
Berlusconi was the Prime 
Minister of Italy. He is also 
one of the top businessmen 
in Italy. He is the leader of 
the Forza Italia founded in 
1993. His company owns TV 
channels, the most important 
publishing company, a foot 
ball club (AC Milan) and a 
bank. This cartoon was made 
during the last elections.

it difficult to continue in the party. 
More than loyalty to party principles 
and policies, personal loyalty to the 
leader becomes more important. 
The second challenge of dynastic 
succession is related to the first 
one. Since most political parties do 
not practice open and transparent 
procedures for their functioning, 
there are very few ways for an 
ordinary worker to rise to the top 
in a party. Those who happen to be 
the leaders are in a position of unfair 
advantage to favour people close to 
them or even their family members. 
In many parties, the top positions 
are always controlled by members 
of one family. This is unfair to other 
members of that party. This is also 
bad for democracy, since people who 
do not have adequate experience or 
popular support come to occupy 
positions of power. This tendency 
is present in some measure all over 
the world, including in some of the 
older democracies.  
The third challenge is about 
the growing role of money and 
muscle power in parties, especially 
during elections. Since parties are 
focussed only on winning elections, 
they tend to use short-cuts to win 
elections. They tend to nominate 
those candidates who have or can 
raise lots of money. Rich people and 
companies who give funds to the 
parties tend to have influence on the 
policies and decisions of the party. In 
some cases, parties support criminals 
who can win elections. Democrats 
all over the world are worried about 
the increasing role of rich people and 
big companies in democratic politics.
The fourth challenge is that 
very often parties do not seem to 
offer a meaningful choice to the 
voters. In order to offer meaningful 
choice, parties must be significantly 
different. In recent years, there has 
been a decline in the ideological 
differences among parties in most 
parts of the world. For example, 
the difference between the Labour 
Party and the Conservative Party 
in Britain is very little. They agree 
on more fundamental aspects but 
differ only in details on how policies 
are to be framed and implemented. 
In our country too, the differences 
among all the major parties on the 
economic policies have reduced. 
Those who want really different 
policies have no option available 
to them. Sometimes people cannot 
even elect very different leaders 
either, because the same set of 
leaders keep shifting from one 
party to another.

How can parties be reformed?
In order to face these challenges, 
political parties need to be reformed. 
The question is: Are political parties 
willing to reform? If they are willing, 
what has prevented them from 
reforming so far? If they are not 
willing, is it possible to force them 
to reform? Citizens all over the 
world face this question. This is not 
a simple question to answer. In a 
democracy, the final decision is made 
by leaders who represent political 
parties. People can replace them, 
but only by another set of party 
leaders. If all of them do not wish to 
reform, how can anyone force them 
to change?
Let us look at some of the 
recent efforts and suggestions in our 
country to reform political parties 
and its leaders:
	 The Constitution was amended 
to prevent elected MLAs and MPs 
from changing parties. This was done 
because many elected representatives 
were indulging in defection in order 
to become ministers or for cash 
rewards. Now the law says that if 
Defection: Changing 
party allegiance from 
the party on which a 
person got elected (to 
a legislative body) to 
a different party.
Can you identify which of the challenges described in this section are being 
highlighted in these cartoons (on pages 57 to 59)? What are the ways to 
curb the misuse of money and muscle power in politics?
Does this 
suggest that 
in democracies 
people contest 
elections only to 
make money? 
But isn’t it 
true that there 
are politicians 
committed to 
the well-being 
of the people?

any MLA or MP changes parties, 
he or she will lose the seat in the 
legislature. This new law has helped 
bring defection down. At the same 
time, this has made any dissent even 
more difficult. MPs and MLAs have 
to accept whatever the party leaders 
decide.
	 The Supreme Court passed an 
order to reduce the influence of 
money and criminals. Now, it is 
mandatory for every candidate who 
contests elections to file an affidavit 
giving details of his property and 
criminal cases pending against him. 
The new system has made a lot of 
information available to the public. 
But there is no system to check if the 
information given by the candidates 
is true. As yet we do not know if it 
has led to decline in the influence of 
the rich and the criminals.
	 The Election Commission 
passed an order making it necessary 
for political parties to hold their 
organisational elections and file their 
income tax returns. The parties have 
started doing so but sometimes it 
is mere formality. It is not clear if 
this step has led to greater internal 
democracy in political parties.
Besides these, many suggestions 
are often made to reform political 
parties: 
	 A law should be made to regulate 
the internal affairs of political parties. 
It should be made compulsory for 
political parties to maintain a register 
of its members, to follow its own 
constitution, to have an independent 
authority, to act as a judge in case of 
party disputes, to hold open elections 
to the highest posts.
	 It should be made mandatory for 
political parties to give a minimum 
number of tickets, about one-third, 
to women candidates. Similarly, 
there should be a quota for women 
in the decision making bodies of 
the party.
	 There should be state funding of 
elections. The government should 
give parties money to support their 
election expenses. This support 
could be given in kind: petrol, paper, 
telephone, etc. Or it could be given in 
cash on the basis of the votes secured 
by the party in the last election.
These suggestions have not yet 
been accepted by political parties. If 
and when these are accepted these 
could lead to some improvement. 
But we must be very careful about 
legal solutions to political problems. 
Over-regulation of political parties 
can be counter-productive. This 
would force all parties to find ways 
to cheat the law. Besides, political 
parties will not agree to pass a law 
that they do not like.
There are two other ways 
in which political parties can be 
reformed. One, people can put 
Affidavit: A signed 
document submitted 
to an officer, where a 
person makes a sworn 
statement regarding her 
personal information.
Do you agree that this form of reforming political parties will be 
acceptable to them?

pressure on political parties. This can 
be done through petitions, publicity 
and agitations. Ordinary citizens, 
pressure groups and movements and 
the media can play an important role 
in this. If political parties feel that 
they would lose public support by 
not taking up reforms, they would 
become more serious about reforms. 
Two, political parties can improve if 
those who want this, join political 
parties. The quality of democracy 
depends on the degree of public 
participation. It is difficult to reform 
politics if ordinary citizens do not 
take part in it and simply criticise 
it from the outside. The problem of 
bad politics can be solved by more 
and better politics. We shall return

Muhammad Yunus is a famous economist of Bangladesh. 
He received several international honours for his efforts to 
promote economic and social development for the benefit of 
the poor. He and the Grameen Bank that he started jointly, 
received the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2006. In February 
2007, he decided to launch a political party and contest in the 
parliamentary elections. His objective was to foster proper 
leadership, good governance and build a new Bangladesh. 
He felt that only a political party different from the traditional 
ones would bring about new political culture. His party would 
be democratic from the grassroots level.
	
	
	
The launching of the new party, called Nagarik Shakti 
(Citizens’ Power), has caused a stir among the Bangladeshis. 
While many welcomed his decision, some did not like it. “Now 
I think Bangladesh will have a chance to choose between 
good and bad and eventually have a good government,” said 
Shahedul Islam, a government official. “That government, we 
hope, would not only keep itself away from corruption but also 
make fighting corruption and black money a top priority.” 
	
	
	
But leaders of traditional political parties who dominated 
the country’s politics for decades were apprehensive. “There 
was no debate (over him) winning the Nobel, but politics is 
different – very challenging and often controversial,” said 
a senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Some 
others were highly critical. They asked why he was rushing 
into politics. “Is he being planted in politics by mentors from 
outside the country,” asked one political observer. 
	
Do you think Yunus made a right decision to float a new political 
party?
	
Do you agree with the statements and fears expressed by various 
people? How do you want this new party organised to make it 
different from other parties? If you were the one to begin this 
political party, how would you defend it?

Outcomes of 
Democracy
Overview
As we begin to wind up our tour of democracy, it is time to move 
beyond our discussion of specific themes and ask a general set of 
questions: What does democracy do? Or, what outcomes can we 
reasonably expect of democracy? Also, does democracy fulfil these 
expectations in real life? We begin by thinking about how to assess 
the outcomes of democracy. After some clarity on how to think on 
this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes 
of democracy in various respects: quality of government, economic 
well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict and finally 
freedom and dignity.

How do we assess democracy’s outcomes?
Do you remember how students 
in Madam Lyngdoh’s class argued 
about democracy? This was in 
Chapter 2 of Class IX textbook. 
It emerged from that conversation 
that democracy is a better form of 
government when compared with 
dictatorship or any other alternative. 
We felt that democracy was better 
because it:
	 Promotes equality among 
citizens;
	 Enhances the dignity of the 
individual;
	 Improves the quality of 
decision-making;
	 Provides a method to resolve 
conflicts; and
	 Allows room to correct mistakes.
Are these expectations realised 
under democracies? When we talk 
to people around us, most of them 
support democracy against other 
alternatives, such as rule by a monarch 
or military or religious leaders. But 
not so many of them would be 
satisfied with the democracy in 
practice. So we face a dilemma: 
democracy is seen to be good in 
principle, but felt to be not so good in 
its practice. This dilemma invites us 
to think hard about the outcomes of 
democracy. Do we prefer democracy 
only for moral reasons? Or are there 
some prudential reasons to support 
democracy too?
Over a hundred countries of 
the world today claim and practice 
some kind of democratic politics: 
they have formal constitutions, they 
hold elections, they have parties and 
they guarantee rights of citizens. 
While these features are common to 
most of them, these democracies are 
very much different from each other 
in terms of their social situations, 
their economic achievements and 
their cultures. Clearly, what may be 
achieved or not achieved under each 
of these democracies will be very 
different. But is there something that 
we can expect from every democracy, 
just because it is democracy?
Our interest in and fascination 
for democracy often pushes us into 
taking a position that democracy 
can address all socio-economic and 
political problems. If some of our 
expectations are not met, we start 
blaming the idea of democracy. Or, 
we start doubting if we are living in 
a democracy. The first step towards 
thinking carefully about the outcomes 
of democracy is to recognise 
that democracy is just a form 
of government. It can only create 
conditions for achieving something. 
The citizens have to take advantage 
of those conditions and achieve 
those goals. Let us examine some of 
the things we can reasonably expect 
from democracy and examine the 
record of democracy.
Did we

Accountable, responsive and legitimate government
There are some things that democracy 
must provide. In a democracy, we 
are most concerned with ensuring 
that people will have the right 
to choose their rulers and people 
will have control over the rulers. 
Whenever possible and necessary, 
citizens should be able to participate 
in decision making, that affects 
them all. Therefore, the most basic 
outcome of democracy should 
be that it produces a government 
that is accountable to the citizens, 
and responsive to the needs and 
expectations of the citizens. 
Before we go into this question, 
we face another common question: Is 
the democratic government efficient? 
Is it effective? Some people think that 
democracy produces less effective 
government. It is, of course, true that 
non-democratic rulers do not have to 
bother about deliberation in assemblies 
or worry about majorities and public 
opinion. So, they can be very quick 
and efficient in decision making 
and implementation. Democracy 
is based on the idea of deliberation 
and negotiation. So, some delay is 
bound to take place. Does that make 
democratic government inefficient?
Let us think in terms of costs. 
Imagine a government that may 
take decisions very fast. But it may 
take decisions that are not accepted 
by the people and may therefore 
face problems. In contrast, the 
democratic government will take 
more time to follow procedures 
before arriving at a decision. But 
because it has followed procedures, 
its decisions may be both more 
acceptable to the people and more 
effective. So, the cost of time that 
democracy pays is perhaps worth it. 
Now look at the other side – 
democracy ensures that decision 
making will be based on norms and 
procedures. So, a citizen who wants 
to know if a decision was taken 
through the correct procedures 
can find this out. She has the right 
and the means to examine the 
process of decision making. This 
is known as transparency. This 
factor is often missing from a  
non-democratic government. 
Therefore, when we are trying to 
find out the outcomes of democracy, 
it is right to expect democracy to 
produce a government that follows 
procedures and is accountable to the 
people. We can also expect that the 
democratic government develops 
mechanisms for citizens to hold 
the government accountable and 
mechanisms for citizens to take part 
in decision making whenever they 
think fit. 
If you wanted to measure 
democracies on the basis of this 
expected outcome, you would look 
for the following practices and 
institutions: regular, free and fair 
elections; open public debate on

major policies and legislations; 
and citizens’ right to information 
about the government and its 
functioning. The actual performance 
of democracies shows a mixed 
record on this. Democracies have 
had greater success in setting up 
regular and free elections and in 
setting up conditions for open 
public debate. But most democracies 
fall short of elections that provide 
a fair chance to everyone and in 
subjecting every decision to public 
debate. Democratic governments do 
not have a very good record when 
it comes to sharing information 
with citizens. All one can say in 
favour of democratic regimes is 
that they are much better than any 
n o n - d e m o c r a t i c  r e g i m e  i n 
these respects. 
In substantive terms, it may be 
reasonable to expect from democracy 
a government that is attentive to the 
needs and demands of the people 
and is largely free of corruption. 
The record of democracies is not 
impressive on these two counts. 
Democracies often frustrate the 
needs of the people and often ignore 
the demands of a majority of its 
population. The routine tales of 
corruption are enough to convince us 
that democracy is not free of this evil. 
At the same time, there is nothing 
to show that non-democracies are 
less corrupt or more sensitive to 
the people. 
There is one respect in which 
democratic government is certainly 
better than its alternatives: demo-
cratic government is legitimate 
government. It may be slow, 
less efficient, not always very 
responsive or clean. But a democratic 
government is people’s own 
government. That is why, there is 
an overwhelming support for the 
idea of democracy all over the world. 
As the accompanying evidence from 
South Asia shows, the support 
exists in countries with democratic 
regimes as well as countries without 
democratic regimes. People wish to 
be ruled by representatives elected 
by them. They also believe that 
democracy is suitable for their 
country. Democracy’s ability to 
generate its own support is itself an 
outcome that cannot be ignored.

Economic growth and development
If democracies are expected to 
produce good governments, then 
is it not fair to expect that they 
would also produce development? 
Evidence shows that in practice, 
many democracies did not fulfil this 
expectation. 
If you consider all democracies 
and all dictatorships for the fifty 
years between 1950 and 2000, 
dictatorships have slightly higher rate 
of economic growth. The inability 
of democracy to achieve higher 
economic development worries us. 
But this alone cannot be reason 
to reject democracy. As you have 
already studied in economics, 
economic development depends on 
several factors: country’s population 
The Rich Get Buff 
size, global situation, cooperation 
from other countries, economic 
priorities adopted by the country, 
etc. However, the difference in the 
rates of economic development 
between less developed countries 
with dictatorships and democracies 
is negligible. Overall, we cannot say 
that democracy is a guarantee of 
economic development. But we can 
expect democracy not to lag behind 
dictatorships in this respect. 
When we find such significant 
difference in the rates of economic 
growth between countries under 
dictatorship and democracy, it is 
better to prefer democracy as it has 
several other positive outcomes.

Arguments about democracy tend to be 
very passionate. This is how it should 
be, for democracy appeals to some of 
our deep values. These debates cannot 
be resolved in a simple manner. But 
some debates about democracy can and 
should be resolved by referring to some 
facts and figures. The debate about the 
economic outcomes of democracy is 
one such debate. Over the years, many 
students of democracy have gathered 
careful evidence to see what the 
relationship of democracy with economic 
growth and economic inequalities is. 
The tables and the cartoon here present 
some of the evidences:
	
Table 1 shows that on an average dictatorial regimes have had a slightly better record 
of economic growth. But when we compare their record only in poor countries, there is 
virtually no difference.
	
Table 2 shows that within democracies there can be very high degree of inequalities. 
In democratic countries like South Africa and Brazil, the top 20 per cent people take away 
more than 60 per cent of the national income, leaving less than 3 per cent for the bottom 
20 per cent population. Countries like Denmark and Hungary are much better in this 
respect.
	
You can see in the cartoon, there is often inequality of opportunities available to the 
poorer sections.
What would be your verdict on democracy if you had to base it purely on economic 
performance of democratic regimes in terms of growth and equal distribution?

Reduction of inequality and poverty
Perhaps more than development, it 
is reasonable to expect democracies 
to reduce economic disparities. Even 
when a country achieves economic 
growth, will wealth be distributed 
in such a way that all citizens of the 
country will have a share and lead 
a better life? Is economic growth 
in democracies accompanied by 
increased inequalities among the 
people? Or do democracies lead 
to a just distribution of goods and 
opportunities?
© Ares - Best of Latin America, Cagle Cartoons Inc. 
Democracies are based on political 
equality. All individuals have equal 
weight in electing representatives. 
Parallel to the process of bringing 
individuals into the political arena 
on an equal footing, we find growing 
economic inequalities. A small 
number of ultra-rich enjoy a highly 
disproportionate share of wealth and 
incomes. Not only that, their share 
in the total income of the country 
has been increasing. Those at the 
bottom of the society have very little 
to depend upon. Their incomes have 
been declining. Sometimes they find 
it difficult to meet their basic needs 
of life, such as food, clothing, house, 
education and health. 
In actual life, democracies do 
not appear to be very successful in 
reducing economic inequalities. In 
Class IX Economics textbook, you 
have already studied about poverty in 
India. The poor constitute a large 
proportion of our voters and no 
party will like to lose their 
votes. Yet democratically 
elected governments do 
not appear to be as keen 
to address the question 
of poverty as you would 
expect them to. The 
situation is much worse 
in some other countries. 
In Bangladesh, more than 
half of its population 
lives in poverty. People 
in several poor countries 
are now dependent on the 
rich countries even for 
food supplies.
Voice of the Poor
Democracy is 
a rule of the 
majority. The 
poor are in 
majority. So 
democracy must 
be a rule of the 
poor. How can 
this not be the 
case?

Accommodation of social diversity
All you are 
saying is that 
democracy 
ensures that 
people do not 
break each 
other’s head. 
This is not 
harmony. Should 
we be happy 
about it?
Do democracies lead to peaceful and 
harmonious life among citizens? 
It will be a fair expectation that 
democracy should produce a 
harmonious social life. We have 
seen in the earlier chapters how 
democracies accommodate various 
social divisions. We saw in the first 
chapter how Belgium has successfully 
negotiated differences among ethnic 
populations. Democracies usually 
develop a procedure to conduct 
their competition. This reduces 
the possibility of these tensions 
becoming explosive or violent.
No society can fully and 
permanently resolve conflicts among 
different groups. But we can certainly 
learn to respect these differences and 
we can also evolve mechanisms to 
negotiate the differences. Democracy 
is best suited to produce this 
outcome. Non-democratic regimes 
often turn a blind eye to or suppress 
internal social differences. Ability to 
handle social differences, divisions 
and conflicts is thus a definite plus 
point of democratic regimes. But 
the example of Sri Lanka reminds 
us that a democracy must fulfil two 
conditions in order to achieve this 
outcome:
	 It is necessary to understand 
that democracy is not simply rule 
by majority opinion.  The majority 
always needs to work with the 
minority so that governments 
function to represent the general 
view. Majority and minority 
opinions are not permanent.
	 It is also necessary that rule by 
majority does not become rule by 
majority community in terms of 
religion or race or linguistic group, 
etc.  Rule by majority means that in 
case of every decision or in case of

every election, different persons and 
groups may and can form a majority. 
Democracy remains democracy only 
as long as every citizen has a chance 
of being in majority at some point 
The two images depict two different kinds of 
effects democratic politics can have on social 
divisions. Take one example for each image 
and write a paragraph each on the outcome of 
democratic politics in both situations.
of time. If someone is barred from 
being in majority on the basis of 
birth, then the democratic rule ceases 
to be accommodative for that person 
or group.
Dignity and freedom of the citizens
Democracy stands much superior 
to any other form of government 
in promoting dignity and freedom 
of the individual. Every individual 
wants to receive respect from 
fellow beings. Often conflicts arise 
among individuals because some feel 
that they are not treated with due 
respect. The passion for respect and 
freedom are the basis of democracy. 
Democracies throughout the world 
have recognised this, at least in 
principle. This has been achieved 
in various degrees in various 
democracies. For societies which 
have been built for long on the basis 
of subordination and domination, it 
is not a simple matter to recognise 
that all individuals are equal. 
Take the case of dignity of 
women. Most societies across 
the world were historically male 
dominated societies. Long struggles 
by women have created some 
sensitivity today that respect to 
and equal treatment of women are

necessary ingredients of a democratic 
society. That does not mean that 
women are actually always treated 
with respect. But once the principle 
is recognised, it becomes easier for 
women to wage a struggle against 
what is now unacceptable legally 
and morally. In a non-democratic 
set up, this unacceptability would 
not have legal basis because the 
principle of individual freedom and 
dignity would not have the legal and 
moral force there. The same is true 
of caste inequalities. Democracy in 
India has strengthened the claims of 
the disadvantaged and discriminated 
castes for equal status and equal 
opportunity. There are instances 
still of caste-based inequalities and 
atrocities, but these lack the moral 
and legal foundations. Perhaps, it is 
the recognition that makes ordinary 
citizens value their democratic rights.
Expectations from democracy 
also function as the criteria for 
judging any democratic country. 
What is most distinctive about 
democracy is that its examination 
never gets over. As democracy 
passes one test, it produces another 
test. As people get some benefits of 
democracy, they ask for more and 
want to make democracy even better. 
That is why, when we ask people 
about the way democracy functions, 
they will always come up with more 
expectations, and many complaints. 
The fact that people are complaining 
is itself a testimony to the success of 
democracy: it shows that people have 
developed awareness and the ability 
to expect and to look critically at 
power holders and the high and 
the mighty. A public expression of 
dissatisfaction with democracy shows 
the success of the democratic project: 
it transforms people from the status 
of a subject into that of a citizen. 
Most individuals today believe that 
their vote makes a difference to the 
way the government is run and to 
their own self-interest.

Nannu is a daily wage earner. He lives in Welcome Mazdoor 
Colony, a slum habitation in East Delhi. He lost his ration card 
and applied for a duplicate one in January 2004. He made 
several rounds to the local Food and Civil Supplies office for 
the next three months. But the clerks and officials would 
not even look at him, leave alone do his job or bother to 
tell him the status of his application. Ultimately, he filed an 
application under the Right to Information Act asking for the 
daily progress made on his application, names of the officials, 
who were supposed to act on his application and what action 
would be taken against these officials for their inaction. Within 
a week of filing application under the Right to Information Act, 
he was visited by an inspector from the Food Department, 
who informed him that the card had been made and he could 
collect it from the office. When Nannu went to collect his card 
next day, he was given a very warm treatment by the Food 
and Supply Officer (FSO), who is the head of a Circle. The FSO 
offered him tea and requested him to withdraw his application 
under the Right to Information, since his work had already 
been done.
