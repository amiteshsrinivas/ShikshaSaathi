The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between
the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks
developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this
basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the
maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.
We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the
direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the
National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on
their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and
questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom,
children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information
passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as
the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other
resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity
and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and
mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary
as rigour in implementing the annual  calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a
happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom.
Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular
burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time
available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this
endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for
contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and
activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training
(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development
committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the
Chairperson of the advisory committee for textbooks in Social
Sciences, at the higher secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan

After the long vacation, when Ravi started going to school
again, he noticed that the only playground next to his school
was dug up. People said that a huge building with many
flats will be constructed there. Ravi was almost in tears,
when he realised that the big playground with its soft
grass, marigolds and butterflies is gone for ever. He shared
his feelings with his classmates. In the assembly, the
Principal too sadly observed, “See how our environment
is changing.”
In the class Ravi asked his teacher, “What is
environment?” “Whatever you see in your surroundings,”
said the teacher.
Ravi thought aloud, “That means, the school building,
tables, chairs in the classroom, even that open field, the
road, the garbage, my friends – all are parts of our
environment”!
“Yes” said the teacher, “but wait….. Some objects are
created by nature – for example, mountains, rivers, trees,
animals. Others are made by people – for example roads,
cars, clothes, books”.
Now work in pairs. Make a list with your classmate
sitting next to you, of the creations of nature and by
human beings.
Environment is our
basic life support
system. It provides
the air we breath, the
water we drink, the
food we eat and the
land where we live.
How do human
beings modify this
natural environment?
The car fumes pollute
the air, water is
collected in a pot,
food is served in
vessels and land is
used to build
factories.
Human beings
make cars, mills,
factories and
manufacture
containers. This is
how human beings
modify natural
environment.

Ravi, Paramjeet, Jessy, Mustafa, Asha were all excited
about making the list. “Why is our environment changing?”
asked Iqbal. “It’s all because of our needs. They are

teacher replied.
From the above conversation you
understand that the place, people, things and
nature that surround any living organism is
called environment. It is a combination of
natural and human made phenomena. While

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Land, water, air, plants and animals comprise the natural
environment. You are familiar with the meaning of
lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere
from your previous class. Let us learn some more facts
about these domains.
Lithosphere is the solid crust or the hard top layer of
the earth. It is made up of rocks and minerals and covered
by a thin layer of soil. It is an irregular surface with
various landforms such as mountains, plateaus, plains,
valleys, etc. Landforms are found over the continents
and also on the ocean floors.
Lithosphere is the domain that provides us forests,
grasslands for grazing, land for agriculture and human
settlements. It is also a source of mineral wealth.
Look at your
surroundings. Make a
list of uses that the
land in your
neighbourhood is
being put to.

Where does the water
you use in your home
and school come

different uses of
water in our daily life.
Have you seen anyone
wasting water? How?
Observe the sky while
coming to school.
Make a note whether
the day is cloudy,
rainy, sunny, foggy etc.
The domain of water is referred to as hydrosphere. It
comprises various sources of water and different types of
water bodies like rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, etc. It is
essential for all living organisms.
The atmosphere is the thin layer of air that
surrounds the earth. The gravitational force of the
earth holds the atmosphere around it. It protects us

from the harmful rays and scorching heat of the sun.
It consists of a number of gases, dust and water vapour.
The changes in the atmosphere produce changes in
the weather and climate.
Plant and animal kingdom together make biosphere
or the living world. It is a narrow zone of the earth
where land, water and air interact with each other to
support life.
What is ecosystem?
At an NCC camp that Ravi’s class was attending, Jessy
exclaimed, “What a heavy downpour.  It reminds me of
my home in Kerala. You should come and see how it
pours and pours and pours over the lush green fields
and coconut plantations.”
Heera from Jaisalmer exclaimed, “We get no rains.
We see only ‘kikar’ and sand, as far as the eyes can
see.” “But you also find camels”, said Ravi.
Let’s do
Sketch or bring
photographs of your
place like the
students in the story.
Ecosystem: It is a
system formed by the
interaction of all
living organisms with
each other and with
the physical and
chemical factors of
the environment in
which they live, all
linked by transfer of
energy and material.

Heera says, “Not just camels. If you visit our desert,
you will see snakes, lizards and many insects too.”
 Ravi wondered, “Why do the animals, the vegetation
and the way people live vary from place to place? Are
they all related to each other?”
“Oh yes, very much so”, the teacher replied.
All plants, animals and human beings depend on
their immediate surroundings. Often they are also
interdependent on each other. This relation between the
living organisms, as well as the relation between the
organisms and their surroundings form an ecosystem.
There could be an ecosystem of large rain forest,
grassland, desert, mountains, lake, river, ocean and even
a small pond.
Do you think the park in which Ravi and his friends
played formed an ecosystem?
HUMAN ENVIRONMENT
Human beings interact with the environment and modify
it according to their need. Early humans adapted
themselves to the natural surroundings. They led a
simple life and fulfilled their requirements from the
nature around them. With time needs grew and became
more varied. Humans learn new ways to use and change
environment. They learn to grow crops, domesticate
animals and lead a settled life. The wheel was invented,
surplus food was produced, barter system emerged, trade
started and commerce developed. Industrial revolution
enabled large scale production. Transportation became
faster. Information revolution made communication
easier and speedy across the world.
Have you ever thought why you love eating a juicy
watermelon in summer and hot roasted peanuts in
winter? A perfect balance is necessary between the
natural and human environment. Humans must learn
to live and use their environment in a harmonious way.
Nurie, a girl from Mizoram from Ravi’s class often talks
about the lush green surroundings of her place. Seeing
Ravi upset at having lost his playground, Nurie invited
him to visit her home state during the coming vacation.
Ravi’s teacher asked the students to draw the landscape,
houses and activities of the people and places they visit
during the holidays.

The earth, our homeland is a dynamic planet. It is
constantly undergoing changes inside and outside. Have
you ever wondered what lies in the interior of the earth?
What is the earth made up of?
INTERIOR OF THE EARTH
Just like an onion, the
earth is made up of
several 
concentric
layers with one inside
another (Fig. 2.1). The
uppermost layer over
the earth’s surface is
called the crust. It is the
thinnest of all the
layers. It is about 35 km.
on the continental
masses and only 5 km.
on the ocean floors.
The 
main 
mineral
constituents 
of 
the
continental mass are
silica and alumina. It is
thus called sial (si-silica
and al-alumina). The
oceanic crust mainly
consists of silica and
magnesium; it is therefore
called sima (si-silica and
ma-magnesium) (Fig. 2.2).
Just beneath the crust
is the mantle which
extends up to a depth of
2900 km. below the crust.

Glossary
The innermost layer is the core with a radius of about
3500 km. It is mainly made up of nickel and iron and is
called nife (ni – nickel and fe – ferrous i.e. iron). The
central core has very high temperature and pressure.
ROCKS AND MINERALS
The earth’s crust is made up of various types of rocks.
Any natural mass of mineral matter that makes up the
earth’s crust is called a rock. Rocks can be of different
colour, size and texture.
There are three major types of rocks: igneous rocks,
sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks.
When the molten magma cools, it becomes solid.
Rocks thus formed are called igneous rocks. They are
also called primary rocks. There are two types of igneous
rocks: intrusive rocks and extrusive rocks.
Can you imagine lava coming out from the volcanoes?
Lava is actually fiery red molten magma coming out from
the interior of the earth on its surface. When this molten
lava comes on the earth’s surface, it rapidly cools down
and becomes solid. Rocks formed in such a way on the
crust are called extrusive igneous rocks. They have a
very fine grained structure. For example, basalt. The
Deccan plateau is made up of basalt rocks. Sometimes
the molten magma cools down deep inside the earth’s
crust. Solid rocks so formed are called intrusive igneous
rocks. Since they cool down slowly they form large
grains. Granite is an example of such a rock. Grinding
stones used to prepare paste/powder of spices and grains
are made of granite.
Rocks roll down, crack, and hit each other and are
broken down into small fragments. These smaller particles
are called sediments. These sediments are transported
and deposited by wind, water, etc. These loose
sediments are compressed and hardened to form
layers of rocks. These types of rocks are called
sedimentary rocks. For example, sandstone is
made from grains of sand. These rocks may also
contain fossils of plants, animals and other micro-
organisms that once lived on them.
Igneous and sedimentary rocks can change
into metamorphic rocks under great heat and
pressure (Fig. 2.3). For example, clay changes into
slate and limestone into marble.
Fig. 2.3: Sedimentary rock turned
into a Metamorphic rock
Fossils: The remains
of the dead plants and
animals trapped in
the layers of rocks are
called fossils.
WordOrigin
Igneous: Latin word
Ignis meaning fire.
Sedimentary: Latin
word sedimentum
meaning settle down.
Metamorphic: Greek
word metamorphose
meaning change of form.
Doyouknow?
• The crust forms only
1 per cent of the
volume of the earth,
84 per cent consists
of the mantle and
15 per cent makes
the core.
• The radius of the
earth is 6371 km.

The Taj Mahal is made of white marble
The Red Fort is made of red sandstone
Collect pictures of some monuments and find out which are the rocks

Rocks are very useful to us. The hard rocks are used
for making roads, houses and buildings. You use stones
in many games. For example, seven stones (pitthoo), hop-
scotch (stapu/kit kit), five stones (gitti). Find out some
more such games by asking your grand parents, parents,
neighbours, etc.
You will be surprised to know that one type of rock
changes to another type under certain conditions in a
cyclic manner. This process of transformation of the rock
from one to another is known as the rock cycle. You
have already learnt when the
molten magma cools; it solidifies
to become igneous rock. These
igneous rocks are broken down
into small particles that are
transported and deposited to
form sedimentary rocks. When
the igneous and sedimentary
rocks are subjected to heat
and pressure they change
into metamorphic rocks. The
metamorphic rocks which are still
under great heat and pressure
melt down to form molten magma.
This molten magma again can
cool down and solidify into
igneous rocks (Fig. 2.4).

Take a small coloured
paper pellet and put it
in a beaker
half filled
with water.
Place the
beaker on a
tripod stand
and heat it. As the
water warms up, you
will observe that the
paper pellet is moving
upward along with the
warm layers of water
and then
sinks back
along with
the cooler
layers of water. The
molten magma inside
the earth moves in a
similar manner.
The lithosphere is broken into a number of plates known
as the Lithospheric plates. You will be surprised to know
that these plates move around very slowly – just a few
millimetres each year. This is because of the movement
of the molten magma inside the earth. The molten magma
inside the earth moves in a circular manner as shown in
the activity.
The movement of these plates causes changes on the
surface of the earth. The earth movements are divided
on the basis of the forces which cause them. The forces
which act in the interior of the earth are called as
Endogenic forces and the forces that work on the surface
of the earth are called as Exogenic forces (Fig. 3.1).

Take a container, fill
it with water and
close it with a lid. Put
the water to boil. Now
put some peas, spoon
and beads on top on
the lid. What do you
notice? As the water
boils the lid begins to
shake. The things
which you have put
on the lid also
vibrate. The beads roll
down and the spoon
vibrates to make a
sound. In the same
manner, the earth
vibrates when an
earthquake occurs.
Do you know?
There are three types
of earthquake waves:
1. P waves or
longitudinal waves
2. S waves or
transverse waves
3. L waves or surface
waves
Try to find out the
properties of these
waves from an
encyclopedia.
Similarly, when the Lithospheric plates move, the
surface of the earth vibrates. The vibrations can travel
all round the earth. These vibrations are called
earthquakes (Fig. 3.3). The place in the crust where the
movement starts is called the focus. The place on the
surface above the focus is called the epicentre.
Vibrations travel outwards from the epicentre as waves.
Greatest damage is usually closest to the epicentre and
the strength of the earthquake decreases away from
the centre.

An earthquake is
measured with a
machine called a
seismograph. The
magnitude of the
earthquake is
measured on the
Richter scale. An
earthquake of 2.0 or
less can be felt only a
little. An earthquake
over 5.0 can cause
damage from things
falling. A 6.0 or
higher magnitude is
considered very
strong and 7.0 is
classified as a major
earthquake.

EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS
Where to take shelter during an earthquake —
Safe Spot – Under a kitchen counter, table or desk,
against an inside corner or wall.
Stay Away from – Fire places, areas around chimneys,
windows that shatter including mirrors and picture
frames.
Be Prepared – Spread awareness amongst your friends
and family members and face any disaster confidently.

Do you know?
MAJOR LAND FORMS
The landscape is being continuously worn away by two
processes – weathering and erosion. Weathering is the
breaking up of the rocks on the earth’s surface. Erosion
is the wearing away of the landscape by different agents
like water, wind and ice. The eroded material is carried
away or transported by water, wind, etc. and eventually
deposited. This process of erosion and deposition create
different landforms on the surface of the earth.
Work of a River
The running water in the river erodes the landscape. When
the river tumbles at steep angle over very hard rocks or
down a steep valley side it forms a waterfall (Fig. 3.4).
•  There are
thousands of small
waterfalls in the
world. The highest
waterfall is Angel
Falls of Venezuela
in South America.
The other waterfalls
are Niagara falls
located on the
border between
Canada and USA in
North America and
Victoria Falls on
the borders of
Zambia and
Zimbabwe in Africa.
The Niagra falls

Softer rock undercut

Fig. 3.4: Waterfall
As the river enters the plain it twists and turns forming
large bends known as meanders. Due to continuous
erosion and deposition along the sides of the meander,
the ends of the meander loop come closer
and closer. In due course of time the
meander loop cuts off from the river and
forms a cut-off lake, also called an ox-bow
lake. At times the river overflows its banks.
This leads to the flooding of the
neighbouring areas. As it floods, it
deposits layers of fine soil and other
material called sediments along its
banks. This leads to the formation
of a flat fertile floodplain. The raised
banks are called levees. As the river
approaches the sea, the speed of the
flowing water decreases and the
2018-19
16
OUR ENVIRONMENT
river begins to break up
into a number of streams
called distributaries. The
river becomes so slow that
it begins to deposit its load.
Each distributary forms its
own mouth. The collection
of sediments from all the
mouths forms a delta.
Work of Sea Waves
The erosion and deposition of
the sea waves gives rise to
coastal landforms. Seawaves
continuously strike at the
rocks. Cracks develop. Over
time they become larger and
wider. Thus, hollow like caves
are formed on the rocks. They
are called sea caves. As these
cavities become bigger and
bigger only the roof of the
caves remain, thus forming sea
arches. Further, erosion
breaks the roof and only walls
are left. These wall like features are called stacks.
The steep rocky coast rising almost vertically above
sea water is called sea cliff. The sea waves deposit
sediments along the shores forming beaches.
Work of Ice
Glaciers are “rivers of ice” which
too erode the landscape by
bulldozing soil and stones to
expose the solid rock below.
Glaciers carve out deep hollows
there. As the ice melts they get
filled up with water and become
beautiful 
lakes 
in 
the
mountains. The material carried
by the glacier such as rocks big
and small, sand and silt gets
deposited. These deposits form
glacial moraines.

Work of wind
Have you ever visited a desert? Try to collect some
pictures of sand dunes.
An active agent of erosion and deposition in the deserts
is wind. In deserts you can see rocks in the shape of a
mushroom, commonly called mushroom rocks. Winds
erode the lower section of the rock more than the upper
part. Therefore, such rocks have narrower base and wider
top. When the wind blows, it lifts and transports sand
from one place to another. When it stops blowing the
sand falls and gets deposited in low hill – like structures.
These are called sand dunes (Fig. 3.9). When the grains
of sand are very fine and light, the wind can carry it over
very long distances. When such sand is deposited in
large areas, it is called loess. Large deposits of loess is
found in China.

Our earth is surrounded by a huge blanket of air
called atmosphere. All living beings on this earth
depend on the atmosphere for their survival. It
provides us the air we breathe and protects us from
the harmful effects of the sun’s rays. Without this
blanket of protection, we would be baked alive by the
heat of the sun during day and get frozen during
night. So it is this mass of air that has made the
temperature on the earth liveable.
COMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE
Do you know that the air we take in while breathing is
actually a mixture of many gases? Nitrogen and oxygen
are two gases which make up the bulk of the
atmosphere. Carbon
dioxide, 
helium,
ozone, argon and
hydrogen are found
in lesser quantities.
Apart from these
gases, tiny dust
particles are also
present in the air. The
pie chart gives you the
percentage of different
constituents of air (Fig. 4.1).
Nitrogen is the most
plentiful gas in the air. When
we inhale, we take some
amount of nitrogen into our
lungs and exhale it. But
plants need nitrogen for their
survival. They can not take
4 Air

Carbon dioxide
released in the
atmosphere creates a
green house effect by
trapping the heat
radiated from the
earth. It is therefore
called a greenhouse
gas and without it the
earth would have been
too cold to live in.
However, when its
level in the
atmosphere increases
due to factory smoke
or car fumes, the heat
retained increases the
temperature of the
earth. This is called
global warming. This
rise in temperature
causes the snow in
coldest parts of the
world to melt. As a
result the sea level
rises, causing floods in
the coastal areas.
There may be drastic
changes in the climate
of a place leading to
extinction of some
plants and animals in
the long run.
2018-19
nitrogen directly from the air. Bacteria, that live in the
soil and roots of some plants, take nitrogen from the
air and change its form so that plants can use it.
Oxygen is the second most plentiful gas in the air.
Humans and animals take oxygen from the air as they
breathe. Green plants produce oxygen during
photosynthesis. In this way oxygen content in the air
remains constant. If we cut trees then this balance
gets disturbed.
Carbon dioxide is another important gas. Green
plants use carbon dioxide to make their food and
release oxygen. Humans or animals release carbon
dioxide. The amount of carbon dioxide released by
humans or animals seems to be equal to the amount
used by the plants which make a perfect balance.
However, the balance is upset by burning of fuels, such
as coal and oil. They add billions of tons of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere each year. As a result, the
increased volume of carbon dioxide is affecting the
earth’s weather and climate.
Read and Ponder: Is global warming a serious issue in today’s world?
Doyouknow?
When air is heated, it
expands, becomes
lighter and goes up.
Cold air is denser and
heavy. That is why it
tends to sink down.
When hot air rises,
cold air from

rushes there to fill in
the gap. That is how
air circulation takes
place.

OUR ENVIRONMENT
STRUCTURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
Our atmosphere is divided into five layers starting from
the earth’s surface. These are Troposphere,
Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere and
Exosphere (Fig. 4.2).
Troposphere: This layer is the most important layer of
the atmosphere. Its average height is 13 km. The air
we breathe exists here.
Almost all the weather
phenomena like rainfall,
fog and hailstorm occur in
this layer.
Stratosphere: Above the
troposphere lies the
stratosphere. It extends up
to a height of 50 km. This
layer is almost free from
clouds and associated
weather phenomenon,
making conditions most
ideal for flying aeroplanes.
One important feature of
stratosphere is that it
contains a layer of ozone
gas. We have just learnt
how it protects us from
the harmful effect of the
sun rays.
Mesosphere: This is the
third 
layer 
of 
the
atmosphere. It lies above
the stratosphere. It extends
up to the height of 80 km.
Meteorites burn up in
this layer on entering from
the space.
Thermosphere: 
In
thermosphere temperature
rises very rapidly with
increasing 
height.
Ionosphere is a part of this
layer. It extends between

80-400 km. This layer helps in radio transmission. In
fact, radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected
back to the earth by this layer.
Exosphere: The upper most layer of the atmosphere
is known as exosphere. This layer has very thin air.
Light gases like helium and hydrogen float into the
space from here.
WEATHER AND CLIMATE
“Is it going to rain today?” “Will it be bright and sunny
today?” How many times have we heard this from
anxious cricket fans speculating the fate of a One Day
match? If we imagine our body to be a radio and the
mind its speaker, weather is something that fiddles
with its control knobs. Weather is this hour-to-hour,
day to day condition of the atmosphere. A hot or humid
weather may make one irritable. A pleasant, breezy
weather may make one cheerful and even plan for an
outing. Weather can change dramatically from day to
day. However, the average weather condition of a place
for a longer period of time represents the climate of a
place. Now do you understand why we have daily
weather forecasts.
Temperature
The temperature you feel everyday
is the temperataure of the
atmosphere. The degree of hotness
and coldness of the air is known
as temperature.
The 
temperature 
of 
the
atmosphere changes not only
between day and night but also
from season to season. Summers
are hotter than winters.
An important factor that
influences the distribution of
temperature is insolation.
Insolation is the incoming solar
energy intercepted by the earth.
The amount of insolation
decreases from the equator
towards the poles. Therefore, the

OUR ENVIRONMENT
temperature decreases in the same manner. Now do
you understand why poles are covered with snow? If
the earth’s temperature rises too high, it would become
too warm for some crops to grow. Temperature in cities
is much higher than that of villages. The concrete and
metals in buildings and the asaphalt of roads get
heated up during the day. This heat is released during
the night.
Also, the crowded high rise buildings of the cities
trap the warm air and thus raise the temperature of
the cities.
Air Pressure
You will be surprised to know that air above us presses
us with a great force on our bodies. However, we don’t
even feel it. This is because the air presses us from all
directions and our body exerts a counter pressure.
Air pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by the
weight of air on the earth’s surface. As we go up the
layers of atmosphere, the pressure falls rapidly. The air
pressure is highest at sea level and decreases with height.
Horizontally the distribution of air pressure is influenced
by temperature of air at a given place. In areas where
temperature is high the air gets heated and rises. This
creates a low-pressure area. Low pressure is associated
with cloudy skies and wet weather.
In areas having lower temperature, the air is cold. It
is therefore heavy. Heavy air sinks and creates a high
pressure area. High pressure is associated with clear and
sunny skies.
The air always moves from high pressure areas to low
pressure areas.
Wind
The movement of air from high pressure area to low
pressure areas is called wind. You can see wind at work
as it blows dry leaves down the pavement or uproots
trees during a storm. Sometimes when the wind blows
gently you can even see it blowing away smoke or fine
dust. At times wind can be so strong that it is difficult
to walk against it. You must have experienced it is not
easy to hold an umbrella on a windy day. Think of
some other examples when strong winds have created

CYCLONE – NATURE’S FURY
Odisha, located on the eastern
seacoast of India is prone to
cyclones that originate in the
Bay of Bengal. On 17-18
October 1999, cyclone hit five
districts of the state. Another
supercyclone occurred on the
29 
October 
1999, 
that
devastated large portions of the
state. The damages caused
were mainly due to three
factors: wind velocity, rain and
tidal surge. The winds of upto
260 km. per hour lasted for over 36 hours. These high velocity winds
uprooted trees and damaged the kutcha houses. Roof tops of several
industrial sheds and other houses were also blown away. Power supply
and telecom lines snapped completely. Heavy rain occurred under the
influence of the cyclone for three days continuously. These rains led to
flooding in the major rivers of Odisha. The cyclonic winds caused tidal
waves that swept 20 km. inland and brought massive destruction to the
coastal areas. The 7 to 10 m high tidal wave intruded suddenly and
caused massive damage to the standing paddy crops.

problems for you. Winds can be
broadly divided into three types.
1. Permanent winds – The trade
winds, westerlies and easterlies
are the permanent winds.
These 
blow 
constantly
throughout the year in a
particular direction.
2. Seasonal winds – These
winds change their direction
in different seasons. For
example monsoons in India.
3. Local winds – These blow
only during a particular
period of the day or year in a
small area. For example, land
and sea breeze. Do you recall the
hot and dry local wind of northern
planes of India? It is called loo.

OUR ENVIRONMENT
The cyclone originated as a “depression” in the Gulf of Thailand,
near east of Port Blair, on 25 October 1999 and gradually moved in a
northwestward direction. It intensified into a supercyclone and hit the area
between Erasama and Balikuda in Odisha on 29 October at 10.30 a.m.
The supercyclone swept the entire coast of Odisha including the
cities of Bhubaneshwar and Cuttack and 28 coastal towns. About 13
million people were affected. A large number of livestock were killed.
Standing crops of paddy, vegetables and fruits were heavily damaged.
Due to salinisation caused by tidal surge, large tracts of agricultural
land have turned infertile. Large tracts of sal, teak and bamboo
plantations have disappeared. The mangrove forests between Paradeep
and Konark vanished.
Moisture
When water evaporates from land and different
water bodies, it becomes water vapour. Moisture
in the air at any time, is known as humidity.
When the air is full of water vapour we call it a
humid day. As the air gets warmer, its capacity
to hold the water vapour increases and so it
becomes more and more humid. On a humid
day, clothes take longer to dry and sweat from
our body does not evaporate easily, making us
feel very uncomfortable.
When the water vapour rises, it starts cooling.
The water vapour condenses causing formation
of droplets of water. Clouds are just masses of
such water droplets. When these droplets of water
become too heavy to float in air, then they come
down as precipitation.
Jet planes flying in the sky leave a white trail
behind them. The moisture from their engines
condenses. We see trails of this condensed
moisture for some time when there is no air
movement to disturb it.
Precipitation that comes down to the earth
in liquid form is called rain. Most of the ground
water comes from rainwater. Plants help preserve
water. When trees on hill sides are cut, rainwater
flows down the bare mountains and can cause
flooding of low lying areas. On the basis of
mechanism, there are three types of rainfall: the
convectional rainfall, the orographic rainfall and
the cyclonic rainfall (Fig. 4.5).

When you think of water, what images come to your
mind? You think of rivers, the waterfalls, the pitter patter
of raindrops, water in your taps... Children love to float
paper boats in rain puddles. By noon the puddles vanish.
Where does the water go?
The sun’s heat causes evaporation of water into
vapour. When the water vapour cools down, it condenses
and forms clouds. From there it may fall on the land or
sea in the form of rain, snow or sleet.
The process by which water continually changes its
form and circulates between oceans,
atmosphere and land is known
as the water cycle (Fig 5.1).
Our earth is like a
terrarium. The same water
that existed centuries ago
still exists today. The

Waves
When you are playing throw ball on the beach and the
ball falls into the water, what happens? It is fun to watch
how the ball gets washed
back to the shore by the
waves. When the water on the
surface of the ocean rises and
falls alternately, they are
called waves.
Doyouknow?
Tsunami is a
Japanese word that
means “Harbour
waves” as the
harbours get
destroyed whenever
there is tsunami.
TSUNAMI – THE EARTH’S PANDEMONIUM
Tsunami or the harbour wave struck havoc in the Indian Ocean on the
26 December 2004. The wave was the result of the earthquake that had
its epicenter close to the western boundary of Sumatra. The magnitude
of the earthquake was 9.0 on the Richter scale. As the Indian plate
went under the Burma plate, there was a sudden movement of the sea
floor, causing the earthquake. The ocean floor was displaced by about
10 – 20m and tilted in a downwardly direction. A huge mass of ocean
water flowed to fill in the gap that was being created by the displacement.
This marked the withdrawal of the water mass from the coastlines of
the landmasses in the south and southeast Asia. After thrusting of the
Indian plate below the Burma plate, the water mass rushed back towards
the coastline. Tsunami travelled at a speed of about 800km. per hour,
comparable to speed of commercial aircraft and completely washed away
Doyouknow?
Waves are formed
when winds scrape
across the ocean
surface. The stronger
the wind blows, the
bigger the wave
becomes.
Fig. 5.4: Waves
During a storm, the winds blowing at very high speed
form huge waves. These may cause tremendous
destruction. An earthquake, a volcanic eruption or
underwater landslides can shift large amounts of ocean
water. As a result a huge tidal wave called tsunami, that
may be as high as 15m., is formed. The largest tsunami
ever measured was 150m. high. These waves travel at a
speed of more than 700 km. per hour. The tsunami of
2004 caused wide spread damage in the coastal areas of
India. The Indira point in the Andaman and Nicobar
islands got submerged after the tsunami.

some of the islands in the Indian ocean. The Indira point in the Andaman
and Nicobar islands that marked the southernmost point of India got
completely submerged. As the wave moved from earthquake epicenter
from Sumatra towards the Andaman islands and Sri Lanka the wave
length decreased with decreasing depth of water. The travel speed also
declined from 700-900km. per hour to less than 70km. per hour. Tsunami
waves travelled upto a depth of 3 km. from the coast killing more than
10,000 people and affected more than lakh of houses. In India, the
worst affected were the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,
Kerala, Puducherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
While the earthquake cannot be predicted in advance, it is possible
to give a three-hour notice of a potential tsunami. Such early warning
systems are in place across the Pacific ocean, but not in the Indian
Ocean. Tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean as the seismic activity
is less as compared to the Pacific.
Destruction caused by tsunami on Tamil Nadu Coast
The tsunami that ravaged the South and South east Asian coasts in
December 2004, is the most devastating tsunami in the last several
hundred years. The large damage caused to life and property was
primarily a result of lack of monitoring, the early warning systems and
knowledge among the coast dwellers of Indian ocean.
The first indication that tsunami is approaching is the rapid
withdrawal of water from the coastal region, followed by destructive
wave. When this happened on the coast, instead of people going to high
ground, they started assembling at the coast to view the miracle. As a
consequence there was a large casualty of curious onlookers when the
gigantic wave (tsunami) struck.
Tides
The rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water twice in a
day is called a tide. It is high tide when water covers
much of the shore by rising to its highest level. It is
low tide when water falls to its lowest level and recedes
from the shore.
2018-19

OUR ENVIRONMENT
The strong gravitational pull
exerted by the sun and the moon
on the earth’s surface causes the
tides. The water of the earth closer
to the moon gets pulled under
the influence of the moon’s
gravitational force and causes high
tide. During the full moon and new
moon days, the sun, the moon and
the earth are in the same line and
the tides are highest. These tides
are called spring tides. But when
the moon is in its first and last
quarter, the ocean waters get drawn
in diagonally opposite directions by
the gravitational pull of sun and
moon resulting in low tides. These
tides are called neap tides (Fig. 5.5).
High tides help in navigation.
They raise the water level close to
the shores. This helps the ships to
arrive at the harbour more easily.
The high tides also help in fishing.
Many more fish come closer to the
shore during the high tide. This enables fishermen
to get a plentiful catch. The rise and fall of water due
to tides is being used to generate electricity in
some places.
OCEAN CURRENTS
Ocean currents are streams of water flowing constantly
on the ocean surface in definite directions. The ocean
currents may be warm or cold (Fig. 5.6). Generally,
the warm ocean currents originate near the equator
and move towards the poles. The cold currents carry
water from polar or higher latitudes to tropical or lower
latitudes. The Labrador Ocean current is cold current
while the Gulf Stream is a warm current. The ocean
current influence the temperature conditions of the
area. Warm currents bring about warm temperature
over land surface. The areas where the warm and cold
currents meet provide the best fishing grounds of the

Natural Vegetation
and Wild Life
Salima was excited about the summer camp she was
attending. She had gone to visit Manali  in Himachal
Pradesh along with her class mates. She recalled how
surprised she was to see the changes in the landform
and natural vegetation as the bus climbed higher and
higher. The deep jungles of the foothills comprising sal
and teak slowly disappeared. She could see tall trees
with thin pointed leaves and cone shaped canopies on
the mountain slopes. She learnt that those were coniferous
trees. She noticed blooms of bright flowers on tall trees.
These were the rhododendrons. From Manali as she was
travelling up to Rohtang pass she saw that the land was
covered with short grass and snow in some  places.
From 
Salima’s
observations, we surmise
that there is a close
relationship 
between
height of land and the
character of vegetations.
With the change in height,
the climate changes and
that changes natural
vegetation. The growth of
vegetation depends on
temperature and moisture. It also depends on factors
like slope and thickness of soil.
The type and thickness of natural vegetation varies
from place to place because of the variation in these factors.
Natural vegetation is generally classified in to three
broad categories as follows:
(a) Forests: Which grow where temperature and rainfall
are plentiful to support a tree cover. Depending upon
these factors, dense and open forests are grown.
Let’s do
Now can you tell why
Salima saw changes
in the natural
vegetation as she
climbed higher and
higher? What types of
vegetations did she
see in the Himalayas
starting with the
foothills and going to
the higher altitudes?
Let’s do
• Like Salima, when
you go to visit any
new place, notice
the type of natural
vegetation occurring
there and try to
think of factors
responsible for the
growth of such
vegetation in that
habitat.
• Note down if any
human interference
has taken place in
that area in terms
of deforestation,
grazing, cultivation
of cash crops,
constructional
activities etc.

Salima was sharing her experience of Himalayan trip
with her father. Her father visited various places in the
world. He told Salima about his observations of the variety
of vegetation in different parts of  different continents.He
mentioned about coniferous forests in the sub polar
regions, thorny bushes in the deserts, thick tropical
hardwood forest in the humid regions and many more.
Salima realised the Himalayas have almost all variety of
vegetation which one can see while moving from the
equator to the polar region.
The changes in the type of natural vegetation occur
mainly because of the changes of climatic condition. Let
us get to know the different types of natural vegetation
of the world with their characteristic features and wildlife
inhabiting there.
FORESTS
Tropical Evergreen Forests
These forests are also called  tropical rainforests
(Fig. 6.3). These thick forests occur in the regions near
the equator and close to the tropics. These regions are
hot and receive heavy rainfall throughout the year. As
there is no particular dry season, the trees do not shed
their leaves altogether. This is the reason they are
called evergreen. The thick canopies of the closely
spaced trees do not allow the sunlight to penetrate
inside the forest even in the day time. Hardwood trees
like rosewood, ebony, mahogany are common here.

Tropical Deciduous Forests
Tropical deciduous are the monsoon forests  found in
the large part of India,northern Australia and in central
America (Fig. 6.4).These regions experience  seasonal
changes. Trees shed their leaves in the dry  season  to
conserve water. The hardwood trees found in these
forests are sal, teak, neem and shisham. Hardwood trees
are extremely useful for making furniture, transport
and constructional materials. Tigers, lions, elephants,
langoors and monkeys are the common animals of these
regions (Fig. 6.5, 6.6 and 6.8).

Temperate Evergreen Forests
The temperate evergreen forests are located in the mid-
latitudinal coastal region (Fig. 6.7). They are commonly
found along the eastern margin of the continents, e.g., In
south east USA, South China and in South East Brazil.
They comprise both hard and soft wood trees like oak,
pine, eucalyptus, etc.

Temperate Deciduous Forests
As we go towards higher latitudes, there are more
temperate deciduous forests (Fig. 6.11). These are found
in the north eastern part of USA, China, New Zealand,
Chile and also found in the coastal regions of Western
Europe. They shed their leaves in the dry season. The
common trees are oak, ash, beech, etc. Deer, foxes, wolves
are the animals commonly found. Birds like pheasants,
monals are also found here (Fig. 6.9 and 6.10).
Do you know?
• Mediterranean trees
adapt themselves to
dry summers with
the help of their
thick barks and wax
coated leaves which

You have learnt that most  of the east and north east
margins of the continents are covered by temperate
evergreen and deciduous trees. The west and south west
margins of the continents are different. They have
Mediterranean vegetation (Fig. 6.12). It is mostly found
in the areas around the Mediterranean sea in Europe,
Africa and Asia, hence the name. This kind of vegetation
is also found outside the actual Mediterranean region in
California in the USA, south west Africa, south western

are marked for hot dry summers and mild rainy winters.
Citrus fruits such as oranges, figs, olives and grapes are
commonly cultivated here because people have removed
the natural vegetation in order to cultivate what they
want to. There isn’t much wildlife here.
Coniferous Forests
In the higher latitudes (50° – 70°) of Northern
hemisphere the spectacular Coniferous forests are found
(Fig. 6.13 a and b). These are also called as Taiga. These
forests are also seen in the higher altitudes. These  are
the trees which Salima found in the Himalayas in
abundance. They are tall, softwood evergreen trees. The
woods of these trees are very useful for making pulp,
which is used for manufacturing paper and newsprint.
Match boxes and packing boxes are also made from
softwood. Chir, pine, cedar are the important variety of
trees in these forests. Silver fox, mink, polar bear are
the common animals found here.

GRASSLANDS
Tropical grasslands: These occur on
either side of the equator and extend till the
tropics (Fig. 6.14). This vegetation grows in
the areas of moderate to low amount of
rainfall. The grass can grow very tall, about
3 to 4 metres in height. Savannah grasslands
of Africa are of this type. Elephants, zebras,
giraffes, deer, leopards are common in
tropical grasslands (Fig. 6.15).

Temperate grasslands: These are found in the mid-
latitudinal zones and in the interior part of the
continents. Usually, grass here is short and
nutritious.Wild buffaloes, bisons, antilopes are common
in the temperate region.
Thorny bushes: These are found in the dry desert like
regions.Tropical deserts are located on the western
margins of the continents. The vegetation cover is scarce
here because of scanty rain and scorching heat. Identify
the desert regions in the world map. Can you name the
great desert of India? Name some of the common animals
of the desert which you have learnt earlier.
If you reach the polar region you will find the place
extremely cold. The growth of natural vegetation is very
limited here. Only mosses, lichens and very small shrubs
are found here. It grows during the very short summer.
This is called Tundra type of vegetation. This vegetation
is found in the polar areas of Europe, Asia and North
America. The animals have thick fur and thick skin to
protect themselves from the cold climatic conditions. Seal,
walruses, muREMOVEDoxen, Arctic owl, Polar bear and snow
foxes are some of the animals found here (Fig. 6.16).
Salima’s father showed her some photographs of thick
forests. In some of the photographs, Salima observed
that people were cutting trees and clearing the forests.
Her father explained that the local
people wanted their land for
agriculture and settlements, so
they cleared up the forests.
Salima started wondering if all
forests are cleared, then where
will the wild life go? Will the forest
take its original shape again? If
people go on cutting the trees like
this, will there be enough oxygen,
water vapour, timber, fruits, nuts
available in future?

In Chapter 1 you have learnt that early human beings
depended entirely on nature for food, clothing and
shelter; but with time they learnt new skills to grow food,
build homes and develop better means of transport and
communication. In this way they modified the
environment where they lived.
Settlements are places where people build their
homes. Early human beings lived on trees and in caves.
When they started to grow crops it became necessary to
have a permanent home. The settlements grew near the
river valleys as water was available and land was fertile.
With the development of trade, commerce and
manufacturing, human settlements became larger.
Settlement flourished and civilizations developed near
river valleys. Do you recall the names of civilization that
grew along the banks of rivers Indus, Tigris, Nile and
Hwang-He.
Settlements 
can 
be
permanent or temporary.
Settlements 
which 
are
occupied for a short time
are 
called 
temporary
settlements. The people
living in deep forests, hot and
cold deserts and mountains
often dwell in such temporary
settlements. They practice
hunting, gathering, shifting
cultivation and transhumance.
However more and more
settlements 
today 
are
permanent settlements. In
these settlements, people
build homes to live in.

The place where a
building or a
settlement develops is

conditions for
selection of an ideal
site are-

It was Mary’s birthday party. She and her friends
were waiting for Gurpreet to arrive so that Mary could
cut the cake. At last Gurpreet arrived- tired, coughing
and wheezing.  She explained that the traffic jam was
terrible. Mary’s mother Mrs.Thomas patted Gurpreet’s
back and sighed, “Oof! The pollution in our city!” Prasad
had recently come from his village. He asked, “Why do
we have such traffic jams and such pollution in the
cities?” “The number of vehicles is increasing day by
day due to the growing population in the cities”, Mary’s
father, Mr. Thomas replied. Mary asked, “Then why
are people coming to the cities?” Her mother replied,
“They come looking for jobs, better education and
medical facilities.” Mary further enquired, “If so many
people keep coming to cities, where will all the people
live?” Mr. Thomas said, “That is why you see so many
slums and squatter settlements where people stay in
congested and unhygienic conditions. Shortage of
power and water supply are common problems in the
cities”. Prasad said, “Our villages may not have big
cinema halls, well-equipped schools and good hospitals,
but we have lot of open spaces and fresh air to breathe
in. When my grandfather was sick we
had to rush him to the city hospital.”
From the above conversation we
can identify two different pictures of
settlements – the rural and the urban
settlements. The villages are rural
settlement where people are engaged
in activities like agriculture, fishing,
forestry, crafts work and trading etc.
Rural settlements can be compact or
scattered. A compact settlement is a
closely built area of dwellings,
wherever flat land is available
(Fig. 7.2). In a scattered settlement
dwellings are spaced over an
extensive area. This type of settlement
is mostly found in hilly tracts, thick
forests, and regions of extreme
climate (Fig. 7.3).
In rural areas, people build houses
to suit their environment. In regions

Places 
where 
water
accumulates in the rainy season the
houses are constructed on a raised
platform or stilts (Fig. 7.4).
Thick mud walled houses with
thatched roofs are very common in
areas of hot climate. Local materials
like stones, mud, clay, straw etc are
used to construct houses.
The towns are small and the cities
are larger urban settlements. In
urban areas the people are engaged in manufacturing,
trading, and services. Name some of the villages, towns
and cities of your state.
TRANSPORT
Transport is the means by which people and goods
move. In the early days it took a great deal of time, to
travel long distances. People had to walk and used
animals to carry their goods. Invention of the wheel
made transport easier. With the passage of time
different means of transport developed but even today
people use animals for transport (Fig. 7.5).

In our country donkeys, mules, bullocks and camels
are common. In the Andes Mountains of South
America, llamas are used, as are yaks in Tibet. The
early traders from other countries used to take several
months to reach India. They took either the sea route
or the land route. Aeroplanes have made travel faster.
Now it takes only 6-8 hours to travel from India to
Europe. Modern means of transport thus saves time
and energy.

OUR ENVIRONMENT
 The four major means of transport are roadways,
railways, waterways and airways.
ROADWAYS
The most commonly used means of transport especially
for short distances are roads. They can be metalled
(pucca) and unmetalled (kutcha) (Fig. 7.6 and 7.7). The
plains have a dense network of roads. Roads have also
been build in terrains like deserts, forests and even high
mountains.  Manali-Leh highway in the Himlayan
Mountains is one of the highest roadways in the world.
Roads built underground are called subways/under
paths. Flyovers are built over raised structures.
Fig. 7.6: Metalled Road
Fig. 7.7: Unmetalled Road
RAILWAYS
The railways carry heavy goods and
people over long distances quickly and
cheaply. The invention of the steam
engine and the Industrial Revolution
helped in speedy development of rail
transport. Diesel and electric engines
have largely replaced the steam
engines. In places super fast trains
have been introduced to make the
journey faster. The railway network
is well developed over the plain areas.
Advanced technological skills have
enabled laying of railway lines in
difficult mountain terrains also. But
these are much fewer in number. Indian railway network
is well developed. It is the largest in Asia.

Do you know?
WATERWAYS
You have already learnt that since early days waterways
were used for transportation. Waterways are the
cheapest for carrying heavy and bulky goods over long
distances. They are mainly of two types – inland
waterways and sea routes.
Navigable rivers and lakes are used as inland
waterways. Some of the important inland waterways are
the Ganga-Brahmaputra river system, the Great Lakes
in North America and the river Nile in Africa.
Sea routes and oceanic routes are mostly
used for transporting merchandise and
goods from one country to another. These
routes are connected with the ports. Some
of the important ports of the world are
Singapore and Mumbai in Asia, New York,
Los Angeles in North America, Rio de
Janerio in South America, Durban and
Cape Town in Africa, Sydney in Australia,
London and Rotterdam in Europe (Fig. 7.11).
Can you name some more ports of the world?

AIRWAYS
This is the fastest way of transport developed in the early
twentieth century. It is also the most expensive due to
high cost of fuels. Air traffic is adversely affected by bad
weather like fog and storms. It is the only mode of
transport to reach the most remote and distant areas
especially where there are no roads and railways.
Helicopters are extremely useful in most inaccessible
areas and in time of calamities for rescuing people and
distributing food, water, clothes and medicines (Fig. 7.9).
Some of the important airports are Delhi, Mumbai, New
York, London, Paris, Frankfurt and Cairo (Fig. 7.11).
COMMUNICATION
Communication is the process of conveying messages to
others. With the development of technology humans have
devised new and fast modes of communication. The Fig.
7.10 explains the evolution of the communication system.
The advancement in the field of communication has
brought about an information revolution in the world.
Different modes of communication are used to provide
information, to educate as well as to entertain. Through
newspapers, radio and television we can communicate
with a large number of people. They are therefore called
mass media. The satellites have made communication
even faster. Satellites have helped in oil exploration,
survey of forest, underground water, mineral wealth,
weather forecast and disaster warning. Now we can send
electronic mails or e-mails through Internet. Wireless
telephonic communications through cellular phones
have become very popular today. Internet not
only provides us with worldwide information
and interaction but has also made our lives
more comfortable. Now we
can reserve tickets for railways,
airways and even cinemas and
hotels sitting at home.

In Chapters 8, 9 and 10, you will learn about the life
of people in the different natural regions of the world.
LIFE IN THE AMAZON BASIN
Before learning about the Amazon basin, let us look at the
map (Fig. 8.2). Notice that the tropical region lies very
close to the equator; between 10°N and 10°S. So, it is referred
to as the equatorial region. The river Amazon flows through
this region. Notice how it flows from the mountains to the
west and reaches the Atlantic Ocean to the east.
The place where a river flows into another body of
water is called the river’s mouth. Numerous tributaries
join the Amazon River to form the Amazon basin. The
river basin drains portions of Brazil, parts of Peru, Bolivia,
Ecuador, Columbia and a small part of Venezuela.
Name the countries of the basin through which the
equator passes.
Tributaries: These
are small rivers that
join the main river.
The main river along
with all its tributaries
that drain an area
forms a river basin or
the catchment area.
The Amazon Basin is
the largest river basin
in the world.

CLIMATE
As you now know, the Amazon Basin stretches directly
on the equator and is characterized by hot and wet climate
throughout the year. Both day and nights are almost
equally hot and humid. The skin feels sticky. It rains
almost everyday, that too without much warning. The
day temperatures are high with very high humidity. At
night the temperature goes down but the humidity
remains high.
RAINFORESTS
As it rains heavily in this region, thick forests
grow (Fig. 8.3). The forests are in fact so thick
that the dense “roof” created by leaves and
branches does not allow the sunlight to reach
the ground. The ground remains dark and damp.
Only shade tolerant vegetation may grow here.
Orchids, bromeliads grow as plant parasites.
The rainforest is rich in
fauna. Birds such as toucans (Fig. 8.4),
humming birds, bird of paradise with
their brilliantly coloured plumage,
oversized bills for eating make them
different from birds we commonly see
in India. These birds also make loud
sounds in the forests. Animals like
monkeys, sloth and ant-eating tapirs
are found here (Fig. 8.5). Various species of reptiles and
snakes also thrive in these jungles. Crocodiles, snakes,
pythons abound. Anaconda and boa constrictor are
some of the species. Besides, the basin is home to
thousands of species of
insects. Several species of
fishes including the flesh-
eating Piranha fish is also
found in the river. This basin
is thus extraordinarily rich in
the variety of life found there.
PEOPLE OF THE RAINFORESTS
People grow most of their food in small areas after clearing
some trees in the forest. While men hunt and fish along
the rivers, women take care of the crops. They mainly grow

Fig. 8.6: Gradual Destruction of Forests
Doyouknow?
Slash and Burn is a
way of cultivating land
where farmers clear a
piece of land by
slashing or cutting
down trees and bushes.
These are then burnt,
which releases the
nutrients into the soil.
Now crops are grown in
this cleared field for a
few years.
After repeatedly
using the patch of
land, the soil looses
its nutrients. So it is
abandoned. Then they
clear another plot of
land to plant. In the
mean time young
trees grow in the old
field. In this way soil
fertility is restored.
People can then
return to it and start
cultivating it again.
tapioca, pineapple and sweet potato. As hunting and fishing
are uncertain it is the women who keep their families alive
by feeding them the vegetables they grow. They practice
“slash and burn agriculture”. The staple food is manioc,
also known as cassava that grows under the ground like
the potato. They also eat queen ants and egg sacs. Cash
crops like coffee, maize and cocoa are also grown.
The rainforests provide a lot of wood for the houses.
Some families live in thatched houses shaped like
beehives. There are other large apartment-like houses
called “Maloca” with a steeply slanting roof.
Life of the people of the Amazon basin is slowly
changing. In the older days the heart of the forest, could
be reached only by navigating the river. In 1970 the Trans
Amazon highway made all parts of the rainforest
accessible. Aircrafts and helicopters are also used for
reaching various places. The indigenous population was
pushed out from the area and forced to settle in new
areas where they continued to practice their distinctive
way of farming.
The developmental activities are leading to the gradual
destruction of the biologically diverse rainforests. It is
estimated that a large area of the
rainforest has been disappearing
annually in the Amazon basin.
You can see that this
destruction of forests has
a much wider implication
(Fig. 8.6). The topsoil is
washed away as the
rains fall and the

turns into
a barren
landscape.

The basin area has varied topography. The
environment plays a dominant role in the distribution
of the population. The mountain areas with steep slopes
have inhospitable terrain. Therefore less number of
people live in the mountain area of the Ganga-
Brahmaputra basin. The plain area provides the most
suitable land for human habitation. The soil is fertile.
Agriculture is the main occupation of the people where
flat land is available to grow crops. The density of
population of the plains is very high. The main crop is
paddy (Fig. 8.9). Since cultivation of paddy requires
sufficient water, it is grown in the areas where the amount
of rainfall is high.
Wheat, maize, sorghum, gram and millets are the
other crops that are grown. Cash crops like sugarcane
and jute are also grown. Banana plantations are seen in
some areas of the plain. In West Bengal and Assam tea is
grown in plantations (Fig. 8.10). Silk is produced through
the cultivation of silk worms in parts of Bihar and Assam.
In the mountains and hills, where the slopes are gentle,
crops are grown on terraces.
The vegetation cover of the area varies according to

Activity.
Collect under mentioned material and observe how destruction of trees effect
the soil cover.
Material
(i) Three small flowerpots or food cans (e.g., cold drinks tin cans),
(ii) one big can with holes punched in the bottom (this will act as a
sprinkling can),
(iii) twelve coins or bottle caps
(iv) soil.
Steps
Take three small cans or pots. Fill them with soil till the top. Press the soil to
make it level with the top of the can. Now put four coins or bottle caps on the
soil of each can. Take the big can that has been punched with holes and fill it
with water. You can also take the sprinkling can from your garden. Now, sprinkle
water on the three cans. On the first can sprinkle water very slowly so that no
soil splashes out. Let moderate amount of water be sprinkled on the second
can. On the third can, sprinkle the water heavily. You will observe that
unprotected soil splashes out. Where the ‘rain’ is heavy the amount of soil that
splashes out is the maximum and least in case of the first can. The coins or
caps represent the tree covers. It is clear that if the land is cleared completely
of the vegetation, the soil cover will quickly disappear.

Just as a forest can be defined as the place where trees
are the main type of vegetation, grassland  can be
defined as a region where grasses form the dominant
type of plant life.  Grasslands make up almost a quarter
of the total land surface.  The types of plants that
grow here greatly depend on what the climate and soil
are like. As climate plays an important role in the
formation of grasslands, it is generally used as a basis
to divide the world’s grasslands into two broad
categories:  those that occur in the temperate region
and those that occur in the tropical regions.
THE PRAIRIES
The temperate grasslands of North America are known
as the Prairies (Fig. 9.1). It is a region of flat, gently
sloping or hilly land. For the most part, prairies are
treeless but, near the low lying plains, flanking river
valleys, woodlands can be found. Tall grass, upto two
metres high, dominates, the landscape. It is actually a
“sea of grass.”
The prairies are bound by the
Rocky Mountains in the West and
the Great Lakes in the East. Look
at the map of North America
(Fig. 9.2). You can see that the
prairies cover parts of United States
of America and parts of Canada. In
the USA, the area is drained by the
tributaries of Mississippi and the
Canadian prairies are drained by
the tributaries of Saskatchewan
Rivers.
Word Origin
The word Prairie
originated from Latin
word priata which
means meadow.

OUR ENVIRONMENT
CLIMATE
Being located in the heart of a continent, the climate is
of continental type with extreme temperatures.
The summers are warm with temperatures of around
20°C, while in winter -20°C has been recorded in
Winnipeg, Canada. In winters a thick blanket of snow
covers this region.
The annual rainfall is moderate and is ideal for the
growth of grass. Due to the absence of the north-south
barrier, a local wind “Chinook” blows here.
Do you know?
Chinook is a hot wind
that blows in winter
and therefore raises
the temperature
within a short time.
This increase in
temperature results
in the melting of
snow, making pasture
land available for
grazing of animals.
Fig. 9.2: The Prairies in North America
Do you know?
The grasslands of
Prairies were the
home of native
Americans often
called “Red Indians”.
They were the actual
habitant of the
continent. The Prairies
were home of other
tribes also like the
Apache, the Crow, the
Cree and the Pawnee.

LIFE IN THE TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS
Glossary
FLORA AND FAUNA
Prairies are practically tree-less. Where water
is available, trees such as willows, alders and
poplars grow. Places that receive rainfall of
over 50 cm, are suitable for farming as the
soil is fertile. Though the major crop of this
area is maize, other crops including potatoes,
soybean, cotton and alfa-alfa is also grown.
Areas where rainfall is very little or unreliable,
grasses are short and sparse.  These areas
are suitable for cattle rearing.  Large cattle
farms called ranches are looked after by
sturdy men called
cowboys (Fig. 9.3). Bison or the
American buffalo is the most
important animal of this region
(Fig. 9.4). It nearly got extinct
due to its indiscriminate hunting
and is now a protected species.
The other animals found in this
region are rabbits, coyotes,
gophers and Prairie dog.
PEOPLE
The people of this region are very hardworking. They
have successfully harnessed technology to utilise their
rich natural resources. Two of the most developed
countries in the world - the USA and Canada are located
in this region.  Scientific methods of cultivation and use
of tractors, harvesters and combines has made North
America a surplus food producer. The Prairies are also
known as the “Granaries of the world,” due to the huge
surplus of wheat production.
Dairy farming is another major industry. The dairy
belt extends from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Coast
in the east. Dairy farming and extensive agriculture both
promote setting up of food processing industries.
Large mineral deposits particularly coal and iron
and a good network of roads, railways and canals in
this region have made it the most industrialised region
in the world.

THE VELDS
The temperate grasslands of South Africa are called the
velds (Fig. 9.5). Velds are rolling plateaus with varying
heights ranging from 600 m to 1100 m. It is bound by
the Drakensburg Mountains on the east. To its west lies
the Kalahari desert. On the northeastern part, “high velds”
are located that attain a height of more than 1600 m, in
some places. Look at the map of Africa. Name the
countries that are covered by the Velds. The tributaries
of rivers Orange and Limpopo drain the region.
Velds lie in the
Southern hemisphere.
When it is summers
in velds, what season
would it be in the
prairies?
Do you know?
The Veld name was
given by the Dutch
settlers before South
Africa was colonised
by the British.
Fig. 9.5: Veld in Africa
CLIMATE
The velds have a mild climate due to the influence of the
Indian Ocean. Winters are cold and dry. Temperatures
vary between 5°C and 10°C and July is the coldest
month. Summers are short and warm. Johannesburg
records about 20°C temperature in the summer.

LIFE IN THE TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS
The velds receive rainfall mainly in the summer months
from November to February. This is mainly because of
the warm ocean currents that wash the shores of the
velds. If the rainfall is scanty in the winter months from
June till August, drought may occur.
FLORA AND FAUNA
The vegetation cover is sparse. Grasses
dominate the landscape. Red grass grows
in bush velds. In the high velds acacia and
maroola are seen to be growing. The animals
of the velds are primarily lions, leopards,
cheetah and kudu (Fig. 9.6).
PEOPLE
Velds are known for cattle rearing and mining. The soils
are not very fertile in the velds due to the presence of
discontinuous grasses exposing barren surface. However
where the land is fertile crops are grown. The main crops
are maize, wheat, barley, oats and potato. Cash crops
like tobacco, sugarcane and cotton are also grown.
Sheep rearing is the most important
occupation of the people. Sheep is bred
mainly for wool and has given rise to the
wool industry in the velds. Merino sheep is
a popular species and their wool is very
warm. Dairy farming is the next important
occupation. Cattle are reared in the warmer
and wetter regions and the dairy products
like butter, cheese are produced for both
domestic supply and also for export.
The velds have rich reserve of minerals.
Iron and steel industry has developed where
coal and iron are present. Gold and diamond
mining are major occupations of people of
this region. Johannesburg is known for being
the gold capital of the world. Kimberley is
famous for its diamond mines (Fig. 9.7).
Mining of diamond and gold in South Africa
led to the establishment of trade ties with
Britain and gradually South Africa became
a British Colony. This mineral rich area has
a well-developed network of transport.

Make a grass whistle
You will require a blade of grass about 5 cm in length. Be sure to choose the
grass blade longer than your thumb. The blade of grass should be fairly thick.
Choose the grass that is broad and wide. Narrow blade is difficult to hold. Put
your thumbs together as your nails are facing you. Stretch the blade of grass
lengthwise between the thumbs and the base of the hand. Your hands should
be cupped to create a hollow or a narrow opening between your palms. You
should just be able to see the edge of the grass only through the narrow opening.
Place your lips over the opening and blow gently into the palm. You may even
feel the grass blade vibrating as you blow. As you gradually blow you will hear
sound of whistle created by grass.

10 Life in the Deserts
In Chapter 5, you have seen that water means life to
plants, animals and people. It is difficult for anyone to
live in places where there is no water to drink, where
there is no grass for their cattle to feed on and where
there is no water to help the crops to grow.
We will now learn about the places in the world where
people have learned to cope with extreme harsh
temperatures; in some places as hot as fire and some as
cold as ice. These are the desert areas of the world. These
are characterised by low rainfall, scanty vegetation and
extreme temperatures. Depending on the temperatures
there can be hot deserts or cold deserts. The people
inhabit these lands wherever little water is available to
practise agriculture.
THE HOT DESERT – SAHARA
Look at the map of the world and the
continent of Africa. Locate the Sahara
desert covering a large part of North
Africa. It is the world’s largest desert. It
has an area of around 8.54 million
sq. km. Do you recall that India has an
area of 3.2 million sq. km? The Sahara
desert touches eleven countries. These
are Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali,
Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Sudan,
Tunisia and Western Sahara.
When you think of a desert the picture
that immediately comes to your mind is that of sand. But
besides the vast stretches of sands, that Sahara desert is
covered with, there are also gravel plains and elevated
plateaus with bare rocky surface. These rocky surfaces
may be more than 2500m high at some places.

Climate
The climate of the Sahara desert is scorching hot and
parch dry. It has a short rainy season. The sky is
cloudless and clear. Here, the moisture evaporates
faster than it accumulates. Days are unbelievably hot.
The temperatures during the day may soar as high as
50°C, heating up the sand and the bare rocks, which
in turn radiates heat making everything around hot.
The nights may be freezing cold with temperatures
nearing zero degrees.

Vegetation in the Sahara desert includes cactus, date
palms and acacia. In some places there are oasis – green
islands with date palms surrounding them. Camels,

Depressions are formed
when the wind blows
away the sands. In the
depressions where
underground water
reaches the surface,
an oasis is formed.
These areas are fertile.
People may settle
around these water
bodies and grow date
palms and other
crops. Sometimes the
oasis may be
abnormally large.
Tafilalet Oasis in
Morocco is a large
oasis with an area of
about 13,000 sq.km.
Fig. 10.3: Oasis in the Sahara Desert
People
The Sahara desert despite its harsh climate has been
inhabited by various groups of people, who pursue
different activities. Among them are the Bedouins and
Tuaregs. These groups are nomadic tribes rearing
livestock such as goats, sheep, camels and horses.
These animals provide them with milk, hides from
which they make leather for belts, slippers, water
bottles; hair is used for mats, carpets, clothes and
blankets. They wear heavy robes as protection against
dust storms and hot winds.
The oasis in the Sahara and the Nile Valley in Egypt
supports settled population. Since water is available, the
people grow date palms. Crops such as rice, wheat, barley
and beans are also grown. Egyptian cotton, famous
worldwide is grown in Egypt.
The discovery of oil – a product in great demand
throughout the world, in Algeria, Libya and Egypt is
constantly transforming the Sahara desert. Other
minerals of importance that are found in the area include
iron, phosphorus, manganese and uranium.
The cultural landscape of the Sahara is undergoing
change. Gleaming glass cased office buildings tower over
mosques and superhighways crisscross the ancient camel
paths. Trucks are replacing camels in the salt trade.
Tuaregs are seen acting as guides to foreign tourists.
More and more nomadic herdsmen are taking to city life
finding jobs in oil and gas operations.

THE COLD DESERT - LADAKH
Ladakh is a cold desert lying in the Great Himalayas,
on the eastern side of Jammu and Kashmir (Fig. 10.4).
The Karakoram Range in the north and the Zanskar
mountains in the south enclose it. Several rivers flow
through Ladakh, Indus being the most important
among them. The rivers form deep valleys and gorges.
Several glaciers are found in Ladakh, for example the
Gangri glacier.
The altitude in Ladakh varies from about 3000m
in Kargil to more than 8,000m in the Karakoram.
Due to its high altitude, the climate is extremely cold
and dry. The air at this altitude is so thin that the
heat of the sun can be felt intensely. The day
temperatures in summer are just above zero degree
and the night temperatures well below –30°C. It is
freezing cold in the winters when the temperatures may
remain below –40°C for most of the time. As it lies

in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, there is little
rainfall, as low as 10 cm every year. The area
experiences freezing winds and burning hot sunlight.
You will be surprised to know that if you sit in the
sun with your feet in the shade, you may suffer from
both sunstroke and frost bite at the same time.
Flora and Fauna
Due to high aridity, the vegetation is sparse. There are
scanty patches of grasses and shrubs for animals to
graze. Groves of willows and poplars are seen in the
valleys. During the summers, fruit trees such as apples,
apricots and walnuts bloom. Several species of birds are
sighted in Ladakh. Robins, redstarts, Tibetan snowcock,
raven and hoopoe are common. Some of these are
migratory birds. The animals of Ladakh are wild goats,
wild sheep, yak and special kinds of dogs. The animals
are reared to provide for the milk, meat and hides. Yak’s
milk is used to make cheese and butter. The hair of the
sheep and goat is used to make woollens.
People
Do you find any resemblance between the people of
Ladakh and the inhabitants of Tibet and Central Asia?
The people here are either Muslims or Buddhists. In
fact several Buddhists monasteries dot the Ladakhi
landscape with their traditional ‘gompas’. Some
famous monasteries are Hemis, Thiksey, Shey and
Lamayuru (Fig. 10.5).
In the summer season the people are busy cultivating
barley, potatoes, peas, beans and turnip. The climate in
winter months is so harsh that
people keep themselves engaged in
festivities and ceremonies. The
women are very hard working. They
work not only in the house and
fields, but also manage small
business and shops. Leh, the capital
of Ladakh is well connected both by
road and air. The National Highway

Desert Game
This is a class room activity involving all the students. The teacher will create a
list of desert creatures. The number of the creatures should be same as the number
of students in the class. The creatures can be picked up from the categories of
mammals, birds and reptiles. Mammals can include – camel, yak, fox, sheep, goat,
antelope…
Birds – raven, eagle, vulture, turkey…
Reptiles – snakes …
Assign one desert creature to each student. Ask the student to write three
characteristics of the creature on plain sheet of paper. (students can use index
cards of size 10 cm × 15 cm). Questions such as - in what type of deserts it is
found? Major adaptation? Use to man?
These characteristics will be used as clues in the guessing game. On the board
make three columns – mammals, birs and reptiles. Paste a sheet of paper in the
column under the particular category. The class can be divided in three to four
groups. They will compete against each other in the ‘desert game’. Each group now
takes turn in guessing the correct answer. Explain to the class that they have to
guess what animal matches the characteristics listed on the paper.
For example:
• Animal of hot desert
• Has double set of eyelashes to keep away the sand
• The hide is used for making water bottles
 The correct answer is ‘camel’. Within the group there will be a student who has
prepared the card. That student should not answer. Ten points are awarded for
the correct answer.
This game will enable students to understand the desert. You can play the
same game by taking different types of fruits, flora and the clothes the people wear.

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s 
life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks 
a departure from the legacy of bookish learning, which continues to shape our 
system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi 
and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this 
basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of 
sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will 
take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education 
outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and 
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and 
to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given 
space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the 
information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as 
the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and 
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we 
perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed 
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. 
Flexibility in the daily timetable is as necessary as rigour in implementing the 
annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days is actually devoted 
to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine 
how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy 
experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have 
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting 
knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and 
the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by 
giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, 
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates 
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this 
book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Social Sciences, 
Professor Hari Vasudevan, the Chief Advisor, Sarada Balagopalan and the Advisor, 
Arvind Sardana for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed 
to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making 
this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have 
generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content 
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises 
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential 
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has 
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. 
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes 
have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of 
the following:
•	 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in 
the same class
•	 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same 
subject
•	 Difficulty level
•	 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much 
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through 
self-learning or peer-learning
•	 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes 
given above.

Introductory note for teachers
There is a substantial difference between 
Civics and Social and Political Life, not only 
in terms of the topics covered but also in the 
pedagogic approaches required in each subject 
area. Keeping these in mind, this Introduction 
attempts to clarify certain aspects of Social and 
Political Life.  
What is Social and Political Life?
Social and Political Life (SPL) is a new subject 
area in middle school social science that has 
replaced the earlier subject of Civics. The National 
Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 strongly 
argues that Civics should be discontinued 
and its focus on government institutions and 
functioning should be tempered in the new 
subject that replaces it. SPL, as its name 
suggests, focuses on topics related to social, 
political and economic life in contemporary 
India. 
What pedagogical 
approach does SPL use? 
SPL’s use of ‘real-life’ situations is a marked 
departure from Civics. SPL uses these real 
situations to teach concepts because it recognises 
that children learn best through concrete 
experiences. It uses material that draws upon 
the experiential understanding of familial and 
social issues that middle school children bring to 
the classroom. SPL further develops the learner’s 
abilities to critically understand and analyse 
these issues in keeping with the tenets of the 
Indian Constitution. 
This pedagogical approach tends to avoid the 
use of definitions to sum up a concept. Instead, 
it uses case studies and narratives to explain 
concepts. The concepts embedded within the 
narratives are made clear through the in-text 
and end-text questions. The aim is to have the 
learner understand the concept through their 
own experiences and write about it in their own 
words. 
This often means that there is seldom one 
‘correct’ answer to the questions posed. However 
there is a wrong answer. Teachers should try 
to gauge whether an answer to a question 
adequately reflects the learner’s understanding 
of the concept being discussed. 
Given that children learn best through 
understanding and applying concepts 
to local realities, can a ‘national’ 
textbook adequately reflect the many 
‘locals’ that make up the nation? 
SPL functions by the pedagogic principle that 
children learn best through an experiential 
understanding of concepts. This poses a 
contradiction when the effort is to write a ‘national’ 
textbook, because a national text can neither 
sufficiently represent all the various aspects 
of the various locals, nor fix the sociocultural 
background of the child for whom the book 
is intended. Therefore, the case studies and 
narratives used in SPL are a mix of rural and 
urban examples in which the assumed learner 
is not easily discernible. 
Case studies and narratives used in SPL 
are a mix of rural and urban examples.

xii
In addition to the important job of 
transacting the text, what crucial role 
does SPL expect teachers to play in 
the classroom?
SPL counts on the teacher to play a very 
significant role in the classroom for the following 
reasons. First, the SPL text specifically names 
communities (for example: Dalit, Muslim, 
poor etc.) in its discussion of various issues 
and this may lead to some discomfort in a 
classroom that has a student population from 
different sociocultural and (perhaps) economic 
backgrounds. We expect the teacher to play a 
crucial role in transacting this material with a 
sensitivity and firm commitment to respecting the 
dignity of all students in the classroom and the 
school. Second, given the limited ability of this 
‘national’ text to engage the local we also envision 
the teacher playing a major role in adding local 
examples to the discussion of concepts, provided 
these remain true to the logic and understanding 
of each concept as intended by the book’s authors.
How does the SPL help the learner 
assimilate the values enshrined in the 
Constitution?
At first glance it might appear to some that unlike 
Civics, SPL’s focus on ‘real’ examples contradicts 
the tenets of the Constitution. Such a focus, 
however, is a technique utilised in SPL in response 
to a critique of Civics textbooks that always only 
discussed the ideal and seldom deliberated upon 
the reality that was very different. Since the 
learner is already aware of such realities, to avoid 
discussing them would make the learning of social 
and political concepts didactic and disconnected. 
Instead, SPL uses this embedded awareness to 
make the learner understand and accept not only 
the legitimacy but also the urgency of the values 
enshrined in the Constitution. Additionally, this 
approach allows the learner to understand the 
role of people’s struggles in the realisation of 
these values.
What are the issues included in the 
Class VII textbook?
The theme for the Class VII grade book is 
the crucial role that equality plays in Indian 
democracy. This theme also serves as one of the 
Units in addition to which the book has four 
more Units. These include Health and State 
Government; Gender; Media; and Markets. 
Units 2, 3 and 5 consist of two consecutive 
chapters, except in the case of the first Unit.
What elements does the Class VII book 
utilise to explain selected issues?
	Storyboards: One component of the feedback 
regarding Class VI book (Social and Political Life-I) 
was that teachers needed more assistance in 
understanding where fictional narratives began 
and ended and in identifying the central concepts 
within these. With this in mind, this year’s book 
introduces storyboards to clearly indicate which 
segments have been fictionalised, and to draw 
The SPL text specifically names 
communities, for example, Dalit, Muslim, 
poor, etc. SPL counts on the teacher 
to transact the material with a firm 
committment to respecting the dignity 
of all students.

the learner into the narrative through the use of 
visuals that are often more expressive than lines 
of text.  Specific concepts raised through the 
storyboards are analysed in the accompanying 
text.
	Unit Pages:  Each Unit begins with a Unit Page 
for teachers to help highlight the main points 
raised in the chapters.
	Note on Evaluation: As with the Class VI 
text, this book does not contain definitions or a 
synthesis of concepts. While we recognise that 
this makes it difficult for teachers to evaluate 
what the child has learnt, our attempt is also to 
try and shift some of the understanding amongst 
teachers on what children are expected to learn 
and how such learning should be evaluated. 
This book contains a short note on evaluation 
procedures that we hope will assist teachers in 
their efforts to move students away from rote 
learning.
	Glossary:  The inclusion of a Glossary with 
each chapter is intended to offer the learner 
greater clarity on the language used in the 
text. The words of the Glossary are NOT limited 
to concepts, and it should not be viewed as 
something to be memorised with the expectation 
that such rote learning will contribute to 
conceptual understanding.
	In-text and End-text Questions: As with the 
Class VI text, this year’s book  includes in-text and 
end-text questions, making use of visual material 
and experiential analysis. In-text questions found 
within the text can be used to assess the extent 
to which content has been assimilated.  End-text 
questions usually cover the main concepts raised 
by the chapter and ask learners to explain these 
in their own words.

Teacher’s note on evaluation
Rethinking the ways in which we evaluate learning is a difficult task but one that 
this new subject area requires. Over the years our evaluation system has for the 
most part rewarded students who learnt by rote. This involuntarily encouraged 
many teachers to mark or underline the answers in the text and in this way a 
vicious cycle in which each reinforced the other, was produced. It is this system 
that needs to be changed to relieve both the teacher and the student. Teachers will 
play a significant role in changing evaluation and this note is an effort in 
this direction.
Ability to reason
These questions aim to gauge the extent to which the learner has understood the concepts 
included in the chapter and is able to articulate its main ideas in their own words as well as 
apply these to different contexts. Examples of this include:
What do you understand by the 
term, “all persons are equal before 
the law”? Why do you think it is 
important in a democracy?
Why should the decisions taken 
by the Chief Minister and other 
ministers be debated in the 
Legislative Assembly?
Can you list two ways in which 
you feel that advertising affects 
issues of equality in a democracy?
How do you think your 
neighbourhood shop gets its 
goods? Find out and explain with 
some examples.
On questions
Teachers need to begin by insisting that evaluation be based on ‘new’ questions. These will be similar 
to the ones used in the text, but not the same. Students will be expected to answer these questions in 
their own words. The confidence to do this needs to be built in the students and language corrections 
should, therefore, be tactful and gentle.
Teachers will also need to design a variety of questions that cover a range of skills. Questions that 
demand recalling information by rote should be minimal. Instead, there needs to be different kinds of 
questions based on the main conceptual ideas of each chapter. Some may be designed to draw upon 
the learner’s ability to reason; to compare and contrast experiences; and to infer and extrapolate 
from situations provided. 
The following are some examples taken from this text to explain the above:

Compare and contrast experiences
These questions require the learner to draw upon the main ideas in the text by comparing and 
contrasting concrete situations. These questions often involve the child’s own experiences. 
Examples of this include:
What is the difference between the 
work that MLAs do in the Assembly 
and the work done by government 
departments?
In what ways do the experiences 
of Samoan children and teenagers 
differ from your own experiences 
of growing up? Is there anything 
described in this experience that you 
wish were part of your growing up?
Compare the earnings per shirt of 
the worker in the garment factory, 
the garment exporter and the 
shop-owner in the US. What do 
you find? 
Infer and extrapolate from situations
This type of question is important to SPL because of the extensive use of narratives to explain 
concepts as well as the constant reference to the learner’s own experiences. It is these questions 
that link the narrative to the underlying concept. The learner’s ability to understand the narrative 
as well as its explication of the concept can be gauged through these questions. 
In India it is often said that we are 
unable to provide health services 
for all because the government 
does not have enough money and 
facilities. After reading the left

that this is true? Discuss.

the stairs affect his dignity as well as his 
safety?
Interpreting visual material
Similarly students should have an opportunity to read and interpret visual material. Hence 
there should be questions based on pictures, tables, flowcharts, etc.

On answers
Since the learner is being asked to write in their own words teachers will need to stop expecting ‘exact’ 
responses. Instead, the learner should be encouraged to state in their own words their understanding 
of the material and concepts they’ve read. Their comprehension, ability to soundly reason and 
communicate their ideas is what needs to be evaluated. 
It would also be fair to expect a range of correct answers when the learner is asked to think through 
a particular narrative situation and apply the underlying concept. It is crucial that teachers discuss 
a common evaluation scheme that helps them distinguish between the range of correct answers as 
well as more crucially identify wrong answers. 
Other forms of evaluation
We need to demystify the stress on examinations as the best tool for evaluating the learner. Rather 
than wait for alternate evaluation structures to trickle down from the higher grades, we need to use 
the learner’s years in middle school to experiment with other ways of evaluation. For this purpose we 
need to use different methods, some of which are briefly discussed below – 
	Open-book exercises: As the name implies ‘open-book’ is a process in which the learner is allowed 
to refer to the textbook while answering a question. Open book exercises offer children an opportunity 
to pick out answers without feeling the burden of “remembering the details”. The learner would be 
asked to read portions of the text again with the question in mind. New questions are essential for this 
exercise. Questions based on the learner’s ability to infer, extrapolate and apply concepts are ideal 
for open-book exercises. Answering the question in the learner’s own words should be emphasised. 
	Oral reasoning and comprehension: Children express so much through speaking and sharing in 
a classroom. Yet, most often, our current educational system tends to regard this as ‘useless talk’. 
Learning from peers and expressing themselves through the spoken word is something that needs to 
be encouraged. Oral evaluation exercises provide an avenue through which to value this. A number 
of in-text questions in this book can be answered orally and the teacher should begin this process in 
the classroom.
	Collective project work: Collective project work is another way to evaluate students. Preparing 
a wall-paper is one such example used in the text. The expectations from these projects should be 
reasonable and limited to what learners can do on their own. Project work should be done in the 
classroom and not as homework. Many end-text questions in this book can be converted into small 
projects. 
These forms of evaluation help emphasise that learning is continuous and happens in multiple 
ways. Evaluation should be designed to enable and encourage this learning and not be reduced to a 
filtering mechanism.

Growing up as
Boys and Girls
Being a boy or a girl is an
important part of one·s identity. The
society we grow up in teaches us
what kind of behaviour is
acceptable for girls and boys, what
boys and girls can or cannot do.
We often grow up thinking that
these things are exactly the same
everywhere. But do all societies
look at boys and girls in the same
way? We will try and answer this
question in this chapter. We will
also look at how the different roles
assigned to boys and girls prepare
them for their future roles as men
and women. We will learn that
most societies value men and
women differently. The roles
women play and the work they do
are usually valued less than the
roles men play and the work they
do. This chapter will also examine
how inequalities between men and
women emerge in the area of work.

In what ways do the experiences
of Samoan children and teenagers
differ from your own experiences
of growing up? Is there anything
in this experience that you wish
was part of your growing up?
A Class VII Samoan child

Why do girls like to go to school
together in groups?
Growing up in Samoa in the 1920s
The Samoan Islands are part of a large group of small
islands in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean. In
the 1920s, according to research reports on Samoan
society, children did not go to school. They learnt
many things, such as how to take care of children or
do household work from older children and from
adults. Fishing was a very important activity on the
islands. Young people, therefore, learnt to undertake
long fishing expeditions. But they learnt these things
at different points in their childhood.
As soon as babies could walk, their mothers or
other adults no longer looked after them. Older
children, often as young as five years old, took over
this responsibility. Both boys and girls looked after
their younger siblings. But, by the time a boy was
about nine years old, he joined the older boys in
learning outdoor jobs like fishing and planting
coconuts. Girls had to continue looking after small
children or do errands for adults till they were
teenagers. But, once they became teenagers they had
much more freedom. After the age of fourteen or so,
girls also went on fishing trips, worked in the
plantations, learnt how to weave baskets. Cooking
was done in special cooking-houses, where boys were
supposed to do most of the work while girls helped
with the preparations.
Growing up male in
Madhya Pradesh in the 1960s
The following is adapted from an account of
experiences of being in a small town in Madhya
Pradesh in the 1960s.
From Class VI onwards, boys and girls went to
separate schools. The girls· school was designed very
differently from the boys· school. They had a central
courtyard where they played in total seclusion and

young boys and girls may be

individually or in groups.
Are there as many girls as boys in
your drawing? Most probably you
would have drawn fewer girls. Can
you think of reasons why there
are fewer women and girls in your
neighbourhood streets, parks and
markets in the late evenings or at
night?
Are girls and boys doing different

reasons why this might be so?

safety from the outside world. The boys· school had
no such courtyard and our playground was just a
big space attached to the school. Every evening, once
school was over, the boys watched as hundreds of
school girls crowded the narrow streets. As these
girls walked on the streets, they looked so purposeful.
This was unlike the boys who used the streets as a
place to stand around idling, to play, to try out tricks
with their bicycles. For the girls, the street was simply
a place to get straight home. The girls always went
in groups, perhaps because they also carried fears
of being teased or attacked.
After reading the two examples above, we realise
that there are many different ways of growing up.
Often we think that there is only one way in which
children grow up. This is because we are most
familiar with our own experiences. If we talk to elders
in our family, we will see that their childhoods were
probably very different from ours.
We also realise that societies make clear
distinctions between boys and girls. This begins from
a very young age. We are for example, given different
toys to play with. Boys are usually given cars to play
with and girls dolls. Both toys can be a lot of fun to
play with. Why are girls then given dolls and boys
cars? Toys become a way of telling children that they
will have different futures when they become men
and women. If we think about it, this difference is
created in the smallest and most everyday things.
How girls must dress, what games boys should play,
how girls need to talk softly or boys need to be tough.
All these are ways of telling children that they have
specific roles to play when they grow up to be men
and women. Later in life this affects the subjects we
can study or the careers we can choose.
In most societies, including our own, the roles men
and women play or the work they do, are not valued
equally. Men and women do not have the same
status. Let us look at how this difference exists in
the work done by men and women.

Valuing housework
Harmeet·s family did not think that the work Jaspreet
did within the house was real work. This feeling is
not unique to their families. Across the world, the
main responsibility for housework and care-giving
tasks, like looking after the family, especially
children, the elderly and sick members, lies with
women. Yet, as we have seen, the work that women
do within the home is not recognised as work. It is
also assumed that this is something that comes
naturally to women. It, therefore, does not have to
be paid for. And society devalues this work.

Melani with her daughter.
Were Harmeet and Shonali correct
in saying that Harmeet·s mother

What do you think would happen
if your mother or those involved
in doing the work at home went
on a strike for a day?
Why do you think that men and
boys generally do not do
housework? Do you think they
should?
Lives of domestic workers
In the story above, Harmeet·s mother was not the
only one who did the housework. A lot of the work
was done by Mangala, their domestic helper.
Many homes, particularly in towns and cities,
employ domestic workers. They do a lot of work ²
sweeping and cleaning, washing clothes and
dishes, cooking, looking after young children or
the elderly. Most domestic workers are women.
Sometimes, even young boys or girls are employed
to do this work. Wages are low, as domestic work
does not have much value. A domestic worker·s
day can begin as early as five in the morning and
end as late as twelve at night! Despite the hard
work they do, their employers often do not show
them much respect. This is what Melani, a
domestic worker had to say about her experience
of working in Delhi ² ´My first job was with a rich
family that lived in a three-storeyed house. The
memsahib was very strange as she would shout
to get any work done. My work was in the kitchen.
There were two other girls who did the cleaning.
Our day would begin at 5 o·clock. For breakfast
we would get a cup of tea and two dry rotis. We
could never get a third roti. In the evening, when
I cooked the food, the two other girls would beg
me to give them an extra roti. I would secretly
give it to them and make an extra one for myself.
We were so hungry after working through the day!
We could not wear chappals in the house. In the
winter, our feet would swell up with the cold. I
used to feel scared of the memsahib but also felt
angry and humiliated. Did we not work all day?
Did we not deserve to be treated with some
respect?µ
In fact, what we commonly term as housework
actually involves many different tasks. A number
of these tasks require heavy physical work. In
both rural and urban areas women and girls have
to fetch water. In rural areas women and girls
carry heavy headloads of firewood. Tasks like

Many women like ShonaliĬs mother in

often referred to as the double burden of
womenĬs work.
washing clothes, cleaning, sweeping and picking up
loads require bending, lifting and carrying. Many
chores, like cooking, involve standing for long hours
in front of hot stoves. The work women do is
strenuous and physically demanding ³ words that
we normally associate with men.
Another aspect of housework and care-giving that
we do not recognise is that it is very time consuming.
In fact, if we add up the housework and the work,
women do outside the home, we find that women
spend much more time working than men and have
much less time for leisure.
Below is some data from a special study done
by the Central Statistical Organization of India
(1998²1999). See if you can fill in the blanks.
Women·s work and equality
As we have seen the low value attached to women·s
household and care-giving work is not an individual
or family matter. It is part of a larger system of
inequality between men and women. It, therefore,
has to be dealt with through actions not just at the
level of the individual or the family but also by the
government. As we now know, equality is an
important principle of our Constitution. The
Constitution says that being male or female should
not become a reason for discrimination. In reality,
inequality between the sexes exists. The government
is, therefore, committed to understanding the reasons
for this and taking positive steps to remedy the
situation. For example, it recognises that burden of
child-care and housework falls on women and girls.
What are the total number of work
hours spent by women in Haryana
and Tamil Nadu each week?
How does this compare with the
total number of work hours spent
by men?

This naturally has an impact on whether
girls can attend school. It determines
whether women can work outside the
house and what kind of jobs and careers
they can have. The government has set up
anganwadis or child-care centres in several
villages in the country. The government
has passed laws that make it mandatory
for organisations that have more than 30
women employees to provide crèche
facilities. The provision of crèches helps
many women to take up employment
outside the home. It also makes it possible
for more girls to attend schools.

Glossary
Identity: Identity is a sense of self-awareness of who one is. Typically, a person can have several
identities. For example, a person can be a girl, a sister and a musician.
Double-burden: Literally means a double load. This term is commonly used to describe the women·s
work situation. It has emerged from a recognition that women typically labour both inside the
home (housework) and outside.
Care-giving: Care-giving refers to a range of tasks related to looking after and nurturing. Besides
physical tasks, they also involve a strong emotional aspect.
De-valued: When someone is not given due recognition for a task or job they have done, they can
feel de-valued. For example, if a boy has put in a lot of effort into making a special birthday gift for
his friend and this friend does not say anything about this, then the boy may feel de-valued.

work in the home is not recognised as work. We
also read how doing household work and taking
care of family members is a full time job and
there are no specific hours at which it begins or

outside the home, and understand how some
occupations are seen to be more suitable for men
than for women. We will also learn about how
women struggle for equality. Getting an education
was, and still is, one way in which new

Breaking stereotypes
Engine drivers are men. But 27-year-old Laxmi Lakra, from a
poor tribal family in Jharkhand has begun to change things.
She is the first woman engine driver for Northern Railways.
Laxmi·s parents are not literate but they struggled and
overcame many hardships to make sure their children got an
education. Laxmi studied in a government school. Even in school,
Laxmi helped with the housework and did odd jobs. She studied
hard and did well and then went on to get a diploma in
electronics. She then took the railway board exam and passed
it on her first attempt.
Laxmi says, ´I love challenges and the moment somebody says it
is not for girls, I make sure I go ahead and do it.µ  Laxmi has had
to do this several times in her life ² when she wanted to take electronics; when she rode
motorcycles at the polytechnic; and when she decided to become an engine driver.
Her philosophy is simple ² ´As long as I am having fun without harming anyone, as long as I am
doing well and helping my parents,  why should I not lead a lifestyle of my choice?µ
(Adapted from Driving Her Train by Neeta Lal, Women·s Features Service)
Fewer opportunities and rigid expectations
A lot of the children in Rosie Ma·am·s class drew
women as nurses and men as army officers. The
reason they did this is because they feel that outside
the home too, women are good at only certain jobs.
For example, many people believe that women make
better nurses because they are more patient and
gentle. This is linked to women·s roles within the
family. Similarly, it is believed that science requires
a technical mind and girls and women are not capable
of dealing with technical things.
Because so many people believe in these
stereotypes, many girls do not get the same support
that boys do to study and train to become doctors
and engineers. In most families, once girls finish
school, they are encouraged by their families to see
marriage as their main aim in life.

the questions ²
If you were Xavier, what subject

In your experience, what are some

experience?
Xavier was happy with the results of his Class X
board exams. Though his marks in Science and
Maths were not high, he had done well in his
favourite subjects ² History and Languages.  When
his parents saw his report card, however, they did
not look pleased at all...
My Goodness! Xavier,  you have
managed only 65% in Maths. Your marks
in Physics are low too...
I know Mama, but it·s
okay, because I don·t
want to take Maths or
Science. I want to

   Why do you want to take History?

But, but, I don·t like
Maths or Science!
Be sensible, son. Take Maths, and you can
study computers side by side. The job market
for computers is very good.
It is important to understand that we live in a
society in which all children face pressures from the
world around them. Sometimes, these come in the
form of demands from adults. At other times, they
can just be because of unfair teasing by our own
friends. Boys are pressurised to think about getting
a job that will pay a good salary. They are also teased
and bullied if they do not behave like other boys.
You may remember that in your Class VI book you
read about how boys at an early age are encouraged
not to cry in front of others.

Ramabai (1858ĩ1922), shown above
with her daughter, championed the cause
of womenĬs education. She never went to
school but learnt to read and write from
her parents. She was given the title
īPanditaĬ because she could read and
write Sanskrit, a remarkable
achievement as women then were not
allowed such knowledge. She went on to
set up a Mission in Khedgaon near Pune
in 1898, where widows and poor women
were encouraged not only to become
literate but to be independent. They were
taught a variety of skills from carpentry
to running a printing press, skills that
are not usually taught to girls even today.
The printing press can be seen in the
picture on the top left corner. RamabaiĬs
Mission is still active today.
Learning for change
Going to school is an extremely important part of
your life. As more and more children enter school
every year, we begin to think that it is normal for all
children to go to school. Today, it is difficult for us
to imagine that school and learning could be seen
as ´out of boundsµ or not appropriate for some
children. But in the past, the skill of reading and
writing was known to only a few. Most children learnt
the work their families or elders did. For girls, the
situation was worse. In communities that taught sons
to read and write, daughters were not allowed to learn
the alphabet. Even in families where skills like
pottery, weaving and craft were taught, the
contribution of daughters and women was only seen
as supportive. For example, in the pottery trade,
women collected the mud and prepared the earth
for the pots. But since they did not operate the wheel,
they were not seen as potters.
In the nineteenth century, many new ideas about
education and learning emerged. Schools became
more common and communities that had never
learnt reading and writing started sending their
children to school. But there was a lot of opposition
to educating girls even then. Yet many women and
men made efforts to open schools for girls. Women
struggled to learn to read and write.

Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain and her dreams about ¶Ladyland·
Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880 ²1932) was born into a rich family who owned a lot of land.  Though
she knew how to read and write Urdu, she was stopped from learning Bangla and English. In those
days, English was seen as a language that would expose girls to new ideas, which people thought were
not correct for them. Therefore, it was mostly boys who were taught English. Rokeya learnt
to read and write Bangla and English with the support of her elder brother and an elder
sister.  She went on to become a writer. She wrote a remarkable story titled
Sultana·s Dream in 1905 to practise her English skills when she was merely 25
years old. This story imagined a woman called Sultana who reaches a place
called Ladyland. Ladyland is a place where women had the freedom to study,
work, and create inventions like controlling rain from the clouds and
flying air cars. In this Ladyland, the men had been sent into seclusion ²
their aggressive guns and other weapons of war defeated by the brain-
power of women. As Sultana travels in Ladyland with Sister Sarah,
she awakes to realise that she was only dreaming.
As you can see, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain was dreaming of
women flying planes and cars even before girls were being
allowed to go to school! This was the way in which education
and learning had changed Rokeya·s own life.  Rokeya did not
stop at getting education just for herself. Her education gave
her the power not only to dream and write, but also to do
more ² to help other girls go to school and to build their
own dreams.  In 1910, she started a school for girls in Kolkata,
and to this day, the school is still functioning.
Learning to read and write led some
women to question the situation of
women in society. They wrote stories,
letters and autobiographies describing
their own experiences of inequality. In
their writings, they also imagined new
ways of thinking and living for both
men and women.
Let us read about the experience of Rashsundari
Devi (1800²1890), who was born in West Bengal,
some 200 years ago. At the age of 60, she wrote her
autobiography in Bangla. Her book titled Amar Jiban
is the first known autobiography written by an Indian
woman. Rashsundari Devi was a housewife from a
rich landlord·s family. At that time, it was believed
that if a woman learnt to read and write, she would
bring bad luck to her husband and become a widow!
Despite this, she taught herself how to read and write
in secret, well after her marriage.
´I would start working at dawn, and I would still
be at it until well beyond midnight. I had no rest in
between. I was only fourteen years old at the time. I
came to nurture a great longing: I would learn to
read and I would read a religious manuscript. I was
55
Unlike Rashsundari Devi and Rokeya
Hossain, who were not allowed to learn
to read and write, large numbers of girls
attend school in India today. Despite this,
there continue to be many girls who leave
school for reasons of poverty, inadequate
schooling facilities and discrimination.
Providing equal schooling facilities to
children from all communities and class
backgrounds, and particularly girls,
continues to be a challenge in India.
unlucky, in those days women were not educated.
Later, I began to resent my own thoughts. What is
wrong with me? Women do not read, how will I do
it? Then I had a dream: I was reading the manuscript
of Chaitanya Bhagabat (the life of a saint)« Later in
the day, as I sat cooking in the kitchen, I heard my
husband say to my eldest son: ´Bepin, I have left my
Chaitanya Bhagabat here. When I ask for it, bring it
in.µ He left the book there and went away. When the
book had been taken inside, I secretly took out a
page and hid it carefully. It was a job hiding it, for
nobody must find it in my hands. My eldest son was
practising his alphabets at that time. I hid one of
them as well. At times, I went over that, trying to
match letters from that page with the letters that I
remembered. I also tried to match the words with
those that I would hear in the course of my days.
With tremendous care and effort, and over a long
period of time, I learnt how to read«µ
After learning the alphabet, Rashsundari Devi was
able to read the Chaitanya Bhagabat. Through her
own writing she also gave the world an opportunity
to read about women·s lives in those days.
Rashsundari Devi wrote about her everyday life
experiences in details. There were days when she
did not have a moment·s rest, no time even to sit
down and eat!
Schooling and education today
Today, both boys and girls attend school in large
numbers. Yet, as we will see, there still remain
differences between the education of boys and girls.
India has a census every 10 years, which counts the
whole population of the country. It also gathers
detailed information about the people living in
India ² their age, schooling, what work they do, and
so on. We use this information to measure many
things, like the number of literate people, and the
ratio of men and women. According to the 1961
census, about 40 per cent of all boys and men

What percentage of children leave
school at the upper primary level?
At which level of education do you
see the highest percentage of
children leaving?
Why do you think that the
percentage of Adivasi girls and
boys leaving school is higher than
that of any other group?
(7 years old and above) were literate (that is, they
could at least write their names) compared to just
15 per cent of all girls and women. In the most recent
census of 2011, these figures have grown to 82 per
cent for boys and men, and 65 per cent for girls and
women. This means that the proportion of both men
and women who are now able to read and have at
least some amount of schooling has increased. But,
as you can also see, the percentage of the male
group is still higher than the female group. The gap
has not gone away.
Here is a table that shows the percentage of girls
and boys who leave schools from different social
groups including Scheduled Caste (SC) and
Scheduled Tribe (ST).
(in percentage)
You have probably noticed in the above table that
SC and ST girls leave school at a rate that is higher
than the category ¶All Girls·. This means that girls
who are from Dalit (SC) and Adivasi (ST) backgrounds
are less likely to remain in school. The 2011 census
also found that Muslim girls are less likely, than SC
and ST girls, to complete primary school. While a
Muslim girl is likely to stay in school for around
three years, girls from other communities spend
around four years in school.
There are several reasons why children from Dalit,
Adivasi and Muslim communities leave school. In
many parts of the country, especially in rural and
poor areas, there may not even be proper schools
nor teachers who teach on a regular basis. If a school

is not close to people·s homes, and there is no
transport like buses or vans, parents may not be
willing to send their girls to school. Many families
are too poor and unable to bear the cost of educating
all their children. Boys may get preference in this
situation. Many children also leave school because
they are discriminated against by their teacher and
classmates.
Women·s movement
Women and girls now have the right to study and go
to school. There are other spheres ² like legal reform,
violence and health ² where the situation of women
and girls has improved. These changes have not
happened automatically. Women individually, and
collectively have struggled to bring about these
changes. This struggle is known as the Women·s
Movement. Individual women and women·s
organisations from different parts of the country are
part of the movement. Many men support the women·s
movement as well. The diversity, passion and efforts
of those involved makes it a very vibrant movement.
Different strategies have been used to spread
awareness, fight discrimination and seek justice.
Here are some glimpses of this struggle.

Campaigning
Campaigns to fight discrimination
and violence against women are an
important part of the women·s
movement. Campaigns have also led
to new laws being passed. A law was
made in 2006 to give women who face
physical and mental violence within
their homes, also called domestic
violence, some legal protection.
Similarly, efforts made by the
women·s movement led the Supreme
Court to formulate guidelines in 1997
to protect women against sexual
harassment at the workplace and
within educational institutions.
In the 1980s, for example, women·s
groups across the country spoke out
against ¶dowry deaths· ³ cases of
young brides being murdered by their
in-laws or husbands, greedy for more
dowry. Women·s groups spoke out
against the failure to bring these
cases to justice. They did so by
coming on to the streets, approaching
the courts, and by sharing
information. Eventually, this became
a public issue in the newspapers and
society, and the dowry laws were
changed to punish families who seek
dowry.
Satyarani, an active member of the womenĬs movement,
sitting on the steps of the Supreme Court surrounded by legal
files gathered during the course of a long legal battle to seek
justice for her daughter who was murdered for dowry.
Raising Awareness
An important part of the women·s
movements· work is to raise public
awareness on women·s rights issues.
Their message has been spread through
street plays, songs and public meetings.
Protesting
The women·s movement raises its voice when violations against women take place or
for example, when a law or policy acts against their interests. Public rallies and

EXERCISES
Glossary
Stereotype: When we believe that people belonging to particular groups based on religion, wealth,
language are bound to have certain fixed characteristics or can only do a certain type of work, we
create a stereotype. For example, in this chapter, we saw how boys and girls are made to take
certain subjects not because he or she has an aptitude for it, but because they are either boys or
girls. Stereotypes prevent us from looking at people as unique individuals.
Discrimination: When we do not treat people equally or with respect we are indulging in
discrimination. It happens when people or organisations act on their prejudices. Discrimination
usually takes place when we treat some one differently or make a distinction.
Violation: When someone forcefully breaks the law or a rule or openly shows disrespect, we can
say that he or she has committed a violation.
Sexual harassment: This refers to physical or verbal behaviour that is of a sexual nature and
against the wishes of a woman.

Media
Teacher·s note
Today, the media and advertising are a
pervasive presence in the lives of young
people, who may or may not have taken
the opportunity to seriously reflect upon
this fact. This Unit offers some ways by
which we can begin to think about these.
The focus is on explaining the strong
links between media and technology and
media and big business.  It explains how
the media ¶sets the agenda· through
influencing our perception of issues
worth devoting time and attention to,
and issues that are neglected or
overridden.
Chapter 6 foregrounds the widespread
effects of the media, and attempts to
connect the issues under discussion to the
learner·s own lives.  At the end of the
chapter, we expect the learner to recognise
the role of big business in the media
coverage of events ³ the way ¶news· is
selected for coverage, and the explicit/
implicit dimensions of that coverage. We
use two fictitious news reports to
demonstrate that there is seldom just one
version of a story or an event.  Building on
this, we expect the learner to develop the
skills required to critically analyse a
newspaper report or a TV story through
scrutinising the information provided, as
well as understanding the logic behind the
exclusion of certain perspectives.
These ideas can be strengthened by
selecting 
examples 
from 
actual
advertisements and structuring similar
questions around them.
This chapter concludes by linking its
contents to the idea of democracy.  It
emphasises, through using examples of
local media as well as social advertising,
how mainstream media and advertising
tend to favour those who have greater
financial as well as social resources. This
point can be reinforced in the classroom
by using local examples of media stories,
as well as posing questions about the ways
in which advertising is changing what is
locally available as well as locally valued.

Understanding Media
What is your favourite TV programme? What do you like listening to on
the radio?  Which newspaper or magazine do you usually read? Do you
surf the internet and what have you found most useful about it? Did you
know that there is one word that is often used to collectively refer to
the radio, TV, newspapers, Internet and several other forms of
communication. This word is ¶media·. In this chapter, you will read
more about the media. You will find out what is required to make it
work, as well as the ways in which the media affects our daily lives. Can
you think of one thing that you have learnt from the media this week?

Look at the collage on the left and

you see.

about what they used to listen to

when the first TV came to your

introduced?
How many people in your

List three things that you know
about some other part of the
world from watching television?
Everything ranging from the stall at the local fair to
the programme that you see on TV can be called
media. Media is the plural form of the word ¶medium·
and it describes the various ways through which we
communicate in society. Because media refers to all
means of communication, everything ranging from
a phone call to the evening news on TV can be called
media. TV, radio and newspapers are a form of media
that reaches millions of people, or the masses, across
the country and the world and, thus, they are called
mass media.
Media and technology
It would probably be difficult for you to imagine your
life without the media. But cable television and the
widespread use of the Internet is a recent
phenomenon. These have been around for less than
twenty years. The technology that mass media uses
keeps changing.
Newspapers, television and radio can reach
millions of people because they use certain
technologies. We also tend to discuss newspapers
and magazines as the print media; and TV and radio
as the electronic media. Why do you think
newspapers are called print media? As you read
further, you will find that this naming is related to
the different technologies that these media use. The
following photographs will give you a sense of the
ways in which technology that mass media uses has
changed over the years and continues to change.
Changing technology, or machines, and making
technology more modern, helps media to reach more
people. It also improves the quality of sound and the
images that you see. But technology does more than
this. It also changes the ways in which we think about
our lives. For example, today it is quite difficult for
us to think of our lives without television. Television
has enabled us to think of ourselves as members of
a larger global world. Television images travel huge

distances through satellites and cables. This allows
us to view news and entertainment channels from
other parts of the world. Most of the cartoons that
you see on television are mostly from Japan or the
United States. We can now be sitting in Chennai or
Jammu and can see images of a storm that has hit
the coast of Florida in the United States. Television
has brought the world closer to us.
Media and money
The different technologies that mass media use are
expensive. Just think about the TV studio in which
the newsreader sits ² it has lights, cameras, sound
recorders, transmission satellites, etc., all of which
cost a lot of money.
In a news studio, it is not only the newsreader
who needs to be paid but also a number of other
people who help put the broadcast together. This
includes those who look after the cameras and lights.
Also, as you read earlier the technologies that mass
media use keep changing and so a lot of money is
spent on getting the latest technology. Due to these
costs, the mass media needs a great deal of money
to do its work. As a result, most television channels
and newspapers are part of big business houses.
Mass media is constantly thinking of ways to make
money. One way in which the mass media earns
money is by advertising different things like cars,
chocolates, clothes, mobile phones, etc. You must
have noticed the number of advertisements that you
have to see while watching your favourite television
show. While watching a cricket match on TV, the
same advertisements are shown repeatedly between
each over and so you are often watching the same
image over and over again. As you will read in the
following chapter, advertisements are repeated in the
hope that you will go out and buy what is advertised.
67
The cost to advertise on a TV channel
varies from  1,000 to  1,00,000 per
10 seconds depending on the popularity
of the channel and time.
Media and democracy
In a democracy, the media plays a very important
role in providing news and discussing events taking
place in the country and the world. It is on the basis
of this information that citizens can, for example,
learn how government works. And often, if they wish
to, they can take action on the basis of these news
stories. Some of the ways in which they can do this
is by writing letters to the concerned minister,
organising a public protest, starting a signature
campaign, asking the government to rethink its
programme, etc.
Given the role that the media plays in providing
information, it is important that the information be
balanced. Let us understand what we mean by a
balanced media report by reading two versions of
the same news event given on the next page.
Chapter 6: Understanding Media
The print media offers a large variety of
information to suit the tastes of different
readers.

Are the above stories in the two
newspapers similar? And if not,
why not? What, in your view, are
the similarities and the
differences?
If you read the story in the News
of India, what would you think
about the issue?
T
he closure of one lakh factories in the
cityŏs residential areas is likely to become
a serious issue. On Monday, thousands of factory
owners and workers took to the streets to strongly
protest this closure. They said that their
livelihoods would be lost. They say that the fault
lies with the municipal corporation because it
continued to issue licenses for new factories to
be set up in residential areas.They also say that
there were no adequate relocation efforts. The
owners and workers plan a one-day city bandh
to protest against this closure. Mr. Sharma, one
of the factory owners said, őThe government says
that it has done a lot to relocate us. But the areas
they have sent us to have no facilities and have
not been developed for the last five years.Œ
Closure of factories causes unrest
Daily News Service
News of India Report
India Daily Report
The fact is that if you had read either newspaper
you would only know one side of the story. If you
had read the News of India, you would most likely
think of the protestors as a nuisance. Their
disrupting traffic and continually polluting the city
with their factories leaves you with a bad impression
about them. But on the other hand, if you had read
the story in the India Daily, you would know that
the protests are because a lot of livelihoods will be
lost if the factories close because the relocation efforts
have not been adequate. Neither of these stories is a
balanced report. A balanced report is one that
discusses all points of view of a particular story and
then leaves it to the readers to make up their minds.
Writing a balanced report, however, depends on
the media being independent. An independent media
means that no one should control and influence its
coverage of news. No one should tell the media what

In many of our homes, TV is on a lot of the time. In many ways, a lot of our impressions
about the world around us are formed by what we see on TV: it is like a ¶window on the
world·. How do you think it influences us? TV has different types of programmes, soap
operas, like Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, game shows, like Kaun Banega Crorepati, reality TV
shows like Big Boss, news, sports and cartoons.
Before, in between and after each programme
are advertisements. Since TV time costs so much
money, only those programmes that can attract
the maximum number of viewers are shown. Can
you think of what such programmes might be?
Think of what are the kinds of things that TV
shows and what it does not. Does it show us
more about the lives of the rich or the poor?
We need to think about what TV does to us,
how it shapes our views of the world, our beliefs,
attitudes and values. We need to realise that it gives us a partial view of the world. While
we enjoy our favourite programmes, we should always be aware of the large exciting
world beyond our TV screens. There is so much happening out there that TV ignores.  A
world beyond film stars, celebrities and rich lifestyles, a world that all of us need to reach
out to and respond to in various ways. We need to be active viewers, who question
whatever we see and hear, while we may enjoy it too!
What does TV do to us and what can we do with TV?
Do you think it is important to
know both sides of the story?
Why?

can be included and what should not be included in
a news story. An independent media is important in
a democracy. As you read above, it is on the basis of
the information that the media provides that we take
action as citizens, so it is important that this
information is reliable and not biased.
However, the reality is that media is far from
independent. This is mainly because of two reasons.
The first is the control that the government has on
the media. When the government prevents either a
news item, or scenes from a movie, or the lyrics of a
song from being shared with the larger public, this
is referred to as censorship. There have been periods
in Indian history when the government censored the
media. The worst of these was the Emergency
between 1975²1977.
Chapter 6: Understanding Media
70
Social and Political Life
 While the government does continue to censor
films, it does not really censor the media·s coverage
of news. Despite the absence of censorship by the
government, most newspapers nowadays still fail to
provide a balanced story. The reasons for this are
complicated. Persons who research the media have
said that this happens because business houses
control the media. At times, it is in the interest of
these businesses to focus on only one side of the
story. Media·s continual need for money and its links
to advertising means that it becomes difficult for
media to be reporting against people who give them
advertisements. Media is, thus, no longer considered
independent because of its close links to business.
Besides the above, the media also tends to focus
on a particular aspect of a story because they believe
this makes the story interesting. Also, if they want
to increase public support for an issue, they often
do this by focusing on one side of a story.
Setting agendas
The media also plays an important role in deciding
what stories to focus on, and therefore, decides on
what is newsworthy. For example, the annual
function at your school is unlikely to make the news.
But if a famous actor is invited as the Chief Guest,
then the media might be interested in covering it. By
focusing on particular issues, the media influences
our thoughts, feelings and actions, and brings those
issues to our attention. Due to the significant
influence it plays in our lives and in shaping our
thoughts, it is commonly said that the media ¶sets
the agenda·.
Very recently, the media drew our attention to
alarming levels of pesticides in cola drinks. They
published reports that indicated the high level of
pesticides and, thus, made us aware of the need to
regularly monitor these colas according to
international quality and safety standards. They did
71
Recognising that the media will not be interested in
covering ¶small· issues that involve ordinary people and
their daily lives, several local groups have come forward
to start their own media. Several people use community
radio to tell farmers about the prices of different crops
and advise them on the use of seeds and fertilisers.
Others make documentary films with fairly cheap and
easily available video cameras on real-life conditions
faced by different poor communities, and, at times, have
even given the poor these video cameras to make films
on their own lives.
Another example is a newspaper called Khabar Lahriya which is a fortnightly that is run by
eight Dalit women in Chitrakoot district in Uttar Pradesh. Written in the local language,
Bundeli, this eight-page newspaper reports on Dalit issues and cases of violence against
women and political corruption. The newspaper reaches farmers, shopkeepers, panchayat
members, school teachers and women who have recently learnt to read and write.
Local media
Fashion shows are very popular with the
media.

this despite the government·s resistance by boldly
declaring that colas were unsafe. In covering this
story, the media positively helped us focus on an
issue that affects our lives and one that we might
not even have been aware of it had it not been for
media reporting.
There are several instances when the media fails
to focus on issues that are significant in our lives.
For example, drinking water is a major problem in
the country. Every year, thousands of people suffer
and die because they do not get safe drinking water.
However, we seldom find the media discussing this
issue. A well-known Indian journalist wrote of how
the Fashion Week, in which clothes designers show
their new creations to rich people, formed the front
page headlines of all the newspapers while several
slums were being demolished in Mumbai, the very
same week, and this was not even noticed!
As citizens of a democracy, the media has a very
important role to play in our lives because it is
through the media that we hear about issues related
Chapter 6: Understanding Media
72
Social and Political Life
to the working of the government. The media decides
what to focus on and in this way it ¶sets the agenda·.
The government can, at times, prevent the media
from publishing a story and this is called censorship.
Nowadays, media·s close relationship with business
often means that a balanced report is difficult to come
by. Given this, it is important for us to be aware that
the ¶factual information· that a news report provides
is often not complete and can be one-sided. We,
therefore, need to analyse the news by asking the
following questions: what is the information I am
learning from this report? What information is not
being provided? From whose point of view is the
article being written? Whose point of view is being
left out and why?

Markets
Teacher·s note
These two chapters focus on aspects of
life and commercial cycles associated with
markets. While some of these processes
may be visible and, therefore, easily
observable, there are also others that are
relatively unfamiliar.
Chapter 7 discusses ¶Markets Around
Us·. At one level, we study different market
sites: a weekly market, neighbourhood
shops, a shopping complex, etc. At another
level, we explore the intricate question,
¶how do goods reach these markets?· We
examine how a chain of markets operates
and the role of wholesale markets within
this, through the case study of a wholesale
vegetable market. We usually associate
¶market· with marketplaces, but buying and
selling takes place in diverse ways and the
chapter discusses how all of this falls
within a larger understanding of markets.
Chapter 8 looks at how markets offer
people different opportunities. This is done
through the ¶story of a shirt·, and the chain
of markets involved in the process. Together
with understanding each step of the
manufacture and circulation of a shirt, we
realise that some people stand to gain in
the market transaction whereas others do
not gain as much, or none at all. The
opportunities are highly unequal. Ways do
exist, such as those of cooperative
marketing, which can provide a better
return to the producers. However, we need
to find many more viable avenues for
equitable distribution.
These chapters offer an opportunity of
bringing in the experience of local markets
for discussion in the classroom. A visit to
a wholesale market would be of interest,
and would allow the learner to find out the
profit margins and details of daily earnings
so that those inequalities can be directly
examined. The experiences of markets are
varied and also quite rich. Hence, one
should allocate time for some questions,
not addressed in the text, which students
may wish to discuss.

Markets Around Us
We go to the market to buy many things ² vegetables, soap, toothpaste, masala,
bread, rice, dal, clothes, notebooks, biscuits, etc. If we make a list of the goods
that we purchase, it would be really long. There are many kinds of markets that
we may visit for our everyday needs: these can include shops, hawker·s stalls in
our neighbourhood, a weekly market, a large shopping complex, perhaps even a
mall. In this chapter, we look at some of these markets and try to understand
how the goods that are sold there reach buyers, who these buyers are, who these
sellers are, and the sorts of problems they face.

Why are things cheap in the

Explain with an example how
people bargain in the market. Can
you think of a situation where the
bargain would be unfair?
Sameer is a small trader in the weekly
market. He buys clothes from a large
trader in the town and sells them in six
different markets in a week. He and
other cloth sellers move in groups. They
hire a mini van for this. His customers
are from villages that are near the
marketplace. At festival times, such as
during Deepavali or Pongal, he does
good business.
Sameer: Seller of clothes
Weekly market
A weekly market is so called because it is held on a
specific day of the week. Weekly markets do not have
permanent shops. Traders set up shops for the day
and then close them up in the evening.  Then they
may set up at a different place the next day. There
are thousands of such markets in India. People come
here for their everyday requirements.
Many things in weekly markets are available at
cheaper rates. This is because when shops are in
permanent buildings, they incur a lot of expenditure
² they have to pay rent, electricity, fees to the
government. They also have to pay wages to their
workers. In weekly markets, these shop owners store
the things they sell at home. Most of them are helped
by their family members and, hence, do not need to
hire workers. Weekly markets also have a large
number of shops selling the same goods which means
there is competition among them. If some trader were
to charge a high price, people would move to another
shop where the same thing may be available more
cheaply or where the buyer can bargain and bring
the price down.
One of the advantages of weekly markets is that
most things you need are available at one place.
Whether you want vegetables, groceries or cloth
items, utensils ² all of them can be found here. You
do not have to go to different areas to buy different
things. People also prefer going to a market where
they have a choice and a variety of goods.
Shops in the neighbourhood
We have seen that the weekly markets offer a variety
of goods. However, we also buy things from other
kinds of markets. There are many shops that sell
goods and services in our neighbourhoods. We may
buy milk from the dairy, groceries from departmental
stores, stationery, eatables or medicines from other

Sujata and Kavita were sent to buy
groceries from their neighbourhood
shop. This was the shop they usually
went to. It was crowded today. The
shop owner managed the shop
herself with two helpers. When they
managed to get into the shop, Sujata
dictated a list to her. She in turn
began asking her helpers to weigh
and pack the items. Meanwhile
Kavita looked around«
On the top left shelf there were
different brands of detergent cakes.
Another shelf had toothpastes,
talcum powder, shampoo, hair oil.
The different brands and different
colours looked so attractive.  On the
floor lay a few sacks.
It took almost 20 minutes to weigh
and pack all the groceries.  Then
Sujata showed her ´notebook.µ  The
woman noted the amount of
` 3000 in the notebook and gave it
back.  She also noted the amount
in her big register.  Then Sujata took the heavy bags out of the shop.  Her family will pay for the
purchases in the first week of next month.
Why did Sujata carry a notebook?
Do you think this system is
useful? Can there be problems?

shops. Many of these are permanent shops, while
others are roadside stalls such as that of the
vegetable hawker, the fruit vendor, the mechanic,
etc.
Shops in the neighbourhood are useful in many
ways.  They are near our home and we can go there
on any day of the week.  Usually, the buyer and seller
know each other and these shops also provide goods
on credit. This means that you can pay for the
purchases later, as we saw in Sujata·s case, for
example.

Why do you think the guard
wanted to stop Kavita and Sujata
from entering the shop? What
would you say if someone stops
you from entering a shop in a
market?
You might have noticed that there are different
kinds of sellers even in the neighbourhood markets.
Some of them have permanent shops and others sell
their goods on the roadside.
Anzal Mall is a five-floor shopping
complex. Kavita and Sujata were
enjoying going up and down in
the lift.  It seemed as if it was
made of glass and they were able
to see outside as they went up.
It was fascinating to see so many
different kinds of shops such as
the ice-cream, burger, pizza and
other food shops; shops full of
home appliances; footwear and
leather items as well as
bookshops.
While wandering about on the
third floor they entered a shop
that was selling branded ready-
made clothes.The security guard
looked at them as if he wanted
to stop them but he did not say
anything. They looked at some
dresses and then looked at the
price tag. None of them was less
than ` 3,000, almost five times the weekly market price!  Sujata whispered to Kavita, ´I·ll take you to
another shop which has good quality ready-made clothes at more reasonable pricesµ.
Shopping complexes and malls
So far we have seen two kinds of marketplaces ²
weekly markets and markets in our neighbourhood.
There are other markets in the urban area that have
many shops, popularly called shopping complexes.
These days, in many urban areas, you also have large
multi-storeyed air-conditioned buildings with shops
on different floors, known as malls. In these urban
markets, you get both branded and non-branded
goods. As you have read in the chapter on advertising,
81
How do you think your
neighbourhood shop gets its
goods? Find out and explain with
some examples.
Why is a wholesale trader
necessary?
branded goods are expensive, often promoted by
advertising and claims of better quality. The
companies producing these products sell them
through shops in large urban markets and, at times,
through special showrooms. As compared to non-
branded goods, fewer people can afford to buy
branded ones.
Chain of markets
In the previous sections, you have read about
different markets from where we buy goods. From
where do you think shop-owners procure their goods?
Goods are produced in factories, on farms and in
homes. However, we don·t buy directly from the
factory or from the farm. Nor would the producers
be interested in selling us small quantities such as
one kilo of vegetables or one plastic mug.
The people in between the producer and the final
consumer are the traders. The wholesale trader first
buys goods in large quantities. For example, the
vegetable wholesale trader will not buy a few kilos of
vegetables, but will buy in large lots of 25 to 100
kilos. These will then be sold to other traders. In
these markets, buying and selling takes place
between traders. It is through these links of traders
that goods reach faraway places. The trader who
finally sells this to the consumer, is the retailer. This
could be a trader in a weekly market, a hawker in
the neighbourhood or a shop in a shopping complex.
We can understand this with the help of the
following examples ²
Every city has areas for wholesale markets. This
is where goods first reach and are then supplied to
other traders. The roadside hawker whom you read
about earlier would have purchased a large quantity
of plastic items from a wholesale trader in the town.
He, in turn, might have bought these from another,
even bigger wholesale trader in the city. The city

Aftab is one of the wholesale traders who purchases in bulk. His
business starts around 2 o·clock in the morning when vegetables
reach the market. This is the time when the vegetable market or
mandi starts buzzing with activity. The vegetables come in trucks,
matadors, tractor trolleys from farms both near and far. Soon the
process of auctions begins. Aftab participates in this auction and
decides what he will buy.  Today, for example, he bought 5 quintals of
cauliflower, 10 quintals of onions. He has a shop in the market where
he stores the vegetables that he has bought. From here he sells to
hawkers and shopkeepers who start coming to the market around
six in the morning. They have to organise their purchases so that
they can start their shop for the day around ten in the morning.
Aftab ²The wholesaler in the city
wholesale trader would have bought a large quantity
of plastic items from the factory and stored them in
a godown. In this way, a chain of markets is set up.
When we purchase, we may not be aware of the chain
of markets through which these goods travel before
they reach us.
Markets everywhere
So far we have seen different marketplaces where
people buy and sell a variety of goods and services.
All these markets are in a specific locality and work
in a particular manner and time. However, it is not
always necessary that one has to go to the market to
purchase goods. You can place orders for a variety
of things through the phone and these days through
the Internet, and the goods are delivered at your
home. In clinics and nursing homes, you may have
noticed sales representatives waiting for doctors.
Such persons are also engaged in the selling of goods.
Thus, buying and selling takes place in different
ways, not necessarily through shops in the market.
The markets that we looked at above are the ones
that we recognise easily. However, there are markets
that we may not be so aware of. This is because a
83

without stepping out of their homes via
the Internet. They use their credit cards to
make īonline purchasesĬ.
large number of goods are bought and sold that we
don·t use directly. For example, a farmer uses
fertilisers to grow crops that he purchases from
special shops in the city and they, in turn get them
from factories.  A car factory purchases engine, gears,
petrol tanks, axles, wheels, etc., from various other
factories. We don·t usually see all the buying and
selling, but only the final product ² the car in the
showroom. The story is similar for any other good.
Markets and equality
In this chapter, we have looked at shop owners in a
weekly market and those in a shopping complex.
They are very different people. One is a small trader
with little money to run the shop whereas the other
is able to spend a lot of money to set up the shop.
They also earn unequal amounts. The weekly market
trader earns little compared to the profit of a regular
shop owner in a shopping complex. Similarly, buyers
are differently placed. There are many who are not
able to afford the cheapest of goods while others are
busy shopping in malls. Thus, whether we can be
buyers or sellers in these different markets depends,
among other things, on the money that we have.
We have also examined  the chain of markets that
is formed before goods can reach us. It is through

with the sale of the shirt. We

CHAPTER
87
Did Swapna get a fair price on the
cotton?
Why did the trader pay Swapna
a low price?
Where do you think large farmers
would sell their cotton? How is
their situation different from
Swapna?
A cotton farmer in Kurnool
Swapna, a small farmer in Kurnool (Andhra Pradesh)
grows cotton on her small piece of land. The bolls of
the cotton plant are ripe and some have already
burst, so Swapna is busy picking cotton. The bolls,
which carry the cotton in them, do not burst open
all at once so it takes several days to harvest the
cotton.
Once the cotton is collected, instead of selling it at
Kurnool cotton market, Swapna and her husband
take the harvest to the local trader. At the beginning
of the cropping season, Swapna had borrowed
` 2,500 from the trader at a very high interest rate
to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides for cultivation.
At that time, the local trader made Swapna agree to
another condition. He made her promise to sell all
her cotton to him.
Cultivation of cotton requires high levels of inputs
such as fertilisers and pesticides and the farmers
have to incur heavy expenses on account of these.
Most often, the small farmers need to borrow money
to meet these expenses.
At the trader·s yard, two of his men weigh the
bags of cotton. At a price of ` 1,500 per quintal, the
cotton fetches ` 6,000. The trader deducts
` 3,000 for repayment of loan and interest and pays
Swapna ` 3,000.
Swapna: ` 3,000 only!
Trader: Cotton is selling cheap. There is a lot of
cotton in the market.
Swapna: I have toiled so hard for four months to
grow this cotton. You can see how fine and clean the
cotton is this time. I had hoped to get a much better
price.

A shop in Erode.
Trader: Amma, I am giving you a good price. Other
traders are not even paying this much. You can check
at the Kurnool market, if you do not believe me.
Swapna: Don·t be angry. How can I doubt you? I had
only hoped that we would earn enough from the
cotton crop to last us a few months.
Though Swapna knows that cotton will sell for at
least ` 1,800 per quintal, she doesn·t argue further.
The trader is a powerful man in the village and the
farmers have to depend on him for loans not only for
cultivation, but also to meet other exigencies such
as illnesses, children·s school fees. Also, there are
times in the year when there is no work and no
income for the farmers, so borrowing money is the
only means of survival.
Swapna·s earning from cotton cultivation is barely
more than what she might have earned as a wage
labourer.
The cloth market of Erode
Erode·s bi-weekly cloth market in Tamil Nadu is one
of the largest cloth markets in the world. A large
variety of cloth is sold in this market. Cloth that is
made by weavers in the villages around is also
brought here for sale. Around the market are offices
of cloth merchants who buy this cloth. Other traders
from many south Indian towns also come and
purchase cloth in this market.
 On market days, you would also find weavers
bringing cloth that has been made on order from the
merchant. These merchants supply cloth on order
to garment manufacturers and exporters around the
country. They purchase the yarn and give
instructions to the weavers about the kind of cloth
that is to be made. In the following example, we can
see how this is done.
89
1.This is a merchantĬs shop in the bazaar.
Over the years, these traders have
developed extensive contacts with
garment firms around the country from
whom they get orders. These traders
purchase the yarn (thread) from others.
2. The weavers live in villages around
and take the yarn supplied by these
traders to their homes where the looms
are located in sheds adjacent to their
houses. This photograph shows a
powerloom in one such home.
The weavers and their families spend
long hours working on these looms.
Most weaving units have about  2ĩ8
powerlooms on which the yarn is woven
into cloth. A variety of sarees, towels,
shirting, ladies dress material and
bedsheets are produced in these looms.
3. They then bring back the finished cloth
to the traders. Here, they can be seen
getting ready to go to the merchant in the
town. The trader keeps an account of the
yarn given and pays them money for
weaving this into cloth.

What are the following people
doing at the Erode cloth market²
merchants, weavers, exporters?
In what ways are weavers
dependent on cloth merchants?
Putting-out system² weavers producing
cloth at home
The merchant distributes work among the weavers
based on the orders he has received for cloth. The
weavers get the yarn from the merchant and supply
him the cloth. For the weavers, this arrangement
seemingly has two advantages. The weavers do not
have to spend their money on purchase of yarn. Also,
the problem of selling the finished cloth is taken care
of. Weavers know from the outset what cloth they
should make and how much of it is to be woven.
However, this dependence on the merchants both
for raw materials and markets means that the
merchants have a lot of power. They give orders for
what is to be made and they pay a very low price for
making the cloth. The weavers have no way of
Chapter 8: A Shirt in the Market
90
Social and Political Life
Weaver·s cooperative
We have seen that the weavers are paid very little by the
merchant under the putting out system. Weaver·s cooperatives
are one way to reduce the dependence on the merchant and to
earn a higher income for the weavers.  In a cooperative, people
with common interests come together and work for their mutual
benefit. In a weaver·s cooperative, the weavers form a group and
take up certain activities collectively. They procure yarn from
the yarn dealer and distribute it among the weavers. The
cooperative also does the marketing. So, the role of the merchant
is reduced, and weavers get a fair price on the cloth.
At times, the government helps the cooperatives by buying cloth from them at a reasonable
price. For instance, the Tamil Nadu government runs a Free School Uniform programme in
the state. The government procures the cloth for this programme from the powerloom weaver·s
cooperatives.  Similarly, the government buys cloth from the handloom weaver·s cooperatives
and sells it through stores known as Co-optex. You might have come across one of these
stores in your town.
If the weavers were to buy yarn on
their own and sell cloth, they
would probably earn three times
more. Do you think this is
possible? How? Discuss.
Do you find similar ¶putting-out·
arrangements in making papads,
masalas, beedis? Find out about
this in your area and discuss in

knowing who they are making the cloth for or at
what price it will be sold. At the cloth market, the
merchants sell the cloth to the garment factories. In
this way, the market works more in favour of the
merchants.
Weavers invest all their savings or borrow money
at high interest rates to buy looms. Each loom costs
` 20,000, so a small weaver with two looms has to
invest ` 40,000. The work on these looms cannot be
done alone. The weaver and another adult member
of his family work upto 12 hours a day to produce
cloth. For all this work, they earn about
` 3,500 per month.
The arrangement between the merchant and the
weavers is an example of putting-out system,
whereby the merchant supplies the raw material and
receives the finished product. It is prevalent in the
weaving industry in most regions of India.
91
What are the demands foreign
buyers make on the garment
exporters? Why do the garment
exporters agree to these
demands?
How do the garment exporters
meet the conditions set by the
foreign buyers?
The garment exporting factory near Delhi
The Erode merchant supplies the cotton cloth
produced by the weavers to a garment exporting
factory near Delhi. The garment exporting factory
will use the cloth to make shirts. The shirts will be
exported to foreign buyers. Among the foreign buyers
are businesspersons from the US and Europe who
run a chain of stores. These large stores do business
strictly on their own terms. They demand the lowest
prices from the supplier. In addition, they set high
standards for quality of production and timely
delivery. Any defects or delay in delivery is dealt with
strictly. So, the exporter tries his best to meet the
conditions set by these powerful buyers.
Faced with such pressures from the buyers, the
garment exporting factories, in turn, try to cut costs.
They get the maximum work out of the workers at
the lowest possible wages. This way they can
maximise their own profits and also supply the
garments to foreign buyers at a cheap price.

Who are the gainers in the market?
A chain of markets links the producer of cotton to
the buyer at the supermarket. Buying and selling
takes place at every step in the chain. Let us recall
who were the people who were involved in this
process of buying and selling. Did they all gain as
much? There were people who made profits in the
market and there were some who did not gain as
much from this buying and selling. Despite their
having toiled very hard, they earned little. Can you
place them in the table shown here?
Market and equality
The foreign businessperson made huge profits in the
market. Compared to this, the garment exporter
made only moderate profits. On the other hand, the
earnings of the workers at the garment export factory
are barely enough to cover their day-to-day needs.
Similarly, we saw the small cotton farmer and the
weaver at Erode put in long hours of hard work. But
they did not get a fair price in the market for what
they produced. The merchants or traders are
somewhere in between. Compared to the weavers,
they have earned more but it is still much less than
the exporter. Thus, not everyone gains equally in
the market. Democracy is also about getting a fair
wage in the market. Whether it is Kanta or Swapna,
if families don·t earn enough how would they think
of themselves as equal to others?
On one hand, the market offers people
opportunities for work and to be able to sell things
that they grow or produce. It could be the farmer
selling cotton or the weaver producing cloth. On the
other hand, it is usually the rich and the powerful

that get the maximum earnings from the market.
These are the people who have money and own the
factories, the large shops, large land holdings, etc.
The poor have to depend on the rich and the powerful
for various things. They have to depend for loans (as
in the case of Swapna, the small farmer), for raw
materials and marketing of their goods (weavers in
the putting out system), and most often for
employment (workers at the garment factory).
Because of this dependence, the poor are exploited
in the market. There are ways to overcome these such
as forming cooperatives of producers and ensuring
that laws are followed strictly.

Equality in Indian Democracy
Teacher·s note
This Unit introduces the learner to the
critical role of equality in democracy, with
specific reference to India. The Constitution
of India guarantees equality to all citizens.
Despite this, the daily lives of people in
India are far from equal. Earlier
discussions on equality in Civics textbooks
most often reiterated certain provisions of
the Constitution without adequately
considering the reality of these in people·s
lives. This Unit adopts a different approach.
It discusses the need for equality through
highlighting the inequalities that continue
to be practised and experienced by various
communities.
The government·s role in passing laws and
instituting policies is discussed to show that
commitment to the alleviation of existing
inequalities is a major part of the work that
governments undertake. The chapter also
briefly introduces an issue of inequality in
the United States of America to highlight
that this is a global phenomenon and a
feature of many democratic countries.
This chapter aims to help the learner
understand that equality and democracy
are dynamic and not static concepts. This
dynamism is reflected in the government·s
passing of new laws and programmes, and
in people·s movements around various
social and economic issues.
Local situations should be used as a
practical reference to make the discussion
on underlying concepts more relevant and
appropriate. A discussion on equality in the
classroom requires empathy as well as a
firm commitment on the teacher·s part to
ensuring that the dignity of all learners be
respected.

CHAPTER
On Equality
Equality in Indian democracy
The Indian Constitution recognises every person as
equal. This means that every individual in the
country, including male and female persons from
all castes, religions, tribes, educational and economic
backgrounds are recognised as equal. This is not to
say that inequality ceases to exist. It doesn·t. But
atleast, in democratic India, the principle of the
equality of all persons is recognised. While earlier
no law existed to protect people from discrimination
and ill-treatment, now there are several that work to
see that people are treated with dignity and as equals.
This recognition of equality includes some of the
following provisions in the Constitution: first that
every person is equal before the law. What this means
is that every person, from the President of the country
to Kanta, a domestic worker, has to obey the same
laws. Second, no person can be discriminated against
on the basis of their religion, race, caste, place of
birth or whether they are female or male. Third, every
person has access to all public places including
playgrounds, hotels, shops and markets. All persons
can use publicly available wells, roads and bathing
ghats. Fourth, untouchability has been abolished.
Can you think of an incident in
your life in which your dignity was
violated? How did this make you
feel?
In the 1975 film, Deewar, a boy who
works as a shoeshine refuses to pick up a
coin thrown at him. He feels that there
is dignity in the work that he does and
insists that his fee be given respectfully.

Social and Political Life
children would often go home for lunch and then not
return to school but now with the midday meal being
provided in school, their attendance has improved.
Their mothers, who earlier had to interrupt their work
to feed their children at home during the day, now
no longer need to do so. This programme has also
helped reduce caste prejudices because  children of
all castes in the school eat this meal together, and in
quite a few places, Dalit women have been employed
to cook the meal. The midday meal programme also
helps reduce the hunger of poor students who often
come to school and cannot concentrate because their
stomachs are empty.
While government programmes play an important
role in increasing equality of opportunity, there is much
that still needs to be done. While the midday meal
programme has helped increase the enrolment and
attendance of poor children in school, there continues
to be big differences in our country between schools
that the rich attend and those that the poor attend.
Even today there are several schools in the country in
which Dalit children are discriminated against and
treated unequally. These children are forced into
unequal situations in which their dignity is not
respected. This is because people refuse to think of
them as equal even though the law requires it.
One of the main reasons for this is that attitudes
change very slowly. Even though persons are aware
that discrimination is against the law, they continue
to treat people unequally on the basis of their caste,
religion, disability, economic status and because they
are women. It is only when people begin to believe
that no one is inferior, and that every person deserves
to be treated with dignity, that present attitudes can
change. Establishing equality in a democratic society
is a continuous struggle and one in which individuals
as well as various communities in India contribute to
and you will read more about this in this book.

where the struggle for equality continues to exist.
The truth is that in many democratic countries
around the world, the issue of equality continues to
be the key issue around which communities struggle.
So, for example, in the United States of America, the
African²Americans whose ancestors were the slaves
who were brought over from Africa, continue to
describe their lives today as largely unequal. This,
despite the fact that there was a movement in the
late 1950s to push for equal rights for African²
Americans. Prior to this, African²Americans were
treated extremely unequally in the United States and
denied equality through law. For example, when
travelling by bus, they either had to sit at the back of
the bus or get up from their seat whenever a white
person wished to sit.
Rosa Parks (1913²2005) was an African²American
woman. Tired from a long day at work she refused to give
up her seat on a bus to a white man on 1 December 1955.
Her refusal that day started a huge agitation against
the unequal ways in which African²Americans were
treated and which came to be known as the Civil
Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964
prohibited discrimination on the basis of race,
religion or national origin. It also stated that all
schools would be open to African²American children
and that they would no longer have to attend
ĮIt is disgraceful to live at the cost of
one's self-respect. Self-respect is the most
vital factor in life. Without it, man is a
cipher. To live worthily with self-
respect, one has to overcome difficulties.
It is out of hard and ceaseless struggle
alone that one derives strength,
confidence and recognition.
ĮMan is mortal. Everyone has to die
some day or the other. But one must
resolve to lay down one's life in
enriching the noble ideals of self-respect
and in bettering one's human life...
Nothing is more disgraceful for a brave
man than to live life devoid of self-
respect.į

separate schools specially set up for them. However,
despite this, a majority of African²Americans
continue to be among the poorest in the country.
Most African-American children can only afford to
attend government schools that have fewer facilities
and poorly qualified teachers as compared to white
students who either go to private schools or live in
areas where the government schools are as highly
rated as private schools.
Challenge of democracy
No country can be described as being completely
democratic. There are always communities and
individuals trying to expand the idea of democracy
and push for a greater recognition of equality on
existing as well as new issues. Central to this is the
struggle for the recognition of all persons as equal
and for their dignity to be maintained. In this book
you will read about how this issue of equality affects
various aspects of our daily lives in democratic India.
As you read these chapters, think about whether
the equality of all persons and their being able to
maintain their dignity is upheld.

Teacher·s note
These two chapters (Chapters 2 and 3) on
State Government are an attempt to
discuss the functions and structure of
government through concrete situations.
We have chosen ¶health· as an example;
there could have been other, equally
important, choices.
Chapter 2 discusses ¶health· as an
important issue for people. There are both
public and private aspects of health
provisioning. Healthcare in India is not
available to all. While the Constitution
supports a view that the right to health is
an aspect of our fundamental rights, its
provisioning is rather unequal. Through
the accounts provided, learners will begin
to visualise the ideal or desired role of
government, and the meanings behind its
structures. Some ways in which this
situation can be changed are also
discussed.
Chapter 3 focuses on how the
government functions, and discusses ideas
of representation, accountability and
public welfare. Though both the executive
and the legislature are presented, one
should not expect students to retain fine
distinctions. It would be best to patiently
encourage them to ask questions such as,
´Who is the most powerful person?µ, ´Why
can·t the MLA solve the problem?µ, etc.
Such queries will enable them to construct
a sense of the government apparatus.
It is important that learners acquire the
confidence to express their views on public
issues and understand the role of
government through the exercises given in
the chapters. You could choose familiar
issues such as water, transport, school-
fees, books, child-labour, etc., for them to
discuss and arrive at how these problems
need to be tackled. Allow them to express
these ideas through wall charts. Given that
discussions on the government and its
functioning often lead to boredom and
cynicism, we need to be able to make
the classroom session less didactic and
more interactive while teaching these
lessons.

What is health?
We can think of health in many ways. Health means
our ability to remain free of illness and injuries. But
health isn·t only about disease. You may have
associated only some of the situations in the above
collage with health. What we often ignore is the fact
that each of the above situations is related to health.
Apart from disease, we need to think of other factors
that affect our health. For example, if people get clean
drinking water or a pollution free environment they
are likely to be healthy. On the other hand, if people
do not get adequate food to eat or have to live in
cramped conditions, they will be prone to illness.
All of us would like to be active and in good spirits
in whatever we may be doing. It isn·t healthy to be
dull, inactive, anxious or scared for long stretches of
time. We all need to be without mental strain. All of
these various aspects of our lives are a part of health.
Pick two situations from the above
collage that are not related to
illness and write two sentences on
how they are related to health.
Would you associate all or some of
these pictures with ¶health· ? In
what ways? Discuss in groups.

Patients usually have to wait in long
queues in government hospitals, like
this one.
India has a large number of doctors, clinics and
hospitals. The country also has considerable
experience and knowledge in running a public
healthcare system. This is a system of hospitals and
health centres run by the government. It has the
ability to look after the health of a large section of
its population scattered over hundreds of thousands
of villages. We will go into more detail on this later.
Moreover, there has been a phenomenal
advancement in medical sciences whereby many new
technologies and treatment procedures are available
in the country.
However, the second column points out how poor
the health situation in our country is. With all the
above positive developments we are not able to provide
proper healthcare facilities to people. This is the
paradox ² something that is contrary to what we
would expect. Our country has the money, knowledge
and people with experience but cannot make the
necessary healthcare available to all. In this chapter,
we will look at some of the reasons for this.

THE COST OF A CURE
Aman and Ranjan are good friends. While Ranjan
comes from a well-to-do family, Aman·s parents have
to struggle to make ends meet...
Hi Aman! Good to
see you back! How have
you been?
I had viral fever and
had to go to the
hospital...
Oh! Me, too! I just got back to
school on Monday. My Daddy
took me to see the doctor
at the new hospital in
Kingsway. It was very exciting!
The building looked so posh. I thought it
was a five star hotel! Daddy said that was
because it was a private hospital, with the
best of facilities.
Daddy had to pay Rs 500 at the reception counter
itself ² before we even met the doctor! There was
nice music playing and everything was really clean
and shiny.
The doctor asked for many tests...but
everyone was so friendly! The lady who took
my blood for testing told me so many jokes
that I forgot to feel the pain!
...and have you
heard the one
about Batman
on Reality TV?
After the test results came, we went back to the
doctor. He looked through them and said everything
was fine, and I only had viral fever. He prescribed some
medicines and rest.
...and so young man ² this pink pill should be
taken three times a day, and the white tablet
once before bed time ² that·s for the

you go to?
Um...it wasn·t as nice as your·s

to take me because he said it
would take too much time...
When our turn came, the doctor examined me, and
asked for a blood test. Then we had to go and stand in
another long queue! People were crowding around in
the testing room too.
We got the test results after three days...and went
back to the hospital. There was a different doctor
that day.
Show me his OPD
card...and the test results
² quickly please!
He seems to be suffering from
a bout of viral fever ² nothing
to worry about.  All he needs
is this one fever-reducing
medicine.
My hospital was nice, but
they gave me many medicines
and the whole thing
cost quite a lot!
Oh! My treatment
did not cost much!

Public and private health care services
From the above story, you must have understood
that we can roughly divide up various health care
facilities in two categories ²
(a) Public health services and
(b) Private health facilities.
Public health services
The public health service is a chain of health centres
and hospitals run by the government. They are linked
together so that they cover both rural and urban
areas and can also provide treatment to all kinds of
problems ² from common illnesses to special services.
At the village level there are health centres where
there is usually a nurse and a village health worker.
They are trained in dealing with common illnesses
and work under the supervision of doctors at the
Primary Health Centre (PHC). Such a centre covers
many villages in a rural area. At the district level is
the District Hospital that also supervises all the health
centres. Large cities have many government hospitals
such as the one where Aman was taken and also
specialised government hospitals.
The health service is called ¶public· for many
reasons. In order to fulfil its commitment of providing
health care to all citizens, the government has
established these hospitals and health centres. Also,
the resources needed to run these services are
obtained from the money that we, the public, pay to
the government as taxes. Hence, such facilities are
meant for everyone. One of the most important
aspects of the public health system is that it is meant
to provide quality health care services either free or
at a low cost, so that even the poor can seek
treatment. Another important function of public
health is to take action to prevent the spread of
diseases such as TB, malaria, jaundice, cholera,
Why pay taxes to the government?
Government uses tax money for
providing many public services for
the benefit of all citizens. Some
services such as defence, police,
judicial system, highways etc.
benefit all citizens. Otherwise, the
citizens cannot organise these
services for themselves.
Taxes fund developmental
programmes and services such as
education, health care,
employment, social welfare,
vocational training etc. required for
needy citizens. Tax money is
utilised for relief and rehabilitation
in case of natural disasters such as
floods, earthquakes, tsunami etc.
Space, nuclear, and missile
programmes are also funded from
the revenues collected as taxes.
Government provides some
services especially for the poor
who cannot afford to purchase
them from the market. One
example is health care. Can you
give other examples?
19
In what ways is the public health
system meant for everyone?
List some Primary Health Centres
(PHCs) or hospitals near your place.
From your experience (or by
visiting any one of them), find out
the facilities provided and people
who run the centre.

diarrhoea, chikungunya, etc. This has to be
organised by the government with the participation
of people otherwise it is not effective. For example,
when taking up a campaign to see that mosquitoes
do not breed in water coolers, rooftops, etc., this
has to be done for all houses in the area.
According to our Constitution, it is the primary
duty of the government to ensure the welfare of the
people and provide health care facilities to all.
The government must safeguard the Right to Life
of every person. If a hospital cannot provide timely
medical treatment to a person, it means that this
protection of life is not being given.
The Court also said that it was the duty of the
government to provide the necessary health services,
including treatment in emergency situations.
Hospitals and medical staff must fulfil their duty of
providing the necessary treatment. Therefore, the
Court asked the State Government to give him the
money that he had spent on his treatment.
Private health facilities
There is a wide range of private health facilities that
exist in our country. A large number of doctors run
their own private clinics. In the rural areas, one
finds Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs). Urban
areas have a large number of doctors, many of them
providing specialised services. There are hospitals
and nursing homes that are privately owned. There
are many laboratories that do tests and offer special
facilities such as X-ray, ultrasound, etc. There are
also shops from where we buy medicines.
As the name suggests, private health facilities
are not owned or controlled by the government.
Unlike the public health services, in private
facilities, patients have to pay a lot of money for
every service that they use.

Today the presence of private facilities can be seen
all around. In fact now there are large companies
that run hospitals and some are engaged in
manufacturing and selling medicines. Medical shops
are found in every corner of the country.
Healthcare and equality:
Is adequate healthcare available to all?
In India, we face a situation where private services
are increasing but public services are not. What is
then available to people are mainly private services.
These are concentrated in urban areas. The cost of
these services is rather high. Medicines are
expensive. Many people cannot afford them or have
to borrow money when there is an illness in the
family.
Some private services encourage incorrect
practices to earn more. At times inexpensive
alternatives, though available, may not be used. For
example, some medical practitioners are found to
prescribe superfluous medicines, injections or saline
when simple medication may suffice.
 In fact, barely 20 per cent of the population can
afford all the medicines that they require during an
illness. Hence, even for those whom one might not

think as being poor, medical expenses cause
hardship. It was reported in a study that 40 per
cent of people who are admitted to a hospital for
some illness or injury have to borrow money or sell
some of their possessions to pay for the expenses.
For those who are poor, every illness in the family
is a cause of great anxiety and distress. What is worse
is that this situation tends to happen again and
again. Those who are poor are in the first place
undernourished. These families are not eating as
much as they should. They are not provided basic
necessities like drinking water, adequate housing,
clean surroundings, etc., and therefore, are more
likely to fall ill. The expenses on illness make their
situation even worse.
Sometimes it is not only the lack of money that
prevents people from getting proper medical
treatment. Women, for example, are not taken to a
doctor in a prompt manner. Women·s health
concerns are considered to be less important than
the health of men in the family. Many tribal areas
have few health centres and they do not run properly.
Even private health services are not available.
What can be done?
There is little doubt that the health situation of most
people in our country is not good. It is the
responsibility of the government to provide quality
healthcare services to all its citizens, especially the
poor and the disadvantaged. However, health is as
much dependent on basic amenities and social
conditions of the people, as it is on healthcare
services. Hence, it is important to work on both in
order to improve the health situation of our people.
And this can be done. Look at the following example.

The Kerala experience
In 1996, the Kerala government made some major
changes in the state. Forty per cent of the entire state
budget was given to panchayats. They could plan
and provide for their requirements. This made it
possible for a village to make sure that proper
planning was done for water, food, women·s
development and education. This meant that water
supply schemes were checked, the working of schools
and anganwadis was ensured and specific problems
of the village were taken up. Health centres were
also improved. All of this helped to improve the
situation. Despite these efforts, however, some
problems ² such as shortage of medicines,
insufficient hospital beds, not enough doctors ²
remained, and these needed to be addressed.

Let us look at an example of another country and
its approach to issues of health.
The Costa Rican approach
Costa Rica is considered to be one of the healthiest
countries in Central America. The main reason for
this can be found in the Costa Rican Constitution.
Several years ago, Costa Rica took a very important
decision and decided not to have an army. This
helped the Costa Rican government to spend the
money that the army would have used, on health,
education and other basic needs of the people. The
Costa Rican government believes that a country has
to be healthy for its development and pays a lot of
attention to the health of its people. The Costa Rican
government provides basic services and amenities
to all Costa Ricans. For example, it provides safe
drinking water, sanitation, nutrition and housing.
Health education is also considered very important
and knowledge about health is an essential part of
education at all levels.

government. In this way we say that the MLAs
represent people. The example below will help us
understand this better.
Every state in India has a Legislative Assembly.
Each state is divided into different areas or
constituencies. For example, look at the map below.
It shows that the state of Himachal Pradesh is divided
into 68 assembly constituencies. From each
constituency, the people elect one representative who
then becomes a Member of the Legislative Assembly
(MLA). You would have noticed that people stand for
elections in the name of different parties. These MLAs,
therefore, belong to different political parties.
How do people who are MLAs become ministers or
chief minister? A political party whose MLAs have
won more than half the number of constituencies in
a state can be said to be in a majority. The political
party that has the majority is called the ruling party
and all other members are called the opposition. For
example, the Legislative Assembly of the state of
Himachal Pradesh has 68 MLA constituencies.

At times, the ruling party may not
be a single party but a group of
parties working together. This is
called a coalition. Discuss with
your teacher.
Candidates from various political parties won the
2017 assembly elections and became MLAs. Since
the total number of MLAs in the Legislative Assembly
is 68, a political party would have needed to have
more than 34 MLAs in order to gain a majority. The
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with 44 MLAs had the
majority and it became the ruling party. All other MLAs
became the opposition. In this case, the Indian National
Congress (INC) was the major opposition party, since it
had the largest number of MLAs after the BJP. Among
the opposition were other parties, including those who
had been elected as independent candidates.
After the elections, the MLAs belonging to the
ruling party will elect their leader who will become
the chief minister. In this case, the BJP MLAs chose
Shri Jairam Thakur as their leader and he became
the chief minister. The chief minister then selects
other people as ministers. After the elections, it is
the Governor of the state who appoints the chief
minister and other ministers.
The chief minister and other ministers have the
responsibility of running various government
departments or ministries. They have separate offices.
A Legislative Assembly is a place where all the MLAs,
whether from the ruling party or from the opposition
meet to discuss various things. Hence, some MLAs
have dual responsibilities: one as an MLA and the
other as a minister. We will read about this further.

security checks, they were taken upstairs. There was
a gallery from where they could see the large hall
below. There were rows and rows of desks.
 This Assembly was going to have a debate on a
current problem. During this time, MLAs can express
their opinions and ask questions related to the issue
or give suggestions about what should be done by
the government. Those who wish to, can respond to
this. The minister then replies to the questions and
tries to assure the Assembly that adequate steps are
being taken.
 The chief minister and other ministers have to
take decisions and run the government. We usually
hear about them or see them in the news channels
or in the papers. However, whatever decisions are
being taken have to be approved by the members of
the legislative assembly. In a democracy, these
members can ask questions, debate an important
issue, decide where money should be spent, etc. They
have the main authority.
MLA 1: In my constituency of Akhandagaon,
during the last three weeks, there were 15 deaths
because of diarrhoea. I think it is a shame that this
government has not been able to check the situation
of a simple problem like diarrhoea while proclaiming
itself to be a champion of technology. I would call
the attention of the minister in charge of health to
take immediate measures to control the situation.
MLA 2: My question is why are government
hospitals in such a bad situation? Why is the
government not appointing proper doctors and other
medical staff in the district? I would also like to know
how the government plans to deal with this situation

which is affecting a large number of people and is
also spreading. This is an epidemic.
MLA 3: My constituency of Tolpatti too has a
serious shortage of water. Women travel up to 3 or 4
kilometres to collect water. How many tankers have
been put into service to supply water? How many
wells and ponds have been cleaned and disinfected?
MLA 4: I think my colleagues are exaggerating the
problem. The government has taken steps to control
the situation. Water tankers have been put into
service. ORS packets are being distributed. The
government is doing everything possible to help
people.
MLA 5: We have very poor facilities in our hospitals.
There are hospitals that do not have a doctor and no
medical staff has been appointed for the last few
years. In another hospital, the doctor has gone on a
long leave. This is a shame. I think the situation is
going from bad to worse. How are we going to
ensure that ORS packets reach all families in the
affected areas?
MLA 6: The opposition members are unnecessarily
blaming the government. The previous government
did not pay any attention to sanitation. We have now
taken up a drive to clear the garbage that has been
lying around for years.

What were the main arguments
put forward by different MLAs
who thought that the government
was not taking the situation in a
serious manner?
If you were the health minister,
how would you respond to the
above discussion?
Do you think the above debate
would have been useful in some
ways? How? Discuss.
In the working of the government,
explain the difference between
being an MLA and an MLA who is
also a minister.
In the earlier section you have read about a debate
in the Legislative Assembly. The members were
debating the action taken or not taken by the
government. This is because the MLAs are together
responsible for the work of the government. In
common usage the word ¶government· refers to
government departments and various ministers who
head them. The overall head is the chief minister.
More correctly, this is called the executive part of
the government. All the MLAs who gather together
(assemble) in the legislative assembly are called the
Legislature. They are the ones who authorise and
supervise their work. As we saw in the earlier section,
it is from among them that the head of the executive,
or the chief minister is formed.
Working of the government
The Legislative Assembly is not the only place where
opinions are expressed about the work of the
government and action is demanded. You will find
newspapers, TV channels and other organisations
regularly talking about the government. In a
democracy, there are various ways through which
people express their views and also take action. Let
us look at one such way.
Soon after the discussion in the assembly, there
was a press conference organised by the health
minister. Large numbers of people from different
newspapers were present. The minister and some
government officials were also present. The minister
explained the steps the government had taken.
Reporters asked many questions at this meeting.
These discussions were then reported in different
newspapers. The following page has one such report.
During the next week, the chief minister and the
minister for health visited Patalpuram district. They
went to visit the families who had lost their relatives
and also visited people in the hospitals. The
government announced a compensation for these

families. The chief minister also said that he thought
the problem was not only one of sanitation but also
of a lack of clean drinking water. He said that a high-
level enquiry committee will be asked to look into
the needs of the district to provide sanitation facilities
and would request the minister for Public Works to
take care of the needs of proper water supply in the
region.
As you saw above, the people in power like the
chief minister and the minister have to take action.
They do so through various departments like the
Public Works Department, the Agriculture
Department, the Health Department, the Education
Department and so on. They also have to answer
questions that are asked in the Legislative Assembly
and convince people asking the questions that proper
steps are being taken. At the same time, newspapers
and the media widely discuss the issue and the
government has to respond, for example, by holding
the press conferences.
During the last few weeks,
there have been many
deaths in some districts of
our state. There has been a
strong reaction that the
government has not taken
this seriously. The health
minister explained today at
a press conference that his
government has asked all
the collectors and the chief
medical officers to take
urgent measures. The most
important problem is that
of drinking water. The
minister said that they
intend to supply drinking
water to every village
through tanker trucks.
The chief minister has
promised funds for this
work. They also plan to
start a campaign to inform
people about the steps that
can be taken to prevent
diarrhoea. When a reporter
asked him as to what steps
are being taken to see that
garbage that has been lying
around for months is
quickly collected, the chief
minister said that he would
look into this.

Chapter 3: How the State Government Works
In a democracy, people organise meetings
to voice their opinions and protest
against the government.
 The government can also decide to make new laws
for the state regarding sanitation and health facilities.
For example, it may make it compulsory for
municipal corporations to ensure that there are
adequate toilets in every urban area. It may also
ensure that a health worker is appointed in every
village. This act of making laws on certain issues is
done in the Legislative Assembly of each state. The
various government departments then implement
these laws. Laws for the entire country are made in
the Parliament. You will read more about the
Parliament next year.
In a democracy, it is the people who elect their
representatives as Members of the Legislative
Assembly (MLAs) and, thus, it is the people who have
the main authority. The ruling party members then
form the government and some members are
appointed ministers. These ministers are in charge
of various departments of the government such as
health in the above example. Whatever work is done
by these departments has to be approved by the
members of the legislative assembly.

After introducing the topic and having a brief discussion
with the whole class, the teacher divides the class into groups.
The group discusses the issue and decides what it would like
to include in the wall-paper. Children then work
individually or in pairs to read the collected material and
write their observations or experiences. They can do this
through creating stories, poems, case studies, interviews, etc.
The group looks at the material that they have
selected, drawn or written. They read each otherĬs
writing and provide feedback to each other. They
make decisions on what should be included and
finalise the layout for the wallpaper.

A wallpaper is an interesting activity through which
research can be done on particular topics of interest.
The following photographs explain the different
aspects involved in creating a wallpaper in a

Each group then presents the wallpaper to the entire class. It is important that
more than one member of the group is asked to present and that each group is
allotted the same amount of time to discuss their work. After each group has
presented, it would be a good idea to have a feedback session on the following ĩ
What more could they do on their own? How could their work be organised
better? How could writing and presentation be improved upon?
Do a similar wallpaper project
about any issue connected with
the working of your State

Gender
Teacher·s note
Gender is a term that you may often have
heard. It is a term, however, that is not
easily understood. It tends to remain
distant from our lives and restricted to
discussions during training programmes.
In fact, it is something that all of us
experience in our lives on a daily basis. It
determines, for example, who we are and
what we will become, where we can go and
where not, the life choices available to us
and those we eventually make. Our
understanding of gender is often based on
the family and society that we live in. This
leads us to think that the roles we see men
and women around us play are fixed and
natural. In fact, these roles differ across
communities around the world. By gender,
then, we mean the many social values and
stereotypes our cultures attach to the
biological distinction ¶male· and ¶female·. It
is a term that helps us to understand many
of the inequalities and power relations
between men and women in society.
The following two chapters explore the
concept of gender without actually using
the term. Instead, through different
pedagogic tools like case studies, stories,
classroom activities, data analysis and
photographs, students are encouraged to
question and think about their own lives
and the society around them. Gender is
often mistakenly thought to be something
that concerns women or girls alone. Thus,
care has been taken in these chapters to
draw boys into the discussion as well.
Chapter 4 uses two case studies, situated
in different places and points in time to
show how girls and boys are brought up
or socialised differently. This enables them
to understand that the process of
socialisation is not uniform; instead it is
socially determined and changes
continuously over time. The chapter also
addresses the fact that societies assign
different values to the roles men and
women play and the work they do, which
becomes a basis for inequality and
discrimination. Through a storyboard,
students discuss the issue of housework.
Done primarily by women, housework is
often not considered ¶work· and, therefore
made invisible and devalued.
 Chapter 5 further develops ideas around
gender inequalities in the world of work and
describes women·s struggles for equality.
Through a classroom activity, students
begin questioning existing stereotypes
regarding work and career choices. The
chapter also points out that opportunities
like education are not equally available to
boys and girls. By reading about the lives
of two Indian women, from the ninteenth
and twentieth centuries, students see how
women struggled to change their lives by
learning to read and write. Change on a
large scale usually takes place through
collective struggles. The chapter concludes
with a photo-essay that gives examples of
different strategies the women·s movement
has used to fight for change.

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s 
life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks 
a departure from the legacy of bookish learning, which continues to shape our 
system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi 
and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this 
basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of 
sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will 
take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education 
outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and 
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and 
to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given 
space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the 
information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as 
the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and 
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we 
perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed 
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. 
Flexibility in the daily timetable is as necessary as rigour in implementing the 
annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days is actually devoted 
to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine 
how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy 
experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have 
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting 
knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and 
the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by 
giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, 
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates 
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this 
book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Social Sciences, 
Professor Hari Vasudevan, the Chief Advisor, Sarada Balagopalan and the Advisor, 
Arvind Sardana for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed 
to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making 
this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have 
generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content 
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises 
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential 
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has 
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. 
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes 
have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of 
the following:
•	 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in 
the same class
•	 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same 
subject
•	 Difficulty level
•	 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much 
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through 
self-learning or peer-learning
•	 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes 
given above.

Introductory note for teachers
There is a substantial difference between 
Civics and Social and Political Life, not only 
in terms of the topics covered but also in the 
pedagogic approaches required in each subject 
area. Keeping these in mind, this Introduction 
attempts to clarify certain aspects of Social and 
Political Life.  
What is Social and Political Life?
Social and Political Life (SPL) is a new subject 
area in middle school social science that has 
replaced the earlier subject of Civics. The National 
Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 strongly 
argues that Civics should be discontinued 
and its focus on government institutions and 
functioning should be tempered in the new 
subject that replaces it. SPL, as its name 
suggests, focuses on topics related to social, 
political and economic life in contemporary 
India. 
What pedagogical 
approach does SPL use? 
SPL’s use of ‘real-life’ situations is a marked 
departure from Civics. SPL uses these real 
situations to teach concepts because it recognises 
that children learn best through concrete 
experiences. It uses material that draws upon 
the experiential understanding of familial and 
social issues that middle school children bring to 
the classroom. SPL further develops the learner’s 
abilities to critically understand and analyse 
these issues in keeping with the tenets of the 
Indian Constitution. 
This pedagogical approach tends to avoid the 
use of definitions to sum up a concept. Instead, 
it uses case studies and narratives to explain 
concepts. The concepts embedded within the 
narratives are made clear through the in-text 
and end-text questions. The aim is to have the 
learner understand the concept through their 
own experiences and write about it in their own 
words. 
This often means that there is seldom one 
‘correct’ answer to the questions posed. However 
there is a wrong answer. Teachers should try 
to gauge whether an answer to a question 
adequately reflects the learner’s understanding 
of the concept being discussed. 
Given that children learn best through 
understanding and applying concepts 
to local realities, can a ‘national’ 
textbook adequately reflect the many 
‘locals’ that make up the nation? 
SPL functions by the pedagogic principle that 
children learn best through an experiential 
understanding of concepts. This poses a 
contradiction when the effort is to write a ‘national’ 
textbook, because a national text can neither 
sufficiently represent all the various aspects 
of the various locals, nor fix the sociocultural 
background of the child for whom the book 
is intended. Therefore, the case studies and 
narratives used in SPL are a mix of rural and 
urban examples in which the assumed learner 
is not easily discernible.

In addition to the important job of 
transacting the text, what crucial role 
does SPL expect teachers to play in 
the classroom?
SPL counts on the teacher to play a very 
significant role in the classroom for the following 
reasons. First, the SPL text specifically names 
communities (for example: Dalit, Muslim, 
poor etc.) in its discussion of various issues 
and this may lead to some discomfort in a 
classroom that has a student population from 
different sociocultural and (perhaps) economic 
backgrounds. We expect the teacher to play a 
crucial role in transacting this material with a 
sensitivity and firm commitment to respecting the 
dignity of all students in the classroom and the 
school. Second, given the limited ability of this 
‘national’ text to engage the local we also envision 
the teacher playing a major role in adding local 
examples to the discussion of concepts, provided 
these remain true to the logic and understanding 
of each concept as intended by the book’s authors.
How does the SPL help the learner 
assimilate the values enshrined in the 
Constitution?
At first glance it might appear to some that unlike 
Civics, SPL’s focus on ‘real’ examples contradicts 
the tenets of the Constitution. Such a focus, 
however, is a technique utilised in SPL in response 
to a critique of Civics textbooks that always only 
discussed the ideal and seldom deliberated upon 
the reality that was very different. Since the 
learner is already aware of such realities, to avoid 
discussing them would make the learning of social 
and political concepts didactic and disconnected. 
Instead, SPL uses this embedded awareness to 
make the learner understand and accept not only 
the legitimacy but also the urgency of the values 
enshrined in the Constitution. Additionally, this 
approach allows the learner to understand the 
role of people’s struggles in the realisation of 
these values.
What are the issues included in the 
Class VII textbook?
The theme for the Class VII grade book is 
the crucial role that equality plays in Indian 
democracy. This theme also serves as one of the 
Units in addition to which the book has four 
more Units. These include Health and State 
Government; Gender; Media; and Markets. 
Units 2, 3 and 5 consist of two consecutive 
chapters, except in the case of the first Unit.
What elements does the Class VII book 
utilise to explain selected issues?
	Storyboards: One component of the feedback 
regarding Class VI book (Social and Political Life-I) 
was that teachers needed more assistance in 
understanding where fictional narratives began 
and ended and in identifying the central concepts 
within these. With this in mind, this year’s book 
introduces storyboards to clearly indicate which 
segments have been fictionalised, and to draw

the learner into the narrative through the use of 
visuals that are often more expressive than lines 
of text.  Specific concepts raised through the 
storyboards are analysed in the accompanying 
text.
	Unit Pages:  Each Unit begins with a Unit Page 
for teachers to help highlight the main points 
raised in the chapters.
	Note on Evaluation: As with the Class VI 
text, this book does not contain definitions or a 
synthesis of concepts. While we recognise that 
this makes it difficult for teachers to evaluate 
what the child has learnt, our attempt is also to 
try and shift some of the understanding amongst 
teachers on what children are expected to learn 
and how such learning should be evaluated. 
This book contains a short note on evaluation 
procedures that we hope will assist teachers in 
their efforts to move students away from rote 
learning.
	Glossary:  The inclusion of a Glossary with 
each chapter is intended to offer the learner 
greater clarity on the language used in the 
text. The words of the Glossary are NOT limited 
to concepts, and it should not be viewed as 
something to be memorised with the expectation 
that such rote learning will contribute to 
conceptual understanding.
	In-text and End-text Questions: As with the 
Class VI text, this year’s book  includes in-text and 
end-text questions, making use of visual material 
and experiential analysis. In-text questions found 
within the text can be used to assess the extent 
to which content has been assimilated.  End-text 
questions usually cover the main concepts raised 
by the chapter and ask learners to explain these 
in their own words.

Teacher’s note on evaluation
Rethinking the ways in which we evaluate learning is a difficult task but one that 
this new subject area requires. Over the years our evaluation system has for the 
most part rewarded students who learnt by rote. This involuntarily encouraged 
many teachers to mark or underline the answers in the text and in this way a 
vicious cycle in which each reinforced the other, was produced. It is this system 
that needs to be changed to relieve both the teacher and the student. Teachers will 
play a significant role in changing evaluation and this note is an effort in 
this direction.
Ability to reason
These questions aim to gauge the extent to which the learner has understood the concepts 
included in the chapter and is able to articulate its main ideas in their own words as well as 
apply these to different contexts. Examples of this include:
What do you understand by the 
term, “all persons are equal before 
the law”? Why do you think it is 
important in a democracy?
Why should the decisions taken 
by the Chief Minister and other 
ministers be debated in the 
Legislative Assembly?
Can you list two ways in which 
you feel that advertising affects 
issues of equality in a democracy?
How do you think your 
neighbourhood shop gets its 
goods? Find out and explain with 
some examples.
On questions
Teachers need to begin by insisting that evaluation be based on ‘new’ questions. These will be similar 
to the ones used in the text, but not the same. Students will be expected to answer these questions in 
their own words. The confidence to do this needs to be built in the students and language corrections 
should, therefore, be tactful and gentle.
Teachers will also need to design a variety of questions that cover a range of skills. Questions that 
demand recalling information by rote should be minimal. Instead, there needs to be different kinds of 
questions based on the main conceptual ideas of each chapter. Some may be designed to draw upon 
the learner’s ability to reason; to compare and contrast experiences; and to infer and extrapolate 
from situations provided. 
The following are some examples taken from this text to explain the above:

Compare and contrast experiences
These questions require the learner to draw upon the main ideas in the text by comparing and 
contrasting concrete situations. These questions often involve the child’s own experiences. 
Examples of this include:
What is the difference between the 
work that MLAs do in the Assembly 
and the work done by government 
departments?
In what ways do the experiences 
of Samoan children and teenagers 
differ from your own experiences 
of growing up? Is there anything 
described in this experience that you 
wish were part of your growing up?
Compare the earnings per shirt of 
the worker in the garment factory, 
the garment exporter and the 
shop-owner in the US. What do 
you find? 
Infer and extrapolate from situations
This type of question is important to SPL because of the extensive use of narratives to explain 
concepts as well as the constant reference to the learner’s own experiences. It is these questions 
that link the narrative to the underlying concept. The learner’s ability to understand the narrative 
as well as its explication of the concept can be gauged through these questions.

unable to provide health services

does not have enough money and

Interpreting visual material
Similarly students should have an opportunity to read and interpret visual material. Hence 
there should be questions based on pictures, tables, flowcharts, etc.

On answers
Since the learner is being asked to write in their own words teachers will need to stop expecting ‘exact’ 
responses. Instead, the learner should be encouraged to state in their own words their understanding 
of the material and concepts they’ve read. Their comprehension, ability to soundly reason and 
communicate their ideas is what needs to be evaluated. 
It would also be fair to expect a range of correct answers when the learner is asked to think through 
a particular narrative situation and apply the underlying concept. It is crucial that teachers discuss 
a common evaluation scheme that helps them distinguish between the range of correct answers as 
well as more crucially identify wrong answers. 
Other forms of evaluation
We need to demystify the stress on examinations as the best tool for evaluating the learner. Rather 
than wait for alternate evaluation structures to trickle down from the higher grades, we need to use 
the learner’s years in middle school to experiment with other ways of evaluation. For this purpose we 
need to use different methods, some of which are briefly discussed below – 
	Open-book exercises: As the name implies ‘open-book’ is a process in which the learner is allowed 
to refer to the textbook while answering a question. Open book exercises offer children an opportunity 
to pick out answers without feeling the burden of “remembering the details”. The learner would be 
asked to read portions of the text again with the question in mind. New questions are essential for this 
exercise. Questions based on the learner’s ability to infer, extrapolate and apply concepts are ideal 
for open-book exercises. Answering the question in the learner’s own words should be emphasised. 
	Oral reasoning and comprehension: Children express so much through speaking and sharing in 
a classroom. Yet, most often, our current educational system tends to regard this as ‘useless talk’. 
Learning from peers and expressing themselves through the spoken word is something that needs to 
be encouraged. Oral evaluation exercises provide an avenue through which to value this. A number 
of in-text questions in this book can be answered orally and the teacher should begin this process in 
the classroom.
	Collective project work: Collective project work is another way to evaluate students. Preparing 
a wall-paper is one such example used in the text. The expectations from these projects should be 
reasonable and limited to what learners can do on their own. Project work should be done in the 
classroom and not as homework. Many end-text questions in this book can be converted into small 
projects. 
These forms of evaluation help emphasise that learning is continuous and happens in multiple 
ways. Evaluation should be designed to enable and encourage this learning and not be reduced to a 
filtering mechanism.

Growing up as
Boys and Girls
Being a boy or a girl is an
important part of one·s identity. The
society we grow up in teaches us
what kind of behaviour is
acceptable for girls and boys, what
boys and girls can or cannot do.
We often grow up thinking that
these things are exactly the same
everywhere. But do all societies
look at boys and girls in the same
way? We will try and answer this
question in this chapter. We will
also look at how the different roles
assigned to boys and girls prepare
them for their future roles as men
and women. We will learn that
most societies value men and
women differently. The roles
women play and the work they do
are usually valued less than the
roles men play and the work they
do. This chapter will also examine
how inequalities between men and
women emerge in the area of work.

In what ways do the experiences
of Samoan children and teenagers
differ from your own experiences
of growing up? Is there anything
in this experience that you wish
was part of your growing up?
A Class VII Samoan child
in his school uniform.
Why do girls like to go to school
together in groups?
Growing up in Samoa in the 1920s
The Samoan Islands are part of a large group of small
islands in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean. In
the 1920s, according to research reports on Samoan
society, children did not go to school. They learnt
many things, such as how to take care of children or
do household work from older children and from
adults. Fishing was a very important activity on the
islands. Young people, therefore, learnt to undertake
long fishing expeditions. But they learnt these things
at different points in their childhood.
As soon as babies could walk, their mothers or
other adults no longer looked after them. Older
children, often as young as five years old, took over
this responsibility. Both boys and girls looked after
their younger siblings. But, by the time a boy was
about nine years old, he joined the older boys in
learning outdoor jobs like fishing and planting
coconuts. Girls had to continue looking after small
children or do errands for adults till they were
teenagers. But, once they became teenagers they had
much more freedom. After the age of fourteen or so,
girls also went on fishing trips, worked in the
plantations, learnt how to weave baskets. Cooking
was done in special cooking-houses, where boys were
supposed to do most of the work while girls helped
with the preparations.
Growing up male in
Madhya Pradesh in the 1960s
The following is adapted from an account of
experiences of being in a small town in Madhya
Pradesh in the 1960s.
From Class VI onwards, boys and girls went to
separate schools. The girls· school was designed very
differently from the boys· school. They had a central
courtyard where they played in total seclusion and

safety from the outside world. The boys· school had
no such courtyard and our playground was just a
big space attached to the school. Every evening, once
school was over, the boys watched as hundreds of
school girls crowded the narrow streets. As these
girls walked on the streets, they looked so purposeful.
This was unlike the boys who used the streets as a
place to stand around idling, to play, to try out tricks
with their bicycles. For the girls, the street was simply
a place to get straight home. The girls always went
in groups, perhaps because they also carried fears
of being teased or attacked.
After reading the two examples above, we realise
that there are many different ways of growing up.
Often we think that there is only one way in which
children grow up. This is because we are most
familiar with our own experiences. If we talk to elders
in our family, we will see that their childhoods were
probably very different from ours.
We also realise that societies make clear
distinctions between boys and girls. This begins from
a very young age. We are for example, given different
toys to play with. Boys are usually given cars to play
with and girls dolls. Both toys can be a lot of fun to
play with. Why are girls then given dolls and boys
cars? Toys become a way of telling children that they
will have different futures when they become men
and women. If we think about it, this difference is
created in the smallest and most everyday things.
How girls must dress, what games boys should play,
how girls need to talk softly or boys need to be tough.
All these are ways of telling children that they have
specific roles to play when they grow up to be men
and women. Later in life this affects the subjects we
can study or the careers we can choose.
In most societies, including our own, the roles men
and women play or the work they do, are not valued
equally. Men and women do not have the same
status. Let us look at how this difference exists in
the work done by men and women.

Valuing housework
Harmeet·s family did not think that the work Jaspreet
did within the house was real work. This feeling is
not unique to their families. Across the world, the
main responsibility for housework and care-giving
tasks, like looking after the family, especially
children, the elderly and sick members, lies with
women. Yet, as we have seen, the work that women
do within the home is not recognised as work. It is
also assumed that this is something that comes
naturally to women. It, therefore, does not have to
be paid for. And society devalues this work.

if your mother or those involved
in doing the work at home went

Why do you think that men and
boys generally do not do
housework? Do you think they
should?
Lives of domestic workers
In the story above, Harmeet·s mother was not the
only one who did the housework. A lot of the work
was done by Mangala, their domestic helper.
Many homes, particularly in towns and cities,
employ domestic workers. They do a lot of work ²
sweeping and cleaning, washing clothes and
dishes, cooking, looking after young children or
the elderly. Most domestic workers are women.
Sometimes, even young boys or girls are employed
to do this work. Wages are low, as domestic work
does not have much value. A domestic worker·s
day can begin as early as five in the morning and
end as late as twelve at night! Despite the hard
work they do, their employers often do not show
them much respect. This is what Melani, a
domestic worker had to say about her experience
of working in Delhi ² ´My first job was with a rich
family that lived in a three-storeyed house. The
memsahib was very strange as she would shout
to get any work done. My work was in the kitchen.
There were two other girls who did the cleaning.
Our day would begin at 5 o·clock. For breakfast
we would get a cup of tea and two dry rotis. We
could never get a third roti. In the evening, when
I cooked the food, the two other girls would beg
me to give them an extra roti. I would secretly
give it to them and make an extra one for myself.
We were so hungry after working through the day!
We could not wear chappals in the house. In the
winter, our feet would swell up with the cold. I
used to feel scared of the memsahib but also felt
angry and humiliated. Did we not work all day?
Did we not deserve to be treated with some
respect?µ
In fact, what we commonly term as housework
actually involves many different tasks. A number
of these tasks require heavy physical work. In
both rural and urban areas women and girls have
to fetch water. In rural areas women and girls
carry heavy headloads of firewood. Tasks like

washing clothes, cleaning, sweeping and picking up
loads require bending, lifting and carrying. Many
chores, like cooking, involve standing for long hours
in front of hot stoves. The work women do is
strenuous and physically demanding ³ words that
we normally associate with men.
Another aspect of housework and care-giving that
we do not recognise is that it is very time consuming.
In fact, if we add up the housework and the work,
women do outside the home, we find that women
spend much more time working than men and have
much less time for leisure.
Below is some data from a special study done
by the Central Statistical Organization of India
(1998²1999). See if you can fill in the blanks.
Women·s work and equality
As we have seen the low value attached to women·s
household and care-giving work is not an individual
or family matter. It is part of a larger system of
inequality between men and women. It, therefore,
has to be dealt with through actions not just at the
level of the individual or the family but also by the
government. As we now know, equality is an
important principle of our Constitution. The
Constitution says that being male or female should
not become a reason for discrimination. In reality,
inequality between the sexes exists. The government
is, therefore, committed to understanding the reasons
for this and taking positive steps to remedy the
situation. For example, it recognises that burden of
child-care and housework falls on women and girls.
What are the total number of work
hours spent by women in Haryana
and Tamil Nadu each week?
How does this compare with the
total number of work hours spent

This naturally has an impact on whether
girls can attend school. It determines
whether women can work outside the
house and what kind of jobs and careers
they can have. The government has set up
anganwadis or child-care centres in several
villages in the country. The government
has passed laws that make it mandatory
for organisations that have more than 30
women employees to provide crèche
facilities. The provision of crèches helps
many women to take up employment
outside the home. It also makes it possible
for more girls to attend schools.

Glossary
Identity: Identity is a sense of self-awareness of who one is. Typically, a person can have several
identities. For example, a person can be a girl, a sister and a musician.
Double-burden: Literally means a double load. This term is commonly used to describe the women·s
work situation. It has emerged from a recognition that women typically labour both inside the
home (housework) and outside.
Care-giving: Care-giving refers to a range of tasks related to looking after and nurturing. Besides
physical tasks, they also involve a strong emotional aspect.
De-valued: When someone is not given due recognition for a task or job they have done, they can
feel de-valued. For example, if a boy has put in a lot of effort into making a special birthday gift for
his friend and this friend does not say anything about this, then the boy may feel de-valued.

Breaking stereotypes
Engine drivers are men. But 27-year-old Laxmi Lakra, from a
poor tribal family in Jharkhand has begun to change things.
She is the first woman engine driver for Northern Railways.
Laxmi·s parents are not literate but they struggled and
overcame many hardships to make sure their children got an
education. Laxmi studied in a government school. Even in school,
Laxmi helped with the housework and did odd jobs. She studied
hard and did well and then went on to get a diploma in
electronics. She then took the railway board exam and passed
it on her first attempt.
Laxmi says, ´I love challenges and the moment somebody says it
is not for girls, I make sure I go ahead and do it.µ  Laxmi has had
to do this several times in her life ² when she wanted to take electronics; when she rode
motorcycles at the polytechnic; and when she decided to become an engine driver.
Her philosophy is simple ² ´As long as I am having fun without harming anyone, as long as I am
doing well and helping my parents,  why should I not lead a lifestyle of my choice?µ
(Adapted from Driving Her Train by Neeta Lal, Women·s Features Service)
Fewer opportunities and rigid expectations
A lot of the children in Rosie Ma·am·s class drew
women as nurses and men as army officers. The
reason they did this is because they feel that outside
the home too, women are good at only certain jobs.
For example, many people believe that women make
better nurses because they are more patient and
gentle. This is linked to women·s roles within the
family. Similarly, it is believed that science requires
a technical mind and girls and women are not capable
of dealing with technical things.
Because so many people believe in these
stereotypes, many girls do not get the same support
that boys do to study and train to become doctors
and engineers. In most families, once girls finish
school, they are encouraged by their families to see
marriage as their main aim in life.

Read the story below and answer
the questions ²
If you were Xavier, what subject
would you choose and why?
In your experience, what are some
of the other pressures that boys
experience?
Xavier was happy with the results of his Class X
board exams. Though his marks in Science and
Maths were not high, he had done well in his
favourite subjects ² History and Languages.  When
his parents saw his report card, however, they did
not look pleased at all...
My Goodness! Xavier,  you have
managed only 65% in Maths. Your marks
in Physics are low too...
I know Mama, but it·s
okay, because I don·t
want to take Maths or
Science. I want to
study History.
   Why do you want to take History?
Think about your future.
You have to get a good job!
    History will not help. It has no scope!
But, but, I don·t like
Maths or Science!
Be sensible, son. Take Maths, and you can
study computers side by side. The job market
for computers is very good.
It is important to understand that we live in a
society in which all children face pressures from the
world around them. Sometimes, these come in the
form of demands from adults. At other times, they
can just be because of unfair teasing by our own
friends. Boys are pressurised to think about getting
a job that will pay a good salary. They are also teased
and bullied if they do not behave like other boys.
You may remember that in your Class VI book you
read about how boys at an early age are encouraged
not to cry in front of others.

Ramabai (1858ĩ1922), shown above
with her daughter, championed the cause
of womenĬs education. She never went to
school but learnt to read and write from
her parents. She was given the title
īPanditaĬ because she could read and
write Sanskrit, a remarkable
achievement as women then were not
allowed such knowledge. She went on to
set up a Mission in Khedgaon near Pune
in 1898, where widows and poor women
were encouraged not only to become
literate but to be independent. They were
taught a variety of skills from carpentry
to running a printing press, skills that
are not usually taught to girls even today.
The printing press can be seen in the
picture on the top left corner. RamabaiĬs
Mission is still active today.
Learning for change
Going to school is an extremely important part of
your life. As more and more children enter school
every year, we begin to think that it is normal for all
children to go to school. Today, it is difficult for us
to imagine that school and learning could be seen
as ´out of boundsµ or not appropriate for some
children. But in the past, the skill of reading and
writing was known to only a few. Most children learnt
the work their families or elders did. For girls, the
situation was worse. In communities that taught sons
to read and write, daughters were not allowed to learn
the alphabet. Even in families where skills like
pottery, weaving and craft were taught, the
contribution of daughters and women was only seen
as supportive. For example, in the pottery trade,
women collected the mud and prepared the earth
for the pots. But since they did not operate the wheel,
they were not seen as potters.
In the nineteenth century, many new ideas about
education and learning emerged. Schools became
more common and communities that had never
learnt reading and writing started sending their
children to school. But there was a lot of opposition
to educating girls even then. Yet many women and
men made efforts to open schools for girls. Women
struggled to learn to read and write.

Social and Political Life
Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain and her dreams about ¶Ladyland·
Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880 ²1932) was born into a rich family who owned a lot of land.  Though
she knew how to read and write Urdu, she was stopped from learning Bangla and English. In those
days, English was seen as a language that would expose girls to new ideas, which people thought were
not correct for them. Therefore, it was mostly boys who were taught English. Rokeya learnt
to read and write Bangla and English with the support of her elder brother and an elder
sister.  She went on to become a writer. She wrote a remarkable story titled
Sultana·s Dream in 1905 to practise her English skills when she was merely 25
years old. This story imagined a woman called Sultana who reaches a place
called Ladyland. Ladyland is a place where women had the freedom to study,
work, and create inventions like controlling rain from the clouds and
flying air cars. In this Ladyland, the men had been sent into seclusion ²
their aggressive guns and other weapons of war defeated by the brain-
power of women. As Sultana travels in Ladyland with Sister Sarah,
she awakes to realise that she was only dreaming.
As you can see, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain was dreaming of
women flying planes and cars even before girls were being
allowed to go to school! This was the way in which education
and learning had changed Rokeya·s own life.  Rokeya did not
stop at getting education just for herself. Her education gave
her the power not only to dream and write, but also to do
more ² to help other girls go to school and to build their
own dreams.  In 1910, she started a school for girls in Kolkata,
and to this day, the school is still functioning.
Learning to read and write led some
women to question the situation of
women in society. They wrote stories,
letters and autobiographies describing
their own experiences of inequality. In
their writings, they also imagined new
ways of thinking and living for both
men and women.
Let us read about the experience of Rashsundari
Devi (1800²1890), who was born in West Bengal,
some 200 years ago. At the age of 60, she wrote her
autobiography in Bangla. Her book titled Amar Jiban
is the first known autobiography written by an Indian
woman. Rashsundari Devi was a housewife from a
rich landlord·s family. At that time, it was believed
that if a woman learnt to read and write, she would
bring bad luck to her husband and become a widow!
Despite this, she taught herself how to read and write
in secret, well after her marriage.
´I would start working at dawn, and I would still
be at it until well beyond midnight. I had no rest in
between. I was only fourteen years old at the time. I
came to nurture a great longing: I would learn to
read and I would read a religious manuscript. I was
55
Unlike Rashsundari Devi and Rokeya
Hossain, who were not allowed to learn
to read and write, large numbers of girls
attend school in India today. Despite this,
there continue to be many girls who leave
school for reasons of poverty, inadequate
schooling facilities and discrimination.
Providing equal schooling facilities to
children from all communities and class
backgrounds, and particularly girls,
continues to be a challenge in India.
unlucky, in those days women were not educated.
Later, I began to resent my own thoughts. What is
wrong with me? Women do not read, how will I do
it? Then I had a dream: I was reading the manuscript
of Chaitanya Bhagabat (the life of a saint)« Later in
the day, as I sat cooking in the kitchen, I heard my
husband say to my eldest son: ´Bepin, I have left my
Chaitanya Bhagabat here. When I ask for it, bring it
in.µ He left the book there and went away. When the
book had been taken inside, I secretly took out a
page and hid it carefully. It was a job hiding it, for
nobody must find it in my hands. My eldest son was
practising his alphabets at that time. I hid one of
them as well. At times, I went over that, trying to
match letters from that page with the letters that I
remembered. I also tried to match the words with
those that I would hear in the course of my days.
With tremendous care and effort, and over a long
period of time, I learnt how to read«µ
After learning the alphabet, Rashsundari Devi was
able to read the Chaitanya Bhagabat. Through her
own writing she also gave the world an opportunity
to read about women·s lives in those days.
Rashsundari Devi wrote about her everyday life
experiences in details. There were days when she
did not have a moment·s rest, no time even to sit
down and eat!
Schooling and education today
Today, both boys and girls attend school in large
numbers. Yet, as we will see, there still remain
differences between the education of boys and girls.
India has a census every 10 years, which counts the
whole population of the country. It also gathers
detailed information about the people living in
India ² their age, schooling, what work they do, and
so on. We use this information to measure many
things, like the number of literate people, and the
ratio of men and women. According to the 1961
census, about 40 per cent of all boys and men

What percentage of children leave
school at the upper primary level?
At which level of education do you
see the highest percentage of
children leaving?
Why do you think that the
percentage of Adivasi girls and
boys leaving school is higher than
that of any other group?
(7 years old and above) were literate (that is, they
could at least write their names) compared to just
15 per cent of all girls and women. In the most recent
census of 2011, these figures have grown to 82 per
cent for boys and men, and 65 per cent for girls and
women. This means that the proportion of both men
and women who are now able to read and have at
least some amount of schooling has increased. But,
as you can also see, the percentage of the male
group is still higher than the female group. The gap
has not gone away.
Here is a table that shows the percentage of girls
and boys who leave schools from different social
groups including Scheduled Caste (SC) and
Scheduled Tribe (ST).
(in percentage)
You have probably noticed in the above table that
SC and ST girls leave school at a rate that is higher
than the category ¶All Girls·. This means that girls
who are from Dalit (SC) and Adivasi (ST) backgrounds
are less likely to remain in school. The 2011 census
also found that Muslim girls are less likely, than SC
and ST girls, to complete primary school. While a
Muslim girl is likely to stay in school for around
three years, girls from other communities spend
around four years in school.
There are several reasons why children from Dalit,
Adivasi and Muslim communities leave school. In
many parts of the country, especially in rural and
poor areas, there may not even be proper schools
nor teachers who teach on a regular basis. If a school

is not close to people·s homes, and there is no
transport like buses or vans, parents may not be
willing to send their girls to school. Many families
are too poor and unable to bear the cost of educating
all their children. Boys may get preference in this
situation. Many children also leave school because
they are discriminated against by their teacher and
classmates.
Women·s movement
Women and girls now have the right to study and go
to school. There are other spheres ² like legal reform,
violence and health ² where the situation of women
and girls has improved. These changes have not
happened automatically. Women individually, and
collectively have struggled to bring about these
changes. This struggle is known as the Women·s
Movement. Individual women and women·s
organisations from different parts of the country are
part of the movement. Many men support the women·s
movement as well. The diversity, passion and efforts
of those involved makes it a very vibrant movement.
Different strategies have been used to spread
awareness, fight discrimination and seek justice.
Here are some glimpses of this struggle.

Campaigning
Campaigns to fight discrimination
and violence against women are an
important part of the women·s
movement. Campaigns have also led
to new laws being passed. A law was
made in 2006 to give women who face
physical and mental violence within
their homes, also called domestic
violence, some legal protection.
Similarly, efforts made by the
women·s movement led the Supreme
Court to formulate guidelines in 1997
to protect women against sexual
harassment at the workplace and
within educational institutions.
In the 1980s, for example, women·s
groups across the country spoke out
against ¶dowry deaths· ³ cases of
young brides being murdered by their
in-laws or husbands, greedy for more
dowry. Women·s groups spoke out
against the failure to bring these
cases to justice. They did so by
coming on to the streets, approaching
the courts, and by sharing
information. Eventually, this became
a public issue in the newspapers and
society, and the dowry laws were
changed to punish families who seek
dowry.
Satyarani, an active member of the womenĬs movement,
sitting on the steps of the Supreme Court surrounded by legal
files gathered during the course of a long legal battle to seek
justice for her daughter who was murdered for dowry.
Raising Awareness
An important part of the women·s
movements· work is to raise public
awareness on women·s rights issues.
Their message has been spread through
street plays, songs and public meetings.
Protesting
The women·s movement raises its voice when violations against women take place or
for example, when a law or policy acts against their interests. Public rallies and
demonstrations are a very powerful way of drawing attention to injustices.

Showing Solidarity
The women·s movement is also about showing
solidarity with other women and causes.

EXERCISES
Glossary
Stereotype: When we believe that people belonging to particular groups based on religion, wealth,
language are bound to have certain fixed characteristics or can only do a certain type of work, we
create a stereotype. For example, in this chapter, we saw how boys and girls are made to take
certain subjects not because he or she has an aptitude for it, but because they are either boys or
girls. Stereotypes prevent us from looking at people as unique individuals.
Discrimination: When we do not treat people equally or with respect we are indulging in
discrimination. It happens when people or organisations act on their prejudices. Discrimination
usually takes place when we treat some one differently or make a distinction.
Violation: When someone forcefully breaks the law or a rule or openly shows disrespect, we can
say that he or she has committed a violation.
Sexual harassment: This refers to physical or verbal behaviour that is of a sexual nature and
against the wishes of a woman.

Media
Teacher·s note
Today, the media and advertising are a
pervasive presence in the lives of young
people, who may or may not have taken
the opportunity to seriously reflect upon
this fact. This Unit offers some ways by
which we can begin to think about these.
The focus is on explaining the strong
links between media and technology and
media and big business.  It explains how
the media ¶sets the agenda· through
influencing our perception of issues
worth devoting time and attention to,
and issues that are neglected or
overridden.
Chapter 6 foregrounds the widespread
effects of the media, and attempts to
connect the issues under discussion to the
learner·s own lives.  At the end of the
chapter, we expect the learner to recognise
the role of big business in the media
coverage of events ³ the way ¶news· is
selected for coverage, and the explicit/
implicit dimensions of that coverage. We
use two fictitious news reports to
demonstrate that there is seldom just one
version of a story or an event.  Building on
this, we expect the learner to develop the
skills required to critically analyse a
newspaper report or a TV story through
scrutinising the information provided, as
well as understanding the logic behind the
exclusion of certain perspectives.
These ideas can be strengthened by
selecting 
examples 
from 
actual
advertisements and structuring similar
questions around them.
This chapter concludes by linking its
contents to the idea of democracy.  It
emphasises, through using examples of
local media as well as social advertising,
how mainstream media and advertising
tend to favour those who have greater
financial as well as social resources. This
point can be reinforced in the classroom
by using local examples of media stories,
as well as posing questions about the ways
in which advertising is changing what is
locally available as well as locally valued.

What is your favourite TV programme? What do you like listening to on
the radio?  Which newspaper or magazine do you usually read? Do you
surf the internet and what have you found most useful about it? Did you
know that there is one word that is often used to collectively refer to
the radio, TV, newspapers, Internet and several other forms of
communication. This word is ¶media·. In this chapter, you will read
more about the media. You will find out what is required to make it
work, as well as the ways in which the media affects our daily lives. Can
you think of one thing that you have learnt from the media this week?

List three things that you know

world from watching television?
Everything ranging from the stall at the local fair to
the programme that you see on TV can be called
media. Media is the plural form of the word ¶medium·
and it describes the various ways through which we
communicate in society. Because media refers to all
means of communication, everything ranging from
a phone call to the evening news on TV can be called
media. TV, radio and newspapers are a form of media
that reaches millions of people, or the masses, across
the country and the world and, thus, they are called
mass media.
Media and technology
It would probably be difficult for you to imagine your
life without the media. But cable television and the
widespread use of the Internet is a recent
phenomenon. These have been around for less than
twenty years. The technology that mass media uses
keeps changing.
Newspapers, television and radio can reach
millions of people because they use certain
technologies. We also tend to discuss newspapers
and magazines as the print media; and TV and radio
as the electronic media. Why do you think
newspapers are called print media? As you read
further, you will find that this naming is related to
the different technologies that these media use. The
following photographs will give you a sense of the
ways in which technology that mass media uses has
changed over the years and continues to change.
Changing technology, or machines, and making
technology more modern, helps media to reach more
people. It also improves the quality of sound and the
images that you see. But technology does more than
this. It also changes the ways in which we think about
our lives. For example, today it is quite difficult for
us to think of our lives without television. Television
has enabled us to think of ourselves as members of
a larger global world. Television images travel huge

distances through satellites and cables. This allows
us to view news and entertainment channels from
other parts of the world. Most of the cartoons that
you see on television are mostly from Japan or the
United States. We can now be sitting in Chennai or
Jammu and can see images of a storm that has hit
the coast of Florida in the United States. Television
has brought the world closer to us.
Media and money
The different technologies that mass media use are
expensive. Just think about the TV studio in which
the newsreader sits ² it has lights, cameras, sound
recorders, transmission satellites, etc., all of which
cost a lot of money.
In a news studio, it is not only the newsreader
who needs to be paid but also a number of other
people who help put the broadcast together. This
includes those who look after the cameras and lights.
Also, as you read earlier the technologies that mass
media use keep changing and so a lot of money is
spent on getting the latest technology. Due to these
costs, the mass media needs a great deal of money
to do its work. As a result, most television channels
and newspapers are part of big business houses.
Mass media is constantly thinking of ways to make
money. One way in which the mass media earns
money is by advertising different things like cars,
chocolates, clothes, mobile phones, etc. You must
have noticed the number of advertisements that you
have to see while watching your favourite television
show. While watching a cricket match on TV, the
same advertisements are shown repeatedly between
each over and so you are often watching the same
image over and over again. As you will read in the
following chapter, advertisements are repeated in the
hope that you will go out and buy what is advertised.
67
The cost to advertise on a TV channel
varies from  1,000 to  1,00,000 per
10 seconds depending on the popularity
of the channel and time.
Media and democracy
In a democracy, the media plays a very important
role in providing news and discussing events taking
place in the country and the world. It is on the basis
of this information that citizens can, for example,
learn how government works. And often, if they wish
to, they can take action on the basis of these news
stories. Some of the ways in which they can do this
is by writing letters to the concerned minister,
organising a public protest, starting a signature
campaign, asking the government to rethink its
programme, etc.
Given the role that the media plays in providing
information, it is important that the information be
balanced. Let us understand what we mean by a
balanced media report by reading two versions of
the same news event given on the next page.
Chapter 6: Understanding Media
The print media offers a large variety of
information to suit the tastes of different

If you read the story in the News

T
he closure of one lakh factories in the
cityŏs residential areas is likely to become
a serious issue. On Monday, thousands of factory
owners and workers took to the streets to strongly
protest this closure. They said that their
livelihoods would be lost. They say that the fault
lies with the municipal corporation because it
continued to issue licenses for new factories to
be set up in residential areas.They also say that
there were no adequate relocation efforts. The
owners and workers plan a one-day city bandh
to protest against this closure. Mr. Sharma, one
of the factory owners said, őThe government says
that it has done a lot to relocate us. But the areas
they have sent us to have no facilities and have
not been developed for the last five years.Œ

The fact is that if you had read either newspaper
you would only know one side of the story. If you
had read the News of India, you would most likely
think of the protestors as a nuisance. Their
disrupting traffic and continually polluting the city
with their factories leaves you with a bad impression
about them. But on the other hand, if you had read
the story in the India Daily, you would know that
the protests are because a lot of livelihoods will be
lost if the factories close because the relocation efforts
have not been adequate. Neither of these stories is a
balanced report. A balanced report is one that
discusses all points of view of a particular story and
then leaves it to the readers to make up their minds.
Writing a balanced report, however, depends on
the media being independent. An independent media
means that no one should control and influence its
coverage of news. No one should tell the media what

In many of our homes, TV is on a lot of the time. In many ways, a lot of our impressions
about the world around us are formed by what we see on TV: it is like a ¶window on the
world·. How do you think it influences us? TV has different types of programmes, soap
operas, like Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, game shows, like Kaun Banega Crorepati, reality TV
shows like Big Boss, news, sports and cartoons.
Before, in between and after each programme
are advertisements. Since TV time costs so much
money, only those programmes that can attract
the maximum number of viewers are shown. Can
you think of what such programmes might be?
Think of what are the kinds of things that TV
shows and what it does not. Does it show us
more about the lives of the rich or the poor?
We need to think about what TV does to us,
how it shapes our views of the world, our beliefs,
attitudes and values. We need to realise that it gives us a partial view of the world. While
we enjoy our favourite programmes, we should always be aware of the large exciting
world beyond our TV screens. There is so much happening out there that TV ignores.  A
world beyond film stars, celebrities and rich lifestyles, a world that all of us need to reach
out to and respond to in various ways. We need to be active viewers, who question
whatever we see and hear, while we may enjoy it too!
What does TV do to us and what can we do with TV?
Do you think it is important to
know both sides of the story?
Why?
Pretend that you are a journalist
for a newspaper and write a
balanced story from the two news
reports.
can be included and what should not be included in
a news story. An independent media is important in
a democracy. As you read above, it is on the basis of
the information that the media provides that we take
action as citizens, so it is important that this
information is reliable and not biased.
However, the reality is that media is far from
independent. This is mainly because of two reasons.
The first is the control that the government has on
the media. When the government prevents either a
news item, or scenes from a movie, or the lyrics of a
song from being shared with the larger public, this
is referred to as censorship. There have been periods
in Indian history when the government censored the
media. The worst of these was the Emergency
between 1975²1977.
Chapter 6: Understanding Media
70
Social and Political Life
 While the government does continue to censor
films, it does not really censor the media·s coverage
of news. Despite the absence of censorship by the
government, most newspapers nowadays still fail to
provide a balanced story. The reasons for this are
complicated. Persons who research the media have
said that this happens because business houses
control the media. At times, it is in the interest of
these businesses to focus on only one side of the
story. Media·s continual need for money and its links
to advertising means that it becomes difficult for
media to be reporting against people who give them
advertisements. Media is, thus, no longer considered
independent because of its close links to business.
Besides the above, the media also tends to focus
on a particular aspect of a story because they believe
this makes the story interesting. Also, if they want
to increase public support for an issue, they often
do this by focusing on one side of a story.
Setting agendas
The media also plays an important role in deciding
what stories to focus on, and therefore, decides on
what is newsworthy. For example, the annual
function at your school is unlikely to make the news.
But if a famous actor is invited as the Chief Guest,
then the media might be interested in covering it. By
focusing on particular issues, the media influences
our thoughts, feelings and actions, and brings those
issues to our attention. Due to the significant
influence it plays in our lives and in shaping our
thoughts, it is commonly said that the media ¶sets
the agenda·.
Very recently, the media drew our attention to
alarming levels of pesticides in cola drinks. They
published reports that indicated the high level of
pesticides and, thus, made us aware of the need to
regularly monitor these colas according to
international quality and safety standards. They did
71
Recognising that the media will not be interested in
covering ¶small· issues that involve ordinary people and
their daily lives, several local groups have come forward
to start their own media. Several people use community
radio to tell farmers about the prices of different crops
and advise them on the use of seeds and fertilisers.
Others make documentary films with fairly cheap and
easily available video cameras on real-life conditions
faced by different poor communities, and, at times, have
even given the poor these video cameras to make films
on their own lives.
Another example is a newspaper called Khabar Lahriya which is a fortnightly that is run by
eight Dalit women in Chitrakoot district in Uttar Pradesh. Written in the local language,
Bundeli, this eight-page newspaper reports on Dalit issues and cases of violence against
women and political corruption. The newspaper reaches farmers, shopkeepers, panchayat
members, school teachers and women who have recently learnt to read and write.
Local media
Fashion shows are very popular with the
media.
What is the consequence of the
media ¶setting the agenda· by
reporting on the Fashion Week
rather than the slum demolitions?
Can you think of an issue that
does not seem important to you
because it is never featured in the
media?
this despite the government·s resistance by boldly
declaring that colas were unsafe. In covering this
story, the media positively helped us focus on an
issue that affects our lives and one that we might
not even have been aware of it had it not been for
media reporting.
There are several instances when the media fails
to focus on issues that are significant in our lives.
For example, drinking water is a major problem in
the country. Every year, thousands of people suffer
and die because they do not get safe drinking water.
However, we seldom find the media discussing this
issue. A well-known Indian journalist wrote of how
the Fashion Week, in which clothes designers show
their new creations to rich people, formed the front
page headlines of all the newspapers while several
slums were being demolished in Mumbai, the very
same week, and this was not even noticed!
As citizens of a democracy, the media has a very
important role to play in our lives because it is
through the media that we hear about issues related
Chapter 6: Understanding Media
72
Social and Political Life
to the working of the government. The media decides
what to focus on and in this way it ¶sets the agenda·.
The government can, at times, prevent the media
from publishing a story and this is called censorship.
Nowadays, media·s close relationship with business
often means that a balanced report is difficult to come
by. Given this, it is important for us to be aware that
the ¶factual information· that a news report provides
is often not complete and can be one-sided. We,
therefore, need to analyse the news by asking the
following questions: what is the information I am
learning from this report? What information is not
being provided? From whose point of view is the
article being written? Whose point of view is being
left out and why?
Social advertising

Markets
Teacher·s note
These two chapters focus on aspects of
life and commercial cycles associated with
markets. While some of these processes
may be visible and, therefore, easily
observable, there are also others that are
relatively unfamiliar.
Chapter 7 discusses ¶Markets Around
Us·. At one level, we study different market
sites: a weekly market, neighbourhood
shops, a shopping complex, etc. At another
level, we explore the intricate question,
¶how do goods reach these markets?· We
examine how a chain of markets operates
and the role of wholesale markets within
this, through the case study of a wholesale
vegetable market. We usually associate
¶market· with marketplaces, but buying and
selling takes place in diverse ways and the
chapter discusses how all of this falls
within a larger understanding of markets.
Chapter 8 looks at how markets offer
people different opportunities. This is done
through the ¶story of a shirt·, and the chain
of markets involved in the process. Together
with understanding each step of the
manufacture and circulation of a shirt, we
realise that some people stand to gain in
the market transaction whereas others do
not gain as much, or none at all. The
opportunities are highly unequal. Ways do
exist, such as those of cooperative
marketing, which can provide a better
return to the producers. However, we need
to find many more viable avenues for
equitable distribution.
These chapters offer an opportunity of
bringing in the experience of local markets
for discussion in the classroom. A visit to
a wholesale market would be of interest,
and would allow the learner to find out the
profit margins and details of daily earnings
so that those inequalities can be directly
examined. The experiences of markets are
varied and also quite rich. Hence, one
should allocate time for some questions,
not addressed in the text, which students
may wish to discuss.

Markets Around Us
We go to the market to buy many things ² vegetables, soap, toothpaste, masala,
bread, rice, dal, clothes, notebooks, biscuits, etc. If we make a list of the goods
that we purchase, it would be really long. There are many kinds of markets that
we may visit for our everyday needs: these can include shops, hawker·s stalls in
our neighbourhood, a weekly market, a large shopping complex, perhaps even a
mall. In this chapter, we look at some of these markets and try to understand
how the goods that are sold there reach buyers, who these buyers are, who these
sellers are, and the sorts of problems they face.

Sameer is a small trader in the weekly
market. He buys clothes from a large
trader in the town and sells them in six
different markets in a week. He and
other cloth sellers move in groups. They
hire a mini van for this. His customers
are from villages that are near the
marketplace. At festival times, such as
during Deepavali or Pongal, he does
good business.
Sameer: Seller of clothes
Weekly market
A weekly market is so called because it is held on a
specific day of the week. Weekly markets do not have
permanent shops. Traders set up shops for the day
and then close them up in the evening.  Then they
may set up at a different place the next day. There
are thousands of such markets in India. People come
here for their everyday requirements.
Many things in weekly markets are available at
cheaper rates. This is because when shops are in
permanent buildings, they incur a lot of expenditure
² they have to pay rent, electricity, fees to the
government. They also have to pay wages to their
workers. In weekly markets, these shop owners store
the things they sell at home. Most of them are helped
by their family members and, hence, do not need to
hire workers. Weekly markets also have a large
number of shops selling the same goods which means
there is competition among them. If some trader were
to charge a high price, people would move to another
shop where the same thing may be available more
cheaply or where the buyer can bargain and bring
the price down.
One of the advantages of weekly markets is that
most things you need are available at one place.
Whether you want vegetables, groceries or cloth
items, utensils ² all of them can be found here. You
do not have to go to different areas to buy different
things. People also prefer going to a market where
they have a choice and a variety of goods.
Shops in the neighbourhood
We have seen that the weekly markets offer a variety
of goods. However, we also buy things from other
kinds of markets. There are many shops that sell
goods and services in our neighbourhoods. We may
buy milk from the dairy, groceries from departmental
stores, stationery, eatables or medicines from other

Sujata and Kavita were sent to buy
groceries from their neighbourhood
shop. This was the shop they usually
went to. It was crowded today. The
shop owner managed the shop
herself with two helpers. When they
managed to get into the shop, Sujata
dictated a list to her. She in turn
began asking her helpers to weigh
and pack the items. Meanwhile
Kavita looked around«
On the top left shelf there were
different brands of detergent cakes.
Another shelf had toothpastes,
talcum powder, shampoo, hair oil.
The different brands and different
colours looked so attractive.  On the
floor lay a few sacks.
It took almost 20 minutes to weigh
and pack all the groceries.  Then
Sujata showed her ´notebook.µ  The
woman noted the amount of
` 3000 in the notebook and gave it
back.  She also noted the amount
in her big register.  Then Sujata took the heavy bags out of the shop.  Her family will pay for the
purchases in the first week of next month.
Why did Sujata carry a notebook?

shops. Many of these are permanent shops, while
others are roadside stalls such as that of the
vegetable hawker, the fruit vendor, the mechanic,
etc.
Shops in the neighbourhood are useful in many
ways.  They are near our home and we can go there
on any day of the week.  Usually, the buyer and seller
know each other and these shops also provide goods
on credit. This means that you can pay for the
purchases later, as we saw in Sujata·s case, for
example.

Why do you think the guard
wanted to stop Kavita and Sujata
from entering the shop? What
would you say if someone stops
you from entering a shop in a
market?
You might have noticed that there are different
kinds of sellers even in the neighbourhood markets.
Some of them have permanent shops and others sell
their goods on the roadside.
Anzal Mall is a five-floor shopping
complex. Kavita and Sujata were
enjoying going up and down in
the lift.  It seemed as if it was
made of glass and they were able
to see outside as they went up.
It was fascinating to see so many
different kinds of shops such as
the ice-cream, burger, pizza and
other food shops; shops full of
home appliances; footwear and
leather items as well as
bookshops.
While wandering about on the
third floor they entered a shop
that was selling branded ready-
made clothes.The security guard
looked at them as if he wanted
to stop them but he did not say
anything. They looked at some
dresses and then looked at the
price tag. None of them was less
than ` 3,000, almost five times the weekly market price!  Sujata whispered to Kavita, ´I·ll take you to
another shop which has good quality ready-made clothes at more reasonable pricesµ.
Shopping complexes and malls
So far we have seen two kinds of marketplaces ²
weekly markets and markets in our neighbourhood.
There are other markets in the urban area that have
many shops, popularly called shopping complexes.
These days, in many urban areas, you also have large
multi-storeyed air-conditioned buildings with shops
on different floors, known as malls. In these urban
markets, you get both branded and non-branded
goods. As you have read in the chapter on advertising,
81
How do you think your
neighbourhood shop gets its
goods? Find out and explain with
some examples.
Why is a wholesale trader
necessary?
branded goods are expensive, often promoted by
advertising and claims of better quality. The
companies producing these products sell them
through shops in large urban markets and, at times,
through special showrooms. As compared to non-
branded goods, fewer people can afford to buy
branded ones.
Chain of markets
In the previous sections, you have read about
different markets from where we buy goods. From
where do you think shop-owners procure their goods?
Goods are produced in factories, on farms and in
homes. However, we don·t buy directly from the
factory or from the farm. Nor would the producers
be interested in selling us small quantities such as
one kilo of vegetables or one plastic mug.
The people in between the producer and the final
consumer are the traders. The wholesale trader first
buys goods in large quantities. For example, the
vegetable wholesale trader will not buy a few kilos of
vegetables, but will buy in large lots of 25 to 100
kilos. These will then be sold to other traders. In
these markets, buying and selling takes place
between traders. It is through these links of traders
that goods reach faraway places. The trader who
finally sells this to the consumer, is the retailer. This
could be a trader in a weekly market, a hawker in
the neighbourhood or a shop in a shopping complex.
We can understand this with the help of the
following examples ²
Every city has areas for wholesale markets. This
is where goods first reach and are then supplied to
other traders. The roadside hawker whom you read
about earlier would have purchased a large quantity
of plastic items from a wholesale trader in the town.
He, in turn, might have bought these from another,
even bigger wholesale trader in the city. The city

Aftab is one of the wholesale traders who purchases in bulk. His
business starts around 2 o·clock in the morning when vegetables
reach the market. This is the time when the vegetable market or
mandi starts buzzing with activity. The vegetables come in trucks,
matadors, tractor trolleys from farms both near and far. Soon the
process of auctions begins. Aftab participates in this auction and
decides what he will buy.  Today, for example, he bought 5 quintals of
cauliflower, 10 quintals of onions. He has a shop in the market where
he stores the vegetables that he has bought. From here he sells to
hawkers and shopkeepers who start coming to the market around
six in the morning. They have to organise their purchases so that
they can start their shop for the day around ten in the morning.
Aftab ²The wholesaler in the city
wholesale trader would have bought a large quantity
of plastic items from the factory and stored them in
a godown. In this way, a chain of markets is set up.
When we purchase, we may not be aware of the chain
of markets through which these goods travel before
they reach us.
Markets everywhere
So far we have seen different marketplaces where
people buy and sell a variety of goods and services.
All these markets are in a specific locality and work
in a particular manner and time. However, it is not
always necessary that one has to go to the market to
purchase goods. You can place orders for a variety
of things through the phone and these days through
the Internet, and the goods are delivered at your
home. In clinics and nursing homes, you may have
noticed sales representatives waiting for doctors.
Such persons are also engaged in the selling of goods.
Thus, buying and selling takes place in different
ways, not necessarily through shops in the market.
The markets that we looked at above are the ones
that we recognise easily. However, there are markets
that we may not be so aware of. This is because a
83
People in urban areas can enter markets
without stepping out of their homes via
the Internet. They use their credit cards to
make īonline purchasesĬ.
large number of goods are bought and sold that we
don·t use directly. For example, a farmer uses
fertilisers to grow crops that he purchases from
special shops in the city and they, in turn get them
from factories.  A car factory purchases engine, gears,
petrol tanks, axles, wheels, etc., from various other
factories. We don·t usually see all the buying and
selling, but only the final product ² the car in the
showroom. The story is similar for any other good.
Markets and equality
In this chapter, we have looked at shop owners in a
weekly market and those in a shopping complex.
They are very different people. One is a small trader
with little money to run the shop whereas the other
is able to spend a lot of money to set up the shop.
They also earn unequal amounts. The weekly market
trader earns little compared to the profit of a regular
shop owner in a shopping complex. Similarly, buyers
are differently placed. There are many who are not
able to afford the cheapest of goods while others are
busy shopping in malls. Thus, whether we can be
buyers or sellers in these different markets depends,
among other things, on the money that we have.
We have also examined  the chain of markets that
is formed before goods can reach us. It is through

created for people to earn. However, do they offer
equal opportunities? We will try to understand this

Did Swapna get a fair price on the
cotton?
Why did the trader pay Swapna
a low price?
Where do you think large farmers
would sell their cotton? How is
their situation different from
Swapna?
A cotton farmer in Kurnool
Swapna, a small farmer in Kurnool (Andhra Pradesh)
grows cotton on her small piece of land. The bolls of
the cotton plant are ripe and some have already
burst, so Swapna is busy picking cotton. The bolls,
which carry the cotton in them, do not burst open
all at once so it takes several days to harvest the
cotton.
Once the cotton is collected, instead of selling it at
Kurnool cotton market, Swapna and her husband
take the harvest to the local trader. At the beginning
of the cropping season, Swapna had borrowed
` 2,500 from the trader at a very high interest rate
to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides for cultivation.
At that time, the local trader made Swapna agree to
another condition. He made her promise to sell all
her cotton to him.
Cultivation of cotton requires high levels of inputs
such as fertilisers and pesticides and the farmers
have to incur heavy expenses on account of these.
Most often, the small farmers need to borrow money
to meet these expenses.
At the trader·s yard, two of his men weigh the
bags of cotton. At a price of ` 1,500 per quintal, the
cotton fetches ` 6,000. The trader deducts
` 3,000 for repayment of loan and interest and pays
Swapna ` 3,000.
Swapna: ` 3,000 only!
Trader: Cotton is selling cheap. There is a lot of
cotton in the market.
Swapna: I have toiled so hard for four months to
grow this cotton. You can see how fine and clean the
cotton is this time. I had hoped to get a much better
price.

Trader: Amma, I am giving you a good price. Other
traders are not even paying this much. You can check
at the Kurnool market, if you do not believe me.
Swapna: Don·t be angry. How can I doubt you? I had
only hoped that we would earn enough from the
cotton crop to last us a few months.
Though Swapna knows that cotton will sell for at
least ` 1,800 per quintal, she doesn·t argue further.
The trader is a powerful man in the village and the
farmers have to depend on him for loans not only for
cultivation, but also to meet other exigencies such
as illnesses, children·s school fees. Also, there are
times in the year when there is no work and no
income for the farmers, so borrowing money is the
only means of survival.
Swapna·s earning from cotton cultivation is barely
more than what she might have earned as a wage
labourer.
The cloth market of Erode
Erode·s bi-weekly cloth market in Tamil Nadu is one
of the largest cloth markets in the world. A large
variety of cloth is sold in this market. Cloth that is
made by weavers in the villages around is also
brought here for sale. Around the market are offices
of cloth merchants who buy this cloth. Other traders
from many south Indian towns also come and
purchase cloth in this market.
 On market days, you would also find weavers
bringing cloth that has been made on order from the
merchant. These merchants supply cloth on order
to garment manufacturers and exporters around the
country. They purchase the yarn and give
instructions to the weavers about the kind of cloth
that is to be made. In the following example, we can
see how this is done.
89
1.This is a merchantĬs shop in the bazaar.
Over the years, these traders have
developed extensive contacts with
garment firms around the country from
whom they get orders. These traders
purchase the yarn (thread) from others.
2. The weavers live in villages around
and take the yarn supplied by these
traders to their homes where the looms
are located in sheds adjacent to their
houses. This photograph shows a
powerloom in one such home.
The weavers and their families spend
long hours working on these looms.
Most weaving units have about  2ĩ8
powerlooms on which the yarn is woven
into cloth. A variety of sarees, towels,
shirting, ladies dress material and
bedsheets are produced in these looms.
3. They then bring back the finished cloth
to the traders. Here, they can be seen
getting ready to go to the merchant in the
town. The trader keeps an account of the
yarn given and pays them money for
weaving this into cloth.

What are the following people
doing at the Erode cloth market²
merchants, weavers, exporters?
In what ways are weavers
dependent on cloth merchants?
Putting-out system² weavers producing
cloth at home
The merchant distributes work among the weavers
based on the orders he has received for cloth. The
weavers get the yarn from the merchant and supply
him the cloth. For the weavers, this arrangement
seemingly has two advantages. The weavers do not
have to spend their money on purchase of yarn. Also,
the problem of selling the finished cloth is taken care
of. Weavers know from the outset what cloth they
should make and how much of it is to be woven.
However, this dependence on the merchants both
for raw materials and markets means that the
merchants have a lot of power. They give orders for
what is to be made and they pay a very low price for
making the cloth. The weavers have no way of

Social and Political Life
Weaver·s cooperative
We have seen that the weavers are paid very little by the
merchant under the putting out system. Weaver·s cooperatives
are one way to reduce the dependence on the merchant and to
earn a higher income for the weavers.  In a cooperative, people
with common interests come together and work for their mutual
benefit. In a weaver·s cooperative, the weavers form a group and
take up certain activities collectively. They procure yarn from
the yarn dealer and distribute it among the weavers. The
cooperative also does the marketing. So, the role of the merchant
is reduced, and weavers get a fair price on the cloth.
At times, the government helps the cooperatives by buying cloth from them at a reasonable
price. For instance, the Tamil Nadu government runs a Free School Uniform programme in
the state. The government procures the cloth for this programme from the powerloom weaver·s
cooperatives.  Similarly, the government buys cloth from the handloom weaver·s cooperatives
and sells it through stores known as Co-optex. You might have come across one of these
stores in your town.
If the weavers were to buy yarn on
their own and sell cloth, they
would probably earn three times
more. Do you think this is
possible? How? Discuss.

knowing who they are making the cloth for or at
what price it will be sold. At the cloth market, the
merchants sell the cloth to the garment factories. In
this way, the market works more in favour of the
merchants.
Weavers invest all their savings or borrow money
at high interest rates to buy looms. Each loom costs
` 20,000, so a small weaver with two looms has to
invest ` 40,000. The work on these looms cannot be
done alone. The weaver and another adult member
of his family work upto 12 hours a day to produce
cloth. For all this work, they earn about
` 3,500 per month.
The arrangement between the merchant and the
weavers is an example of putting-out system,
whereby the merchant supplies the raw material and
receives the finished product. It is prevalent in the
weaving industry in most regions of India.

demands?
How do the garment exporters

foreign buyers?
The garment exporting factory near Delhi
The Erode merchant supplies the cotton cloth
produced by the weavers to a garment exporting
factory near Delhi. The garment exporting factory
will use the cloth to make shirts. The shirts will be
exported to foreign buyers. Among the foreign buyers
are businesspersons from the US and Europe who
run a chain of stores. These large stores do business
strictly on their own terms. They demand the lowest
prices from the supplier. In addition, they set high
standards for quality of production and timely
delivery. Any defects or delay in delivery is dealt with
strictly. So, the exporter tries his best to meet the
conditions set by these powerful buyers.
Faced with such pressures from the buyers, the
garment exporting factories, in turn, try to cut costs.
They get the maximum work out of the workers at
the lowest possible wages. This way they can
maximise their own profits and also supply the
garments to foreign buyers at a cheap price.

whenever the employer feels that a worker is not
needed, the worker can be asked to leave. Workers·

Who are the gainers in the market?
A chain of markets links the producer of cotton to
the buyer at the supermarket. Buying and selling
takes place at every step in the chain. Let us recall
who were the people who were involved in this
process of buying and selling. Did they all gain as
much? There were people who made profits in the
market and there were some who did not gain as
much from this buying and selling. Despite their
having toiled very hard, they earned little. Can you
place them in the table shown here?
Market and equality
The foreign businessperson made huge profits in the
market. Compared to this, the garment exporter
made only moderate profits. On the other hand, the
earnings of the workers at the garment export factory
are barely enough to cover their day-to-day needs.
Similarly, we saw the small cotton farmer and the
weaver at Erode put in long hours of hard work. But
they did not get a fair price in the market for what
they produced. The merchants or traders are
somewhere in between. Compared to the weavers,
they have earned more but it is still much less than
the exporter. Thus, not everyone gains equally in
the market. Democracy is also about getting a fair
wage in the market. Whether it is Kanta or Swapna,
if families don·t earn enough how would they think
of themselves as equal to others?
On one hand, the market offers people
opportunities for work and to be able to sell things
that they grow or produce. It could be the farmer
selling cotton or the weaver producing cloth. On the
other hand, it is usually the rich and the powerful

that get the maximum earnings from the market.
These are the people who have money and own the
factories, the large shops, large land holdings, etc.
The poor have to depend on the rich and the powerful
for various things. They have to depend for loans (as
in the case of Swapna, the small farmer), for raw
materials and marketing of their goods (weavers in
the putting out system), and most often for
employment (workers at the garment factory).
Because of this dependence, the poor are exploited
in the market. There are ways to overcome these such
as forming cooperatives of producers and ensuring
that laws are followed strictly.

Equality in Indian Democracy
Teacher·s note
This Unit introduces the learner to the
critical role of equality in democracy, with
specific reference to India. The Constitution
of India guarantees equality to all citizens.
Despite this, the daily lives of people in
India are far from equal. Earlier
discussions on equality in Civics textbooks
most often reiterated certain provisions of
the Constitution without adequately
considering the reality of these in people·s
lives. This Unit adopts a different approach.
It discusses the need for equality through
highlighting the inequalities that continue
to be practised and experienced by various
communities.
The government·s role in passing laws and
instituting policies is discussed to show that
commitment to the alleviation of existing
inequalities is a major part of the work that
governments undertake. The chapter also
briefly introduces an issue of inequality in
the United States of America to highlight
that this is a global phenomenon and a
feature of many democratic countries.
This chapter aims to help the learner
understand that equality and democracy
are dynamic and not static concepts. This
dynamism is reflected in the government·s
passing of new laws and programmes, and
in people·s movements around various
social and economic issues.
Local situations should be used as a
practical reference to make the discussion
on underlying concepts more relevant and
appropriate. A discussion on equality in the
classroom requires empathy as well as a
firm commitment on the teacher·s part to
ensuring that the dignity of all learners be
respected.

CHAPTER
On Equality
Equality in Indian democracy
The Indian Constitution recognises every person as
equal. This means that every individual in the
country, including male and female persons from
all castes, religions, tribes, educational and economic
backgrounds are recognised as equal. This is not to
say that inequality ceases to exist. It doesn·t. But
atleast, in democratic India, the principle of the
equality of all persons is recognised. While earlier
no law existed to protect people from discrimination
and ill-treatment, now there are several that work to
see that people are treated with dignity and as equals.
This recognition of equality includes some of the
following provisions in the Constitution: first that
every person is equal before the law. What this means
is that every person, from the President of the country
to Kanta, a domestic worker, has to obey the same
laws. Second, no person can be discriminated against
on the basis of their religion, race, caste, place of
birth or whether they are female or male. Third, every
person has access to all public places including
playgrounds, hotels, shops and markets. All persons
can use publicly available wells, roads and bathing
ghats. Fourth, untouchability has been abolished.
Can you think of an incident in
your life in which your dignity was
violated? How did this make you
feel?
In the 1975 film, Deewar, a boy who
works as a shoeshine refuses to pick up a
coin thrown at him. He feels that there
is dignity in the work that he does and
insists that his fee be given respectfully.

Social and Political Life
children would often go home for lunch and then not
return to school but now with the midday meal being
provided in school, their attendance has improved.
Their mothers, who earlier had to interrupt their work
to feed their children at home during the day, now
no longer need to do so. This programme has also
helped reduce caste prejudices because  children of
all castes in the school eat this meal together, and in
quite a few places, Dalit women have been employed
to cook the meal. The midday meal programme also
helps reduce the hunger of poor students who often
come to school and cannot concentrate because their
stomachs are empty.
While government programmes play an important
role in increasing equality of opportunity, there is much
that still needs to be done. While the midday meal
programme has helped increase the enrolment and
attendance of poor children in school, there continues
to be big differences in our country between schools
that the rich attend and those that the poor attend.
Even today there are several schools in the country in
which Dalit children are discriminated against and
treated unequally. These children are forced into
unequal situations in which their dignity is not
respected. This is because people refuse to think of
them as equal even though the law requires it.
One of the main reasons for this is that attitudes
change very slowly. Even though persons are aware
that discrimination is against the law, they continue
to treat people unequally on the basis of their caste,
religion, disability, economic status and because they
are women. It is only when people begin to believe
that no one is inferior, and that every person deserves
to be treated with dignity, that present attitudes can
change. Establishing equality in a democratic society
is a continuous struggle and one in which individuals
as well as various communities in India contribute to
and you will read more about this in this book.
Issues of equality in other democracies
You are probably wondering whether India is the only
democratic country in which there is inequality and

where the struggle for equality continues to exist.
The truth is that in many democratic countries
around the world, the issue of equality continues to
be the key issue around which communities struggle.
So, for example, in the United States of America, the
African²Americans whose ancestors were the slaves
who were brought over from Africa, continue to
describe their lives today as largely unequal. This,
despite the fact that there was a movement in the
late 1950s to push for equal rights for African²
Americans. Prior to this, African²Americans were
treated extremely unequally in the United States and
denied equality through law. For example, when
travelling by bus, they either had to sit at the back of
the bus or get up from their seat whenever a white
person wished to sit.
Rosa Parks (1913²2005) was an African²American
woman. Tired from a long day at work she refused to give
up her seat on a bus to a white man on 1 December 1955.
Her refusal that day started a huge agitation against
the unequal ways in which African²Americans were
treated and which came to be known as the Civil
Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964
prohibited discrimination on the basis of race,
religion or national origin. It also stated that all
schools would be open to African²American children
and that they would no longer have to attend
ĮIt is disgraceful to live at the cost of
one's self-respect. Self-respect is the most
vital factor in life. Without it, man is a
cipher. To live worthily with self-
respect, one has to overcome difficulties.
It is out of hard and ceaseless struggle
alone that one derives strength,
confidence and recognition.
ĮMan is mortal. Everyone has to die
some day or the other. But one must
resolve to lay down one's life in
enriching the noble ideals of self-respect
and in bettering one's human life...
Nothing is more disgraceful for a brave
man than to live life devoid of self-
respect.į

separate schools specially set up for them. However,
despite this, a majority of African²Americans
continue to be among the poorest in the country.
Most African-American children can only afford to
attend government schools that have fewer facilities
and poorly qualified teachers as compared to white
students who either go to private schools or live in
areas where the government schools are as highly
rated as private schools.
Challenge of democracy
No country can be described as being completely
democratic. There are always communities and
individuals trying to expand the idea of democracy
and push for a greater recognition of equality on
existing as well as new issues. Central to this is the
struggle for the recognition of all persons as equal
and for their dignity to be maintained. In this book
you will read about how this issue of equality affects
various aspects of our daily lives in democratic India.
As you read these chapters, think about whether
the equality of all persons and their being able to
maintain their dignity is upheld.
Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
(1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race,
caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.
(2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of
them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to ²
(a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment;

(b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained
wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.

Teacher·s note
These two chapters (Chapters 2 and 3) on
State Government are an attempt to
discuss the functions and structure of
government through concrete situations.
We have chosen ¶health· as an example;
there could have been other, equally
important, choices.
Chapter 2 discusses ¶health· as an
important issue for people. There are both
public and private aspects of health
provisioning. Healthcare in India is not
available to all. While the Constitution
supports a view that the right to health is
an aspect of our fundamental rights, its
provisioning is rather unequal. Through
the accounts provided, learners will begin
to visualise the ideal or desired role of
government, and the meanings behind its
structures. Some ways in which this
situation can be changed are also
discussed.
Chapter 3 focuses on how the
government functions, and discusses ideas
of representation, accountability and
public welfare. Though both the executive
and the legislature are presented, one
should not expect students to retain fine
distinctions. It would be best to patiently
encourage them to ask questions such as,
´Who is the most powerful person?µ, ´Why
can·t the MLA solve the problem?µ, etc.
Such queries will enable them to construct
a sense of the government apparatus.
It is important that learners acquire the
confidence to express their views on public
issues and understand the role of
government through the exercises given in
the chapters. You could choose familiar
issues such as water, transport, school-
fees, books, child-labour, etc., for them to
discuss and arrive at how these problems
need to be tackled. Allow them to express
these ideas through wall charts. Given that
discussions on the government and its
functioning often lead to boredom and
cynicism, we need to be able to make
the classroom session less didactic and
more interactive while teaching these
lessons.

What is health?
We can think of health in many ways. Health means
our ability to remain free of illness and injuries. But
health isn·t only about disease. You may have
associated only some of the situations in the above
collage with health. What we often ignore is the fact
that each of the above situations is related to health.
Apart from disease, we need to think of other factors
that affect our health. For example, if people get clean
drinking water or a pollution free environment they
are likely to be healthy. On the other hand, if people
do not get adequate food to eat or have to live in
cramped conditions, they will be prone to illness.
All of us would like to be active and in good spirits
in whatever we may be doing. It isn·t healthy to be
dull, inactive, anxious or scared for long stretches of
time. We all need to be without mental strain. All of
these various aspects of our lives are a part of health.
Pick two situations from the above
collage that are not related to
illness and write two sentences on
how they are related to health.
Would you associate all or some of
these pictures with ¶health· ? In
what ways? Discuss in groups.
Chapter 2: Role of the Government in Health
15
Patients usually have to wait in long
queues in government hospitals, like
this one.
India has a large number of doctors, clinics and
hospitals. The country also has considerable
experience and knowledge in running a public
healthcare system. This is a system of hospitals and
health centres run by the government. It has the
ability to look after the health of a large section of
its population scattered over hundreds of thousands
of villages. We will go into more detail on this later.
Moreover, there has been a phenomenal
advancement in medical sciences whereby many new
technologies and treatment procedures are available
in the country.
However, the second column points out how poor
the health situation in our country is. With all the
above positive developments we are not able to provide
proper healthcare facilities to people. This is the
paradox ² something that is contrary to what we
would expect. Our country has the money, knowledge
and people with experience but cannot make the
necessary healthcare available to all. In this chapter,
we will look at some of the reasons for this.

Aman and Ranjan are good friends. While Ranjan
comes from a well-to-do family, Aman·s parents have
to struggle to make ends meet...
Hi Aman! Good to
see you back! How have
you been?
I had viral fever and
had to go to the
hospital...
Oh! Me, too! I just got back to
school on Monday. My Daddy
took me to see the doctor
at the new hospital in
Kingsway. It was very exciting!
The building looked so posh. I thought it
was a five star hotel! Daddy said that was
because it was a private hospital, with the
best of facilities.
Daddy had to pay Rs 500 at the reception counter
itself ² before we even met the doctor! There was
nice music playing and everything was really clean
and shiny.
The doctor asked for many tests...but
everyone was so friendly! The lady who took
my blood for testing told me so many jokes
that I forgot to feel the pain!
...and have you
heard the one
about Batman
on Reality TV?
After the test results came, we went back to the
doctor. He looked through them and said everything
was fine, and I only had viral fever. He prescribed some
medicines and rest.
...and so young man ² this pink pill should be
taken three times a day, and the white tablet
once before bed time ² that·s for the
bodyache! This one is a syrup ² don·t
worry, it·s tasty

you go to?
Um...it wasn·t as nice as your·s
at all! At first, Abba didn·t want
to take me because he said it
would take too much time...
When our turn came, the doctor examined me, and
asked for a blood test. Then we had to go and stand in
another long queue! People were crowding around in
the testing room too.
We got the test results after three days...and went
back to the hospital. There was a different doctor
that day.
Show me his OPD
card...and the test results
² quickly please!
He seems to be suffering from
a bout of viral fever ² nothing
to worry about.  All he needs
is this one fever-reducing
medicine.
My hospital was nice, but
they gave me many medicines
and the whole thing
cost quite a lot!
Oh! My treatment
did not cost much!
...and it really did! We went to a big

Public and private health care services
From the above story, you must have understood
that we can roughly divide up various health care
facilities in two categories ²
(a) Public health services and
(b) Private health facilities.
Public health services
The public health service is a chain of health centres
and hospitals run by the government. They are linked
together so that they cover both rural and urban
areas and can also provide treatment to all kinds of
problems ² from common illnesses to special services.
At the village level there are health centres where
there is usually a nurse and a village health worker.
They are trained in dealing with common illnesses
and work under the supervision of doctors at the
Primary Health Centre (PHC). Such a centre covers
many villages in a rural area. At the district level is
the District Hospital that also supervises all the health
centres. Large cities have many government hospitals
such as the one where Aman was taken and also
specialised government hospitals.
The health service is called ¶public· for many
reasons. In order to fulfil its commitment of providing
health care to all citizens, the government has
established these hospitals and health centres. Also,
the resources needed to run these services are
obtained from the money that we, the public, pay to
the government as taxes. Hence, such facilities are
meant for everyone. One of the most important
aspects of the public health system is that it is meant
to provide quality health care services either free or
at a low cost, so that even the poor can seek
treatment. Another important function of public
health is to take action to prevent the spread of
diseases such as TB, malaria, jaundice, cholera,
Why pay taxes to the government?
Government uses tax money for
providing many public services for
the benefit of all citizens. Some
services such as defence, police,
judicial system, highways etc.
benefit all citizens. Otherwise, the
citizens cannot organise these
services for themselves.
Taxes fund developmental
programmes and services such as
education, health care,
employment, social welfare,
vocational training etc. required for
needy citizens. Tax money is
utilised for relief and rehabilitation
in case of natural disasters such as
floods, earthquakes, tsunami etc.
Space, nuclear, and missile
programmes are also funded from
the revenues collected as taxes.
Government provides some
services especially for the poor
who cannot afford to purchase
them from the market. One
example is health care. Can you
give other examples?

In what ways is the public health
system meant for everyone?
List some Primary Health Centres
(PHCs) or hospitals near your place.

visiting any one of them), find out

diarrhoea, chikungunya, etc. This has to be
organised by the government with the participation
of people otherwise it is not effective. For example,
when taking up a campaign to see that mosquitoes
do not breed in water coolers, rooftops, etc., this
has to be done for all houses in the area.
According to our Constitution, it is the primary
duty of the government to ensure the welfare of the
people and provide health care facilities to all.
The government must safeguard the Right to Life
of every person. If a hospital cannot provide timely
medical treatment to a person, it means that this
protection of life is not being given.
The Court also said that it was the duty of the
government to provide the necessary health services,
including treatment in emergency situations.
Hospitals and medical staff must fulfil their duty of
providing the necessary treatment. Therefore, the
Court asked the State Government to give him the
money that he had spent on his treatment.
Private health facilities
There is a wide range of private health facilities that
exist in our country. A large number of doctors run
their own private clinics. In the rural areas, one
finds Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs). Urban
areas have a large number of doctors, many of them
providing specialised services. There are hospitals
and nursing homes that are privately owned. There
are many laboratories that do tests and offer special
facilities such as X-ray, ultrasound, etc. There are
also shops from where we buy medicines.
As the name suggests, private health facilities
are not owned or controlled by the government.
Unlike the public health services, in private
facilities, patients have to pay a lot of money for
every service that they use.

Social and Political Life
Today the presence of private facilities can be seen
all around. In fact now there are large companies
that run hospitals and some are engaged in
manufacturing and selling medicines. Medical shops
are found in every corner of the country.
Healthcare and equality:
Is adequate healthcare available to all?
In India, we face a situation where private services
are increasing but public services are not. What is
then available to people are mainly private services.
These are concentrated in urban areas. The cost of
these services is rather high. Medicines are
expensive. Many people cannot afford them or have
to borrow money when there is an illness in the
family.
Some private services encourage incorrect
practices to earn more. At times inexpensive
alternatives, though available, may not be used. For
example, some medical practitioners are found to
prescribe superfluous medicines, injections or saline
when simple medication may suffice.
 In fact, barely 20 per cent of the population can
afford all the medicines that they require during an
illness. Hence, even for those whom one might not

think as being poor, medical expenses cause
hardship. It was reported in a study that 40 per
cent of people who are admitted to a hospital for
some illness or injury have to borrow money or sell
some of their possessions to pay for the expenses.
For those who are poor, every illness in the family
is a cause of great anxiety and distress. What is worse
is that this situation tends to happen again and
again. Those who are poor are in the first place
undernourished. These families are not eating as
much as they should. They are not provided basic
necessities like drinking water, adequate housing,
clean surroundings, etc., and therefore, are more
likely to fall ill. The expenses on illness make their
situation even worse.
Sometimes it is not only the lack of money that
prevents people from getting proper medical
treatment. Women, for example, are not taken to a
doctor in a prompt manner. Women·s health
concerns are considered to be less important than
the health of men in the family. Many tribal areas
have few health centres and they do not run properly.
Even private health services are not available.
What can be done?
There is little doubt that the health situation of most
people in our country is not good. It is the
responsibility of the government to provide quality
healthcare services to all its citizens, especially the
poor and the disadvantaged. However, health is as
much dependent on basic amenities and social
conditions of the people, as it is on healthcare
services. Hence, it is important to work on both in
order to improve the health situation of our people.
And this can be done. Look at the following example.

The Kerala experience
In 1996, the Kerala government made some major
changes in the state. Forty per cent of the entire state
budget was given to panchayats. They could plan
and provide for their requirements. This made it
possible for a village to make sure that proper
planning was done for water, food, women·s
development and education. This meant that water
supply schemes were checked, the working of schools
and anganwadis was ensured and specific problems
of the village were taken up. Health centres were
also improved. All of this helped to improve the
situation. Despite these efforts, however, some
problems ² such as shortage of medicines,
insufficient hospital beds, not enough doctors ²
remained, and these needed to be addressed.

Let us look at an example of another country and
its approach to issues of health.
The Costa Rican approach
Costa Rica is considered to be one of the healthiest
countries in Central America. The main reason for
this can be found in the Costa Rican Constitution.
Several years ago, Costa Rica took a very important
decision and decided not to have an army. This
helped the Costa Rican government to spend the
money that the army would have used, on health,
education and other basic needs of the people. The
Costa Rican government believes that a country has
to be healthy for its development and pays a lot of
attention to the health of its people. The Costa Rican
government provides basic services and amenities
to all Costa Ricans. For example, it provides safe
drinking water, sanitation, nutrition and housing.
Health education is also considered very important
and knowledge about health is an essential part of
education at all levels.

government. In this way we say that the MLAs
represent people. The example below will help us
understand this better.
Every state in India has a Legislative Assembly.
Each state is divided into different areas or
constituencies. For example, look at the map below.
It shows that the state of Himachal Pradesh is divided
into 68 assembly constituencies. From each
constituency, the people elect one representative who
then becomes a Member of the Legislative Assembly
(MLA). You would have noticed that people stand for
elections in the name of different parties. These MLAs,
therefore, belong to different political parties.
How do people who are MLAs become ministers or
chief minister? A political party whose MLAs have
won more than half the number of constituencies in
a state can be said to be in a majority. The political
party that has the majority is called the ruling party
and all other members are called the opposition. For
example, the Legislative Assembly of the state of
Himachal Pradesh has 68 MLA constituencies.

At times, the ruling party may not
be a single party but a group of
parties working together. This is
called a coalition. Discuss with
your teacher.
Candidates from various political parties won the
2017 assembly elections and became MLAs. Since
the total number of MLAs in the Legislative Assembly
is 68, a political party would have needed to have
more than 34 MLAs in order to gain a majority. The
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with 44 MLAs had the
majority and it became the ruling party. All other MLAs
became the opposition. In this case, the Indian National
Congress (INC) was the major opposition party, since it
had the largest number of MLAs after the BJP. Among
the opposition were other parties, including those who
had been elected as independent candidates.
After the elections, the MLAs belonging to the
ruling party will elect their leader who will become
the chief minister. In this case, the BJP MLAs chose
Shri Jairam Thakur as their leader and he became
the chief minister. The chief minister then selects
other people as ministers. After the elections, it is
the Governor of the state who appoints the chief
minister and other ministers.
The chief minister and other ministers have the
responsibility of running various government
departments or ministries. They have separate offices.
A Legislative Assembly is a place where all the MLAs,
whether from the ruling party or from the opposition
meet to discuss various things. Hence, some MLAs
have dual responsibilities: one as an MLA and the
other as a minister. We will read about this further.

A debate in the Legislative Assembly
Afreen, Sujata and many other students from their
school travelled to the state capital to visit the
Legislative Assembly which was housed in an
impressive building. The children were excited. After
security checks, they were taken upstairs. There was
a gallery from where they could see the large hall
below. There were rows and rows of desks.
 This Assembly was going to have a debate on a
current problem. During this time, MLAs can express
their opinions and ask questions related to the issue
or give suggestions about what should be done by
the government. Those who wish to, can respond to
this. The minister then replies to the questions and
tries to assure the Assembly that adequate steps are
being taken.
 The chief minister and other ministers have to
take decisions and run the government. We usually
hear about them or see them in the news channels
or in the papers. However, whatever decisions are
being taken have to be approved by the members of
the legislative assembly. In a democracy, these
members can ask questions, debate an important
issue, decide where money should be spent, etc. They
have the main authority.
MLA 1: In my constituency of Akhandagaon,
during the last three weeks, there were 15 deaths
because of diarrhoea. I think it is a shame that this
government has not been able to check the situation
of a simple problem like diarrhoea while proclaiming
itself to be a champion of technology. I would call
the attention of the minister in charge of health to
take immediate measures to control the situation.
MLA 2: My question is why are government
hospitals in such a bad situation? Why is the
government not appointing proper doctors and other
medical staff in the district? I would also like to know
how the government plans to deal with this situation

which is affecting a large number of people and is
also spreading. This is an epidemic.
MLA 3: My constituency of Tolpatti too has a
serious shortage of water. Women travel up to 3 or 4
kilometres to collect water. How many tankers have
been put into service to supply water? How many
wells and ponds have been cleaned and disinfected?
MLA 4: I think my colleagues are exaggerating the
problem. The government has taken steps to control
the situation. Water tankers have been put into
service. ORS packets are being distributed. The
government is doing everything possible to help
people.
MLA 5: We have very poor facilities in our hospitals.
There are hospitals that do not have a doctor and no
medical staff has been appointed for the last few
years. In another hospital, the doctor has gone on a
long leave. This is a shame. I think the situation is
going from bad to worse. How are we going to
ensure that ORS packets reach all families in the
affected areas?
MLA 6: The opposition members are unnecessarily
blaming the government. The previous government
did not pay any attention to sanitation. We have now
taken up a drive to clear the garbage that has been
lying around for years.

In the working of the government,
explain the difference between
being an MLA and an MLA who is
also a minister.
In the earlier section you have read about a debate
in the Legislative Assembly. The members were
debating the action taken or not taken by the
government. This is because the MLAs are together
responsible for the work of the government. In
common usage the word ¶government· refers to
government departments and various ministers who
head them. The overall head is the chief minister.
More correctly, this is called the executive part of
the government. All the MLAs who gather together
(assemble) in the legislative assembly are called the
Legislature. They are the ones who authorise and
supervise their work. As we saw in the earlier section,
it is from among them that the head of the executive,
or the chief minister is formed.
Working of the government
The Legislative Assembly is not the only place where
opinions are expressed about the work of the
government and action is demanded. You will find
newspapers, TV channels and other organisations
regularly talking about the government. In a
democracy, there are various ways through which
people express their views and also take action. Let
us look at one such way.
Soon after the discussion in the assembly, there
was a press conference organised by the health
minister. Large numbers of people from different
newspapers were present. The minister and some
government officials were also present. The minister
explained the steps the government had taken.
Reporters asked many questions at this meeting.
These discussions were then reported in different
newspapers. The following page has one such report.
During the next week, the chief minister and the
minister for health visited Patalpuram district. They
went to visit the families who had lost their relatives
and also visited people in the hospitals. The
government announced a compensation for these

families. The chief minister also said that he thought
the problem was not only one of sanitation but also
of a lack of clean drinking water. He said that a high-
level enquiry committee will be asked to look into
the needs of the district to provide sanitation facilities
and would request the minister for Public Works to
take care of the needs of proper water supply in the
region.
As you saw above, the people in power like the
chief minister and the minister have to take action.
They do so through various departments like the
Public Works Department, the Agriculture
Department, the Health Department, the Education
Department and so on. They also have to answer
questions that are asked in the Legislative Assembly
and convince people asking the questions that proper
steps are being taken. At the same time, newspapers
and the media widely discuss the issue and the
government has to respond, for example, by holding
the press conferences.
During the last few weeks,
there have been many
deaths in some districts of
our state. There has been a
strong reaction that the
government has not taken
this seriously. The health
minister explained today at
a press conference that his
government has asked all
the collectors and the chief
medical officers to take
urgent measures. The most
important problem is that
of drinking water. The
minister said that they
intend to supply drinking
water to every village
through tanker trucks.
The chief minister has
promised funds for this
work. They also plan to
start a campaign to inform
people about the steps that
can be taken to prevent
diarrhoea. When a reporter
asked him as to what steps
are being taken to see that
garbage that has been lying
around for months is
quickly collected, the chief
minister said that he would
look into this.

Chapter 3: How the State Government Works
In a democracy, people organise meetings
to voice their opinions and protest
against the government.
 The government can also decide to make new laws
for the state regarding sanitation and health facilities.
For example, it may make it compulsory for
municipal corporations to ensure that there are
adequate toilets in every urban area. It may also
ensure that a health worker is appointed in every
village. This act of making laws on certain issues is
done in the Legislative Assembly of each state. The
various government departments then implement
these laws. Laws for the entire country are made in
the Parliament. You will read more about the
Parliament next year.
In a democracy, it is the people who elect their
representatives as Members of the Legislative
Assembly (MLAs) and, thus, it is the people who have
the main authority. The ruling party members then
form the government and some members are
appointed ministers. These ministers are in charge
of various departments of the government such as
health in the above example. Whatever work is done
by these departments has to be approved by the
members of the legislative assembly.

Gender
Teacher·s note
Gender is a term that you may often have
heard. It is a term, however, that is not
easily understood. It tends to remain
distant from our lives and restricted to
discussions during training programmes.
In fact, it is something that all of us
experience in our lives on a daily basis. It
determines, for example, who we are and
what we will become, where we can go and
where not, the life choices available to us
and those we eventually make. Our
understanding of gender is often based on
the family and society that we live in. This
leads us to think that the roles we see men
and women around us play are fixed and
natural. In fact, these roles differ across
communities around the world. By gender,
then, we mean the many social values and
stereotypes our cultures attach to the
biological distinction ¶male· and ¶female·. It
is a term that helps us to understand many
of the inequalities and power relations
between men and women in society.
The following two chapters explore the
concept of gender without actually using
the term. Instead, through different
pedagogic tools like case studies, stories,
classroom activities, data analysis and
photographs, students are encouraged to
question and think about their own lives
and the society around them. Gender is
often mistakenly thought to be something
that concerns women or girls alone. Thus,
care has been taken in these chapters to
draw boys into the discussion as well.
Chapter 4 uses two case studies, situated
in different places and points in time to
show how girls and boys are brought up
or socialised differently. This enables them
to understand that the process of
socialisation is not uniform; instead it is
socially determined and changes
continuously over time. The chapter also
addresses the fact that societies assign
different values to the roles men and
women play and the work they do, which
becomes a basis for inequality and
discrimination. Through a storyboard,
students discuss the issue of housework.
Done primarily by women, housework is
often not considered ¶work· and, therefore
made invisible and devalued.
 Chapter 5 further develops ideas around
gender inequalities in the world of work and
describes women·s struggles for equality.
Through a classroom activity, students
begin questioning existing stereotypes
regarding work and career choices. The
chapter also points out that opportunities
like education are not equally available to
boys and girls. By reading about the lives
of two Indian women, from the ninteenth
and twentieth centuries, students see how
women struggled to change their lives by
learning to read and write. Change on a
large scale usually takes place through
collective struggles. The chapter concludes
with a photo-essay that gives examples of
different strategies the women·s movement
has used to fight for change.

Prerna and her younger sister are watching a sports channel 
on television. Prerna enjoys running and she has been declared 
the fastest runner among the girls in her district for winning 
the 100 metre sprint at an interschool competition held at the 
district level. She is now training to compete at the state level. 
She dreams of representing India at the international level in 100 
metre sprint contests in future. 
While watching the rerun of sprints at the Olympic games held 
in the past, Prerna is always amazed that the measurement of 
the time taken for the race is so advanced that they could identify 
the winner even when two sprinters seemed to cross the ﬁ nish 
line almost together. However, in her school, the sports teacher 
only used a special kind of watch called a ‘stopwatch’ for timing 
the school races. She had noticed her mother wearing a watch on 
her wrist and her sister looking at her mobile phone when she 
needed to check the time. Her uncle used a Braille watch and had 
recently acquired a talking watch that announced the time at the 
touch of a button. There was also a large clock on the wall near 
the school entrance. Her thoughts turned to people in the ancient 
past, who did not have the modern gadgets we have today and 
she wondered…

8.1 Measurement of Time
Humans got interested in keeping track of time long ago. They 
started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves 
after deﬁ nite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting 
of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. 
They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. 
First, they devised calendars. A day was deﬁ ned by the cycle of 
rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to ﬁ nd ways 
of knowing the time of day. 
How 
was 
time 
measured when there 
were no clocks and 
watches?
So, they made many devices which 
helped them to measure smaller intervals 
of time within a day. Some of these were 
sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and 
candle clocks. 
In a sundial, time is determined with 
the changing position of the shadow of an 
object cast by the light of the Sun during 
the day (Fig. 8.1).
The water clocks used the ﬂ ow of water 
out or into a vessel to measure time. In 
one type, water ﬂ owed out from a vessel 
which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a). In 
the other type, there would be a bowl, with 
a ﬁ ne hole at the bottom, which was 
ﬂ oated on the surface of water (Fig. 8.2b). 
It gradually ﬁ lled up in a ﬁ xed time and 
ﬁ nally sank. Then, it was lifted up and 
ﬂ oated again. 
In an hourglass (Fig. 8.3), time was 
measured on the basis of the ﬂ ow of sand 
from one bulb to another.
Candle clocks (Fig. 8.4) were candles 
with markings that indicated the passage 
of time when burned.

Place the upper part of the bottle in an inverted position over

Fill the upper part of the bottle with water. You may add a 
few drops of ink or colour to make the water level easily 
visible (Fig. 8.5d). 
The water will start dripping into the lower part of the bottle. 
Using a watch, mark the level of water after every one minute 
till all the water drips down.
Your water clock is ready. Can you now guess how to use it? 
Pour the water from the lower part back into the top part and 
watch the level of water dripping into the lower part. Every time 
it touches a mark made by you, one more minute has passed.

The world’s largest stone sundial, 
the Samrat Yantra, was built 
around 300 years ago at the Jantar 
Mantar, 
in 
Jaipur, 
Rajasthan, 
a UNESCO World Heritage site 
that houses several astronomical 
instruments. With its imposing 
height of 27 metres, its shadow 
moves at about 1 millimetre per 
second and falls on a scale ﬁ nely marked to measure time intervals as 
short as 2 seconds. Like any sundial, it measures local or ‘solar time’, 
requiring a correction to determine Indian Standard Time.

FASCINATING FACTS
In ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water 
clocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement 
appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised 
between the second century BCE – third century CE). An accurate 
expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was 
given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water 
ﬂ owing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, 
and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very 
accurate because as water levels dropped, the ﬂ ow rate decreased. 
This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock 
(Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, ﬁ rst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then 
in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly 
with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town 
squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, 
conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was 
progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth 
century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals.

As human civilisation advanced, and 
as people began to travel long distances, 
the measurement of time became very 
critical. This led to the development of 
increasingly better mechanical devices 
for the measurement of time, driven 
by weights, gears, and springs from the 
fourteenth century onwards. However, 
the invention of the pendulum clock 
in the seventeenth century marked 
a major breakthrough in mechanical 
timekeeping.
KNOW A SCIENTIST
The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by 
Christiaan Huygens (1629 –1695). He was inspired by the investigations 
of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642). It is said that once while 
sitting in a church, Galileo’s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended 
from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse 
to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for 
each swing. After experimenting with diﬀ erent pendulums, Galileo 
concluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always 
the same for a pendulum of a given length.

A

consists 
of 
a 
small 
metallic ball (called the 
bob of the pendulum) 
suspended from a rigid

as shown in Fig. 8.7a.

Bob 
The pendulum at rest is in its mean position. When the bob of 
the pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts 
oscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it 
repeats its path after a ﬁ xed interval of time. 
The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when 
its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme 
position A, changes direction and moves to another extreme 
position B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The 
pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves 
from one extreme position A to another extreme position B and 
comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete 
one oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a 
pendulum and measure its time period.
Activity 8.2: Let us experiment
Collect a piece of string around 150 cm long, a heavy metal 
ball with hook/ a stone (bob), a stopwatch/ watch, and a ruler.
Tie the bob at one end of the string. 
Fix the other end of the string to a rigid support such that the 
length of the string in between support and bob is around 
100 cm. 
Wait for the bob to come to rest. Your pendulum is now 
ready.
We did an activity in the chapter 
‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ 
in the Grade 6 Science textbook 
Curiosity, where we observed the 
oscillatory motion of an eraser hung 
with a thread. Is the pendulum 
similar to that?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Gently hold the bob, move it slightly to one side and release 
it. Take care not to push the bob while releasing it and that 
the string is taut. Is your pendulum now oscillating?
Using a watch, measure the time it takes for the pendulum 
to complete 10 oscillations. Record the time in Table 8.1.
Repeat this activity 3–4 times.
Divide the time taken for 10 oscillations by 10 to calculate
the time period of your pendulum. Note it down in Table 8.1.

Is the time period of your pendulum almost the same every 
time? What do you conclude from this observation? The time 
period of the pendulum is almost the same every time.
THINK LIKE A SCIENTIST!
You just did an important historical experiment which was ﬁ rst done 
by Galileo, except you used a watch to measure time in place of your 
pulse beat. Suppose you were Galileo experimenting with pendulums, 
what all would you investigate? What questions could you ask? Would 
all pendulums have the same time period? How would you test this? 
Repeat Activity 8.2 using the same bob but with pendulums of two 
or three diﬀ erent lengths. Does the time period change? If so, how does 
the length aﬀ ect it? If changing the length inﬂ uences the time period, 
does the bob’s mass also matter? Test this by repeating Activity 8.2 
with a ﬁ xed pendulum length but with bobs of diﬀ erent mass. Do you 
observe any change?
The time period of a simple pendulum depends on its length but 
not on the bob’s mass. All pendulums of the same length have the same 
time period at a given location.

All clocks, old or modern, are based on some process repeating 
continuously, which can be used to mark equal intervals of time. 
Modern clocks measure time using the same basic principle — 
periodically repeating processes — but use tiny and very rapid 
vibrations either from a quartz crystal (quartz clocks) or from some 
speciﬁ c atoms (atomic clocks). While Huygens’ early pendulum 
clocks could gain or lose 10 seconds each day, today’s atomic clocks 
are so precise that they lose only one second in millions of years! 
Scientists are constantly searching for even better ways to measure 
time with greater accuracy.

8.1.2 SI unit of time
The SI unit of time is the second. Its symbol is s. The larger units 
of time are minute (min) and hour (h).
60 s = 1 min
60 min = 1 h
Units of time, such as second, minute, and hour begin with a 
lowercase letter, except at the beginning of a sentence. Their 
symbols ‘s’, ‘min’, and ‘h’ are also written in lowercase letters 
and in singular. Note that a full stop is not written after the 
symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the time, 
always leave a space between the number and the unit. Also, 
note that writing ‘sec’ for second and ‘hrs’ for hour is incorrect.

The hole in the bowl of Ghatika-yantra was made in such a manner 
that it took 24 minutes to ﬁ ll and sink. The time unit measured by this 
clock was called ghatika or ghati. It became the standard unit of time 
measurement and continued until the end of the nineteenth century. 
A 24-hour-long day was, thus, divided into 60 equal ghatis.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
In today’s world, measuring tiny fractions of a second is very 
important! For example, in sports, timekeeping devices can 
record events down to one-hundredth or even one-thousandth of 
a second (a millisecond) to determine the winners in a race. In 
medicine, heart monitors like Electrocardiogram (ECG) machines 
measure the millisecond variations in heartbeats to detect health 
issues. In music, digital recordings capture sound thousands of 
times per second for smooth playback. Many devices use even 
shorter intervals, smartphones, and computers process signals 
in microseconds (one-millionth of a second), allowing them 
to operate very fast. Scientists continue to develop even more 
precise time-measuring tools for space exploration, medicine, and 
advanced science experiments. The faster and more accurate our 
clocks become, the more they help society in ways we may not 
even notice!

For races covering the same 
distance, we can tell who was 
faster by measuring time. But how 
can we tell that when comparing 
races for diﬀ erent distances?
8.2 Slow or Fast
What do we mean when we say something is moving fast or 
slow? Suppose you are watching a 100 metre race on a straight 
track. All the players begin from the starting line together but 
after sometime they are not running together (Fig. 8.10). How do 
you decide who is running faster amongst them?

Activity 8.3: Let us identify
Look at the wall clock shown in Fig. 8.9 carefully. 
What is the smallest interval of time you can 
measure with it? 
One second is the smallest interval of time that we can 
measure using this clock.

Fig. 8.10: Boys running a race on a straight track
Someone who is ahead of others at some instant of time, is 
running faster than them. Hence, someone who has covered 
more distance within the same time is running faster.
The distances moved by objects in a given interval of time 
decide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster 
runner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the 
word ‘speed’. 
8.3 Speed
p
By comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a 
unit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The 
unit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call 
the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of 
the object.
How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be 
calculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object 
and the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total 
distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus,
Speed = Total distance covered
 
Total time taken
What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of 
length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of 
speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. 
Speed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the 
distance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is 
kilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.

8.3.1 Relationship between speed, distance, 
and time
We already know how to calculate speed using 
Speed = Total distance covered
 
Total time taken
if the distance travelled and time taken for it are known to us.
We can write this equation in a diﬀ erent form to calculate the 
distance covered by an object, if we know its speed and the time 
taken, by using 
Total distance covered = Speed × Total time taken
Similarly, we can also calculate the time an object will take to 
cover a distance, if the distance and speed are given, by using
Total time taken = Total distance covered
 
       
 
      Speed
Example 8.2: Raghav is going to a neighbouring city in a bus 
moving at a speed of 50 km/h. If it takes him 2 h to reach that 
city, how far is that city?
Solution: Distance covered by bus = Speed × Time
                                                               = 50 km
h ×2h
                                                              = 100 km
Example 8.3: A train is travelling at a speed of 90 km/h. How 
much time will it take to cover a distance of 360 km? 
Solution: Time taken by the train = Distance covered
Speed
                                                             =

                                                             = 4 h
In all the examples so far, we have found the speed of an 
object by using ‘the total distance covered divided by the total 
time taken’. However, the object might not have travelled with 
the same speed during the entire duration of time. The object 
might have sometimes moved slower or sometimes faster. So, the 
speed that we have calculated is the average speed, but, in this 
book, we have used the term ‘speed’ for ‘average speed’.

I once watched a part of marathon on a straight 
road stretch. I noticed that some people seemed to 
be running at the same speed during that distance

8.4 Uniform and Non-uniform Linear Motion
Do you remember learning about linear motion in the chapter 
‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity? When an object moves along a straight line, 
its motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a 
track which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway 
stations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is 
an example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the 
ﬁ rst station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then 
slows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between 
the two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a 
constant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed.

An object moving along a straight line with a constant speed 
is said to be in uniform linear motion. So, the train is in uniform 
motion between B and C (Fig. 8.11). On the other hand, if the speed 
of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said 
to be in non-uniform linear motion. The motion of the train 
between A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform 
(Fig. 8.11).
An object in uniform linear motion covers equal distances 
in equal intervals of time, while it covers unequal distances in 
equal intervals of times when it is in non-uniform linear motion. 
In Table 8.3, data are given for the distances travelled by two 
trains, X and Y, between the time 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

Which of the two trains is in uniform linear motion between 
10:00 AM and 11:00 AM? Train X covers equal distances in equal 
intervals of time, so it is in uniform linear motion while Train Y 
is in non-uniform linear motion.
Uniform linear motion is an idealisation. In everyday life, 
we seldom ﬁ nd objects moving with a constant speed over long 
distances or for long intervals of time. That is why we have to use 
average speeds.

and in the next 500 m, it moves with a speed of 5 m/s. With 
what speed should it move the remaining distance so that 
the journey is complete in 200 s? What is the average speed 
of the vehicle for the entire journey?

FASCINATING FACTS
Time started when our Universe was created and will 
continue in the future. We cannot see or feel time but we 
can only measure its passage in terms of a time interval 
between events. These time intervals can be fractions of 
a second, or even days or months, or years or centuries. 
We can only say when an event occurred or for how 
long it lasted. Though we have learnt to measure time 
with increasing accuracy, and our lives are governed 
by watches and clocks, ‘What is time?’ continues to be a 
tricky question with no easy answer!

Nihal and his classmates were excited for their school trip to the 
Bhakra Nangal Dam. There they would visit the hydroelectric 
power house where the force of falling water was used to generate 
electricity. They also looked forward to the free 13 kilometre- 
train ride from Nangal in Punjab to Bhakra in Himachal Pradesh, 
along the beautiful Sutlej river and through the Shivalik hills.
Prior to the trip, Nihal and his classmates were given a group 
assignment to prepare a presentation on the uses of electricity. 
They began by looking around their houses, then their school, 
followed by their neighbourhood, their city, and ﬁ nally they 
searched the internet. To their astonishment, their list kept 
growing. They decided to organise the uses under diﬀ erent 
headings.

Can you help Nihal by adding some more uses to his lists? 
Also, suggest some other ways of grouping the uses of electricity.
We use electricity all the time, so let us learn something more 
about electricity. You have learnt earlier that electricity is 
generated in multiple ways — by windmills, by using wind 
energy, by solar panels capturing the Sun’s energy, by falling 
water and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter ‘Nature’s 
Treasures’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric 
supply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via 
wires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the 
electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity, 
we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us 
may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like 
a torchlight.
Caution — The danger signs on electric poles and 
other appliances warn people that electricity can 
be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever 
perform experiments with power supply at your 
home or school. Even electricity from portable 
generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or 
cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or 
remotes, for experiments with electricity.
3.1 A Torchlight
g
You might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a ﬂ ashlight.
Activity 3.1: Let us explore
Take a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1.
Observe it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch?
Slide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow?
Now slide the switch back to its original position and observe 
the torch lamp.
You might have noticed that in the ﬁ rst position of the switch, 
the torch lamp glows and in the other position the lamp does not 
glow.
Now, open the torchlight. What do you ﬁ nd inside?
Inside the torchlight, you may ﬁ nd two or more electric cells. 
Why does the torch lamp 
glow in one position of 
its switch?

3.2 A Simple Electrical Circuit
p
To understand how a torch works, let us ﬁ rst ﬁ nd out about its 
components.
3.2.1 Electric cell
Activity 3.2: Let us observe
Take an electric cell, turn it around and look at 
it carefully (Fig. 3.2). Do you notice a positive 
(+) sign and a negative (–) sign marked on the 
electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a 
small protruding metal cap on one side and a 
ﬂ at metal disc on the other side?
All electric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) 
while the other is negative (– ve). The metal cap is the positive
terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative
terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.
3.2.2 Battery
Activity 3.3: Let us experiment
Take a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment 
and take out the cells.
Put the cells back in a diﬀ erent order. Also, try reversing 
the direction of one cell. Then, slide the switch and check 
whether the lamp glows in each case. 
Check the order in which the cells were placed in the torch 
when the lamp glows. 
The lamp glows when the cells are placed in the order as 
shown in Fig. 3.3. Notice how the terminals of the two cells are 
connected. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the 
negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or 
more cells is called a battery.

(b)
For many devices, we may need more than one cell. So, 
we connect two or more cells together as shown in Fig. 3.3. 
Connecting more than one cell provides energy to the circuit for 
a longer time and/or more energy. 
FASCINATING FACTS
The term battery is also used for a single cell. We use the term battery 
even for the single cell that powers our mobile phones.

For this activity, you will require a torchlight with an 
incandescent lamp (or light bulb). Many old torchlights 
still use such lamps. With your teacher’s help, conﬁ rm 
that your torchlight uses an incandescent lamp.
Take the torch and examine its lamp. What do you 
see? Do you notice a thin wire ﬁ xed in the middle 
of the glass bulb? 
Now, switch on the torch. Which part of the lamp 
glows? 
The thin wire inside the glass bulb of the lamp glows. 
The glowing thin wire is called the ﬁ lament of the lamp. 
Take out the lamp with the help of your teacher and 
inspect it from all sides. How is the ﬁ lament ﬁ xed?
The ﬁ lament is attached to two thicker wires that 
support it, as shown in Fig. 3.4a. One thick wire connects 
to the metal case at the lamp’s base, while the other 
connects to the metal tip at the centre of the base (Fig. 
3.4b). These form the two terminals of the lamp, and 
are ﬁ xed in a way that they do not touch each other. 
In such incandescent lamps, the ﬁ lament gets hot and 
glows to produce light.

LED Lamp
Many torches in use today have a Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp, 
instead of an incandescent lamp, as shown in Fig. 3.5.

Activity 3.5: Let us observe
Take an LED of any colour (Fig. 3.6) and 
observe. Do you see any ﬁ lament inside it?
Notice the length of two wires attached to 
the LED. Do you ﬁ nd one of those longer 
than the other?
Unlike incandescent lamps, LEDs do not 
have ﬁ laments (Fig. 3.6). They also have two 
terminals, but one is positive (attached to a 
longer wire) and the other is negative (the 
shorter wire). A torch may use one or more 
LEDs, sometimes of diﬀ erent shapes, in its 
lamp.
After having learnt about the electric cell, battery, and electric 
lamps, we are now ready to make the torch lamp glow using an 
electric cell or battery.
3.2.4 Making an electric lamp glow using an 
electric cell or battery
Activity 3.6: Let us construct
Take an electric cell, an incandescent lamp used in a torch, a 
cell holder, a lamp holder, and four lengths of electric wire.
Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of 
each wire to expose the metal.
Attach two wires to the two ends of the cell holder as shown 
in Fig. 3.7a.

Insert the cell in the holder such that its negative terminal 
is towards the spring side of the holder (Fig. 3.7b). In case a 
cell holder is not available, ﬁ x the two wires to the cell using 
electrical tape (Fig. 3.7c).
Attach two wires to the screws of the lamp holder as shown 
in Fig. 3.8a. Fix the lamp in the holder by turning it around in 
the holder (Fig. 3.8b). In case a lamp holder is not available, 
use electrical tape to attach two wires to the two ends of the 
lamp (Fig. 3.8c).

Now, we are ready to connect the cell to the lamp to make it glow.
We will conduct this activity in two parts — prediction and 
observation. Some of the ways in which the lamp and the cell 
can be connected are shown in Table 3.1. 

Predict, for each arrangement, if the lamp will glow or 
not and write your prediction in Table 3.1.

Now, connect the lamp and the cell, and observe if the 
lamp glows or not. Note down your observation in Table 
3.1. Also, for the lamps which glow, colour their glass 
bulbs yellow.

The lamp glows in the arrangements at S.No. 1 and 6 and does 
not glow in the remaining arrangements. Now, carefully look at 
the arrangements in which the lamp glows. Compare these with 
those in which the lamp does not glow. Can you ﬁ nd the reason 
for the diﬀ erence?
3.2.5 An electrical circuit
The lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to 
one terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the 
lamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This 
setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a 
complete path for electric current to ﬂ ow through 
the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes 
through the circuit.
The direction of electric current in an electrical 
circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative 
terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of 
the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell 
by wires, the current passes through the ﬁ lament 
of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With 
an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of 
its terminals connects to the positive or negative 
terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as 
the circuit is complete and current ﬂ ows through 
the ﬁ lament.
FASCINATING FACTS
Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when 
connected to a cell. We say the lamp has ‘fused’ usually due to 
a broken ﬁ lament. A broken ﬁ lament stops the ﬂ ow of current, 
preventing the lamp from glowing.
Let us now try to make an LED glow.
Activity 3.7: Let us experiment
Take two electric cells, an LED of any colour, a cell holder 
that can ﬁ t two cells (Fig. 3.8a), and two lengths of electric 
wire.
Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of 
each wire to expose the metal.
Connect the two wires to the cell holder as shown in 
Fig. 3.10a. 
Fig. 3.9: An electrical circuit
Electricity: Circuits and their Components
31
Insert two cells in the holder, taking care 
that for each cell, its negative terminal 
is towards the spring side of the holder 
(Fig. 3.10b) and the battery is ready to use. 
How will you decide which is the positive 
terminal of this battery?
The terminal of the holder which is connected 
to the positive terminal of one cell is positive 
and the one connected to the negative terminal 
of the other cell is the negative terminal.
Now, connect the free end of the battery 
positive terminal wire to the longer wire of 
LED, and the free end of the second wire to 
the shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c). Does the 
LED glow?
Repeat the above step but interchange the 
wires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d). 
Does the LED glow again?
You would have observed that the LED glows 
in the ﬁ rst case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in 
the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current 
can pass through the LED in one direction only. 
The current passes through the LED only when 
the positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is 
connected to the positive terminal of the battery, 
and negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED 
is connected to the negative terminal of the 
battery. When current passes through the LED, 
it glows. Always take care to connect an LED 
correctly in a circuit to make it glow.

Sometimes you may come across a device in which the cells are placed 
side by side. Then, how are the terminals of the cells connected?
If you carefully look inside 
the battery compartment, you 
will usually see a thick wire 
or metal strip connecting the 
positive terminal of one cell 
to the negative terminal of 
the next. To help with proper 
placement, ‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols 
are typically printed inside.

Activity 3.8: Let us construct
Collect two drawing pins, a safety pin (or a 
paper clip), two wires, and a small piece of 
cardboard.
Insert a drawing pin through the ring of the 
safety pin and ﬁ x it to the cardboard piece, 
ensuring that the safety pin can rotate freely 
(Fig. 3.11a).
Fix the second drawing pin to the cardboard 
piece so the free end of the safety pin can 
touch it (Fig. 3.11b).
Connect a wire to each drawing pin — our 
switch is ready!
Let us now test our switch.
Activity 3.9: Let us test
Connect the electric cell, lamp, and switch 
as shown in Fig. 3.8a. Does the lamp glow?
Rotate the free end of the safety pin till it 
touches the other drawing pin as shown in 
Fig. 3.8b. Does the lamp glow now?
When the safety pin touches both drawing 
pins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and 
allows the current to ﬂ ow. We call this the ON
position (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed 
and current ﬂ ows from the cell’s positive to 
negative terminal making the lamp glow. When 
the safety pin does not touch the second drawing 
pin, the gap in the circuit prevents current ﬂ ow, 
and the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position 
(Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open.
Note that a switch can be placed anywhere in 
a circuit. A switch is a simple device that either 
completes or breaks a circuit. The switches used 
for lights and other devices at home work the 
same way, though they are designed diﬀ erently.

Suppose, we make wires of materials other than 
metal and use them for making the electrical 
circuit. Do you think the electric current will 
pass through those materials in such a circuit?
Activity 3.11: Let us identify
Connect an electric cell and a lamp while 
leaving the two ends of wires free as shown 
in Fig. 3.15a. 
Touch the two free ends of the wires 
momentarily. Does the lamp glow? If yes, 
our tester is ready. We can use this tester 
to identify the materials through which 
electric current passes.
Collect objects of diﬀ erent materials, such 
as metal spoons, coins, cork, rubber, glass, 
keys, pins, plastic scale, wooden block, 
aluminium foil, candle, sewing needle, 
cardboard, paper, and pencil lead.
One by one, touch the free ends of the tester’s 
wires to both ends of each object you have 
collected (Fig. 3.15b). Make sure the wires don’t touch each 
other. Does the lamp glow every time?
Record your observations in Table 3.3.

Analyse your observations. Did the lamp glow for all 
materials?
The lamp glows for some materials only. This means that 
electric current can pass easily through some materials but not 
through others. The materials through which electric current 
can ﬂ ow easily are called good conductors, or conductors of 
electricity. The materials through which current cannot pass 
through are called insulators, or poor conductors of electricity. 
Based on the observations you have recorded in Table 3.3, 
conclude which materials are conductors of electricity and 
which are insulators. Note it in Table 3.3.
From your conclusions in Table 3.3, you would have realised 
that metals are conductors of electricity, and thus, are used for 
making wires. 
Silver, copper, and gold are the best electrical conductors. 
However, for making electrical wires, mainly copper is used 
due to its comparatively lower cost and abundant supply. 
Diﬀ erent types of electrical wires are used for diﬀ erent uses.
mak
DIVE
EEPER
From Table 3.3, you would have also realised that plastic, 
rubber, and ceramics are electrical insulators. Have you now 
understood why wires are covered with those materials?
Conductors and insulators are both important. Electrical 
wires, switches, connectors of plugs, and sockets are made of 
conductors. Insulators like rubber, plastics, and ceramics are 
used to cover wires, plug tops, and switches to protect people 
from electric shocks.
Caution — Our body is a conductor of electricity. Electric current 
passing through our body may cause severe injury or even death.
Always handle electrical appliances with care. Never touch switches or 
plugs with wet hands, or use electrical devices in wet areas, or handle 
equipment with damaged insulation or broken plugs.
Have you ever wondered how the electricity from a cell or 
battery is diﬀ erent from the electricity coming from a wall 
socket? Electricity from batteries usually powers small 
devices and is of a type called Direct Current (DC). In contrast, 
the electricity from power plants that come to the wall socket 
is known as Alternating Current (AC) and can run larger 
appliances.

In a Nutshell
An electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.
An electric cell has two terminals; one is called positive (+ve) 
while the other is negative (–ve).
In an incandescent electric lamp, there is a thin wire called 
the ﬁ lament, which gets hot and glows to produce light when 
electric current passes through it.
An LED has two terminals, one is positive (attached to a 
longer wire) and the other is negative (the shorter wire).
Electric current can pass through LED in one direction only.
An LED lights up only when its positive terminal (longer 
wire) connects to the positive terminal of the battery and 
its negative terminal (shorter wire) connects to the negative 
terminal of the battery.
A switch is a simple device that either completes or breaks a 
circuit.
The direction of electric current in a closed electrical circuit 
is taken to be from the positive to the negative terminal of 
the electric cell. 
A representation of an electrical circuit using symbols is 
called its circuit diagram.
Materials through which electric current can ﬂ ow easily are 
called good conductors or conductors of electricity.
Materials through which current cannot pass through are 
called insulators or poor conductors of electricity.

Yashwant and Anandi live in a village in Rajasthan. Their school 
has assigned them a project to learn about craftspersons who 
work with metals. They decide to visit the local ironsmiths who 
practise this craft. Yashwant and Anandi request their grandfather 
to accompany them (Fig. 4.1). They are curious to learn how these 
ironsmiths make diﬀ erent items of daily use. They interact with 
an elderly craftsperson, Sudarshan uncle. 
Yashwant: Which items do you generally make?
Sudarshan: Generally, we make items of daily use, such as ﬂ at 
pans (tawas), buckets (baltis), tongs (chimtas), and farming tools 
like spades (phawras), axes (kulhadis), trowels (khurpis), and 
rakes (jelees). 
Anandi: What materials are they made of?

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
42
Sudarshan: We use iron metal to make these items. We also use 
wood to prepare handles wherever required. Additionally, we 
use coal in our furnaces to heat the iron.
Sudarshan is heating an iron block in the furnace. It has become 
red hot. He starts beating it hard with a hammer.
Anandi is amazed and asks, “Why are you beating it?” 
Sudarshan: I am beating it to shape it into an axe.
Anandi: Wow, a piece of iron can be beaten into a ﬂ at shape! Can 
we do this with other metals as well?
You may also have many such questions — let us explore what 
else we can do with metals.
4.1 Properties of Materials
4.1.1 Malleability
Activity 4.1: Let us explore
Caution— Conduct this activity under the supervision of your teacher 
or an adult.
Collect some waste pieces of copper and aluminium, an iron 
nail, a piece of coal, a pea-sized lump of sulfur (gandhak), 
and a block of wood.
Recall the chapter ‘Materials Around Us’ in the Grade 6 
Science textbook Curiosity and observe the appearances of 
the above items. Are they lustrous? Also, note whether they 
are hard or soft and record  your observations in Table 4.1.
Fig. 4.2: Beating an iron nail with a hammer
Now, place each of these 
items one by one on any 
hard surface and beat them 
with a hammer (Fig. 4.2). 
What do you think will 
happen? 
Do 
the 
objects 
become slightly ﬂ attened or 
do they break into pieces? 
Record your observations in

Table 4.1: Appearance, hardness, and eﬀ ect of hammering on diﬀ erent 
objects or materials
Analyse Table 4.1. Identify the objects that are lustrous in 
appearance and hard. You might have observed that objects made 
from copper, aluminium, and iron are lustrous in appearance 
and are hard. Lustre shown by metals is known as metallic 
lustre. Materials like copper, aluminium, and iron are known as 
metals, whereas, coal, sulfur, and wood are non-lustrous and 
not as hard as metals. 
Are all metals hard and solid? Not really; some metals like 
sodium and potassium are so soft that they can be cut with a 
knife. There is one metal, mercury, that is found in a liquid state at 
room temperature, which you might have seen in thermometers. 
Recall the chapter ‘Temperature and its Measurement’ from the 
Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity. 
Which objects did you ﬁ nd become ﬂ at on beating with a 
hammer?
You must have observed that objects such as a piece of copper, 
an iron nail, and a piece of aluminium become ﬂ at when beaten; 
whereas other objects or materials behave diﬀ erently. This 
property by which materials can be beaten into thin sheets is 
called malleability. Most metals possess this property. Can you 
give some examples of metal sheets? You might have seen thin 
silver foil on some sweets and aluminium foil used for wrapping 
food items. These are formed due to their malleability. Gold and 
silver are the most malleable metals. 
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
44
A piece of coal or a lump of sulfur does not show this behaviour. 
They break into pieces and are said to be brittle. On the other 
hand, wood neither gets ﬂ attened into a sheet nor breaks into 
pieces. Therefore, wood is neither malleable nor brittle. 
HOLISTIC LENS
The impact of iron on the progress of civilisation of India
In the Grade 6 Social Science textbook Exploring Society India and 
Beyond, you learnt about the Harappans. They knew how to use 
metals like copper and gold. They used these metals to make various 
objects, from utensils to jewellery. However, you would hardly ﬁ nd 
any evidence of the Harappans using a very prominent metal iron, 
which you see a lot around you today. This is because it took a long 
time before iron was used in day-to-day activities.
 
However, once the use of iron gained prominence in the times that 
followed, it contributed signiﬁ cantly to the progress of civilisation in 
India. For instance, due to its strength, agricultural tools like ploughs 
made from iron were much superior to those used previously. 
 
What could be the potential reason that it is generally considered 
that copper was discovered earlier as compared to iron?

4.1.2 Ductility
Where do you ﬁ nd the use of metal wires? 
You might have seen wires of metals like copper or aluminium 
in electrical ﬁ ttings. Some ornaments, like bangles, necklaces, 
earrings, etc., are also made from metal wires. Metal wires play 
important functions in a variety of stringed musical instruments, 
such as veena, sitar, violin, and guitar.
This property of materials by which they can be drawn into 
wires is called ductility.
This property of ductility is mainly possessed by metals.
Gold 
is 
so 
ductile 
that one gram of it 
can be drawn into a 
2 kilometre-long wire! 
The 
ductile 
nature 
of 
metals enables for 
the creation of 
this tea strainer 
with metal wire.
The World of Metals and Non-metals
45
Have you ever seen wires made of coal or sulfur? Obviously 
not! We can say that coal and sulfur are not ductile.
Do you know that ropes made of steel [a mixture 
of metal (iron) and non-metal (carbon)] wires can 
support heavy loads? Therefore, they are used in 
suspension bridges and in cranes to lift heavy objects.

4.1.3 Sonority
Have you ever noticed the sound produced when a metal spoon, 
or a metal plate, or a metal coin is dropped on the ﬂ oor? How is it 
diﬀ erent from the sound produced when a piece of coal or wood 
is dropped on the ﬂ oor?  
Activity 4.2: Let us investigate
Caution— Be careful while dropping the 
objects.
Take a few objects, such as a metal 
spoon, a coin, a piece of coal, and 
a block of wood. 
Drop them one by one from a certain height.
Do you notice any diﬀ erence in the sound 
produced by these objects? 
I use the diﬀ erence in 
sound when my stick 
hits wood or metal to 
help ﬁ nd my way.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
46
You would observe that the metal spoon and the metal coin 
produce a ringing sound. Coal and wood, on the other hand, 
produce dull sounds. 
This property of metals that enables them to produce a ringing 
sound is called sonority, and metals are said to be sonorous in 
nature. 
Oh! The ringing sound 
of my ghungroos
is also due to the 
sonority of metals.
Now, I understand! 
The ringing sound 
of  the school bell is 
due to the sonority

4.1.4 Conduction of heat
Have you ever observed the vessels used for cooking in the 
kitchen? You might have noticed that the vessels used for heating 
are made of metals. Can you name some metals that are used for 
making cooking vessels? Do you know why these metals are used 
for this purpose?
Let us ﬁ nd out!
Activity 4.3: Let us investigate
Caution— This activity must be performed under the supervision of 
your teacher or an adult. Be careful while handling hot water.
Place a glass tumbler on a table. 
Fill it with hot water. 
Take a metal spoon and a wooden 
spoon of almost the same size and 
thickness.
Immerse 
both 
the 
spoons 
simultaneously into the hot water 
(Fig. 4.3) and leave them undisturbed 
for a few minutes.
Now, carefully touch the upper end 
of each spoon.
Wooden

The World of Metals and Non-metals
47
Some discussion points:
Which of the spoons get hotter?
What does this experiment tell us about heat transfer along 
the two spoons? 
You may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch 
than the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed 
in the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This 
shows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it 
hotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. 
In such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another 
of a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer 
heat are called conductors.
Based on the observations, one can say that metals are good 
conductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat. 
Now, we can understand why mostly metal vessels are used 
for cooking, and their handles are made with wood or other 
materials that do not conduct heat. You will learn more about 
this in the chapter ‘Heat Transfer in Nature’. 
4.1.5 Conduction of electricity
Have you ever seen an electrician using a screwdriver? What 
type of material is used for making its handle? You may have 
also noticed the electrician wearing rubber gloves and shoes 
while working. What can be the reason for this?
Activity 4.4: Let us design and create
Design an electric circuit, like the ‘tester’ circuit in the chapter 
‘Electricity: Circuits and their Components’. Repeat the same 
activity using the materials listed below and record your 
observations in Table 4.2.
You may collect a few objects, such as a piece of aluminium 
foil, an iron nail, a lump of sulfur (pea-sized), a copper wire, 
a piece of coal, a piece of dry wood, a stone, an eraser made 
of rubber and a piece of nylon rope.
Predict which of these could make the bulb of the tester 
glow and which could not.

You might have observed that objects made of aluminium, 
iron, and copper make the bulb glow, whereas sulfur, coal, 
wood, stone, eraser, and nylon rope could not make it glow. Do 
you see any pattern in the glowing of bulbs when using diﬀ erent 
materials in Activity 4.4? It is observed that all the materials that 
make the bulb glow are metals.
Materials that allow electricity to ﬂ ow through them easily 
are called good conductors of electricity. In contrast, materials 
that prevent the bulb from glowing by not allowing electricity to 
pass through them are called poor conductors of electricity. 
So, now we can understand that the plastic covering on 
screwdrivers and rubber gloves protect the electrician from 
electric shock because these materials are poor conductors of 
electricity.
We learnt that metals are generally hard, lustrous, malleable, 
ductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity. Now, let us 
learn how metals behave in the presence of air and water.
4.2 Eﬀ ect of Air and Water on Metals: Iron
You would have often noticed that iron objects develop brown 
deposits when left in the open for a few days. In which conditions 
would an iron object develop brown deposits? 
When it comes into contact with dry air only.
When it comes into contact with water only.
When it comes into contact with both air and water.
The World of Metals and Non-metals
49
Activity 4.5: Let us experiment
Caution— Be careful while handling iron nails.
Take a few shining iron nails. If you are using old iron 
nails, make sure to remove brown deposits from their 
surface by scrubbing them with the help of a small 
piece of sandpaper.
Take three clean, dry glass bottles or test tubes with 
tight-ﬁ tting caps or stoppers. Label them A, B, and C.
Take three iron nails and tie each iron nail with a thread. 
Place one iron nail and some silica gel in the glass bottle 
‘A’, and tighten the cap or stopper (Fig. 4.4a). Silica gel 
makes the air dry. It is the substance that is used in 
small pouches in some medicine bottles, water bottles, 
shoe boxes, etc., to keep them dry.
Place one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘B’. Pour freshly 
boiled and cooled water (to remove dissolved gases) 
into it until the iron nail is completely dipped in it. Now, 
pour some oil to form a layer over the surface of the 
water (Fig. 4.4b). The layer of oil on the surface of the 
water prevents the air from dissolving in the water. Cap 
the glass bottle tightly. 
Place one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘C’, and pour some 
water so that the iron nail is partially dipped. Keep this 
glass bottle unstoppered. This allows the iron nail to 
come into contact with both water and air, as shown in 
Fig. 4.4c.
Place all the glass bottles undisturbed at room 
temperature and observe the changes for 8 – 10 days.
Record your observations in Table 4.3.

What can you conclude from this experiment? 
It is observed in glass bottles A and B that the iron nails do not 
show any brown deposits. What does this observation indicate? 
This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron 
nails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone 
(bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the 
iron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that 
the presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits 
to develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of 
brown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is 
called rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of 
iron is called rusting. 
Many other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open 
in the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green 
coating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the 
surface of silver objects? Gradual deterioration of metal surfaces 
caused by air, water, or other substances is known as corrosion. 
Do you know that rusting of iron is a serious problem in our 
country? Every year, an enormous amount of money is spent to 
replace or repair iron structures damaged due to rusting. 
The rusting of iron can be prevented by several methods such 
as painting, oiling, greasing, and applying a protective layer of 
zinc metal on iron (galvanisation). We will learn about this in 
higher grades.

4.3 Eﬀ ect of Air and Water on Other 
Metals
Activity 4.6: Let us investigate (demonstration activity)
The teacher may demonstrate this activity.
Caution— It is advisable for students to wear protective eyeglasses 
and keep safe distance.
Take a magnesium ribbon about 
3 – 4 centimetres long. Clean 
it by rubbing with a piece of 
sandpaper.
Hold it with a pair of tongs. 
Ignite the other end using a 
spirit lamp or a candle (Fig. 4.5).
Let the magnesium ribbon burn.
What do you observe?
You must have observed that 
magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling white ﬂ ame and 
changes into a white powder. Collect it on a watch glass. This 
powder is magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction 
between magnesium and oxygen present in the air. 
Add a few drops of warm water to this white powder, stir it 
well, and check its nature. 
Recall the chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and 
Neutral’. Find out whether the solution of magnesium oxide 
is acidic or basic or neutral in nature. You can use any 
acid-base indicator.
What eﬀ ect does this solution have 
on blue and red litmus papers?
You would observe that it changes 
the colour of red litmus paper to blue 
(Fig. 4.6); hence, it is basic in nature. 
Generally, oxides of metals are basic in 
nature.
We will discuss this burning of 
magnesium 
ribbon

in 
the 
chapter ‘Changes Around Us: Physical 
and Chemical’.

Do you know that sodium is a metal which is stored in kerosene 
because it reacts vigorously with oxygen and water. A lot of heat 
is generated in the reaction. Storing sodium in kerosene prevents 
its exposure to moisture and air. Can you predict the nature of 
its oxide?
Let us now discuss some substances that do not behave like 
metals.

Gas jar
Sulfur
The teacher may demonstrate this activity. 
Caution— This activity must be performed in a fume hood 
or well-ventilated area. Burning sulfur produces gases, which 
can be harmful if inhaled. 
Take a small amount of powdered sulfur in a 
deﬂ agrating spoon (it is a long-handled metal 
spoon used in experiments to safely heat and burn 
substances Fig. 4.7a). If a deﬂ agrating spoon is not 
available, you may take a metallic cap of any bottle, 
wrap a metallic wire around it and give it the shape 
as shown in Fig. 4.7b.
Heat it on a ﬂ ame, and as soon as the sulfur starts 
burning, introduce the deﬂ agrating spoon into a 
gas jar or glass tumbler (Fig. 4.7c). Cover the gas jar 
or glass tumbler with a lid to ensure that the gas 
produced does not escape.
Remove the lid after 3 – 4 minutes and take out the 
deﬂ agrating spoon. Add a small quantity of water 
into the gas jar, quickly place the lid back and shake 
it so that the gas dissolves. 
Again, recall the chapter ‘Exploring Substances: 
Acidic, Basic, and Neutral’. Using an acid-base 
indicator, check whether the solution obtained 
after the addition of water to the gas jar is acidic or 
basic or neutral. 
What do you observe?
The World of Metals and Non-metals
53
You would observe that it is acidic in 
nature (Fig. 4.7d). 
On burning sulfur in air (oxygen), 
sulfur dioxide gas is formed. On dissolving 
sulfur dioxide gas in water, sulfurous acid 
is formed.
Does sulfur behave in water the same 
way metals do?
Activity 4.8: Let us explore
Take some sulfur powder in a glass tumbler. 
Add a small amount of water to it.
What do you observe?
You may have noticed that there is no reaction when sulfur is 
placed in water. 
Substances like sulfur and phosphorus behave diﬀ erently 
with air and water than metals. Phosphorus is stored in water 
as it catches ﬁ re when exposed to atmospheric air. These 
substances are usually soft and dull in appearance. They are 
neither malleable nor ductile, and they are not sonorous. They 
are also poor conductors of heat and electricity. These are called 
non-metals. Their oxides are acidic in nature. 
Some other non-metals are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, 
etc. These must not be confused with materials such as plastic, 
glass, wood, rubber, and paper. These materials are not classiﬁ ed 
as metals or non-metals because they are not elements. 
Metals and non-metals are sub-categories of 
substances called elements. An element is a substance 
that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. 
Presently 118 elements are known. These 
elements are the basic building blocks of all matter. 
Some are naturally occurring, while others are 
artiﬁ cially made in the laboratory, and do not exist 
in nature. You will study more about elements in 
higher grades.

and electrical conductivity, and high strength. However, this 
should not give an impression in your mind that non-metals are 
not important in our lives. 
We breathe in oxygen, which is a non-metal, and without it, 
we would not be able to survive. Can you think of any other uses 
of oxygen?
Carbon is essential in everyday life because it is the building 
block of all life forms. It is a key component of proteins, fats, and 
carbohydrates, which are necessary for growth and energy. 
Nitrogen is used in the manufacturing of fertilisers and other 
chemicals. It is an essential nutrient for the growth of plants. 
Chlorine is a non-metal commonly used in water puriﬁ cation. 
A solution of iodine, a non-metal, is applied on wounds as an 
antiseptic. 
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Do you know that many metals and their alloys (mixtures of two or 
more metals or a metal and a non-metal) are important for daily use as 
utensils and tools. These are also important for modern technologies 
and essential in almost every industry. Some special metals are also 
used in atomic energy (such as zirconium), aerospace (titanium), etc. 
In India, many metals, especially iron and aluminium, are recycled to 
minimise waste and contribute to sustainability. 
In a Nutshell
Metals and non-metals are diﬀ erentiated based on their 
properties.
Generally, metals are lustrous, whereas most non-metals are 
non-lustrous.
Metals are generally malleable and ductile, while non-metals 
do not have these properties.
Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, but 
non-metals are generally poor conductors.
Metals react with oxygen to produce metal oxides which are 
basic in nature.
Non-metals react with oxygen to produce oxides which are 
acidic in nature.
Generally, non-metals do not react with water.
Metal objects get damaged when exposed to moist air, and 
the process is known as corrosion.

These students are describing some changes. What kinds of 
changes are they talking about?

Activity 5.1: Let us think and reﬂ ect
You might have observed various changes happening around 
you. Some of them are listed in Table 5.1, you may notice that 
something is changing in each case. Take a moment to reﬂ ect on 
the changes in each case. Record your observations in Table 5.1.

You might have noticed that these changes could be in the size, 
shape, smell, or other property of the substance or object. Can you 
think of some other changes that happen in your surroundings? 
Make a list of those changes too.  
We observe the changes occurring around us with the help of 
our senses of sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste.
Can we arrange these 
changes into categories?
Let us try to answer this question.

Activity 5.2: Let us create and discuss
A. Creating some objects with paper 
Take a few sheets of paper 
and fold them to create 
new objects (Fig. 5.1).
Do you get the same paper 
back when you unfold 
these objects?
B. Playing with a balloon
Take a balloon and inﬂ ate 
it. Now, loosen your grip 
and let the air escape out.
Do you get the uninﬂ ated balloon back? 
Take another balloon; inﬂ ate it and grip the opening 
tightly. Now, prick it with a pin. 
Caution — Be careful while using a pin.
What happens? Will you be able to get the uninﬂ ated 
balloon back?
C. Crushing a piece of chalk
Crush a small piece of chalk into powder.
Can you get the chalk piece back from the powder?
Is there any similarity in the changes listed in A, B, and C?
During all these changes, materials, such as the paper, the 
rubber sheet of the balloon, and the chalk, remained the same, 
though their appearances (shape or size) may have changed. You 
may also recall from the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that 
water can exist in diﬀ erent states (solid, liquid, and gas), and can 
change from one state to another. 
In all these cases, although we observe a change in the 
appearance, no new substance is formed. Such changes in which 
only physical properties like shape, size, and state of substances 
change are called physical changes. 
Let us explore a diﬀ erent type of change.

Activity 5.3: Let us explore 
Take two glass tumblers or small transparent bottles. Mark 
them A and B. 
Fill one-fourth of glass tumbler A with tap water and 
one-fourth of glass tumbler B with lime water. 
Now, blow air (exhale) into each glass tumbler, one at a time, 
using separate straws (Fig. 5.2) and observe them. 
Caution — Do not suck the water or lime water while doing this.

Fig. 5.2: Blowing air in (a) tap water; (b) lime water
Do you notice any changes?  
In glass tumbler A, blowing air into water creates bubbles 
only, and there is no change in the appearance of the water. In 
glass tumbler B, blowing air into lime water creates bubbles, and 
turns the lime water milky (or cloudy). If we leave it for some 
time, a white substance settles at the bottom of the glass tumbler, 
indicating something new has formed. Such changes, in which 
one or more new substances are formed, are called chemical 
changes. New substances are formed through a process called 
chemical reaction. In this case, carbon dioxide from the air you 
breathe out (exhale) reacts with lime water, and forms a new 
white-coloured substance (calcium carbonate) that is insoluble 
in water. Therefore, the liquid in the bottle appears milky. Along 
with this a small amount of water is also formed. This formation 
of a new substance indicates a chemical change. The chemical 
reaction involved in this change can be represented in short 
form as a chemical equation. 
 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical
61
Calcium hydroxide + Carbon dioxide 
 Calcium carbonate + Water
       (Lime water) 
(Insoluble substance)
The turning of lime water milky is also used as a test for 
carbon dioxide. Let us explore this with another activity using 
some substances from our kitchen.
Activity 5.4: Let us experiment 
Take a teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon juice in a test tube.
Add a pinch of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) 
to it.
What do you observe?
You would hear a ﬁ zzing bubbling sound and see the gas 
bubbles forming.
Pass this gas through freshly prepared lime water kept in 
another test tube, as shown in Fig. 5.3a. 
What do you observe?
The lime water turns milky. What do you infer about the gas 
formed by mixing vinegar and baking soda?
This indicates that the gas formed is carbon dioxide.
This activity can also be performed using two small used 
bottles instead of test tubes and a ﬂ exible straw, as shown in 
Fig. 5.3b.

Since a new substance, carbon dioxide, is formed in this 
reaction, we say that a chemical change has occurred here as 
well. It can be represented as—
Vinegar + Baking soda 
 Carbon dioxide + Other substances
Repeat the above activity using baking soda and water. Do you 
observe any bubble formation? Is this a physical or a chemical 
change?

5.3 Some Other Processes Involving 
Chemical Changes
g
5.3.1 Rusting
In the rusting of iron, which you studied 
in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and 
Non-metals’, a new brown-coloured 
substance called rust is formed. Thus, 
rusting is also a chemical change because 
it involves the formation of a new 
substance, iron oxide (Fig. 5.4). 
5.3.2 Combustion
Let us recall the burning of a magnesium ribbon 
(Fig. 5.5) learnt in the chapter ‘The World of 
Metals and Non-metals’. Can you predict if this is 
a physical or a chemical change?
When the magnesium ribbon is burnt, a new 
substance, magnesium oxide, is formed. So, the 
burning of magnesium ribbon also involves a 
chemical change. We observed that heat and light 
are also produced along with the formation of a 
new substance in this reaction.
The burning of magnesium ribbon can be represented as—
Magnesium + Oxygen 
 Magnesium oxide + Heat + Light
 
   (Ribbon)          (Air)         (White powder)
A chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen 
and produces heat and/or light is called combustion. Substances 
that undergo combustion reactions are called combustible
substances. For example, wood, paper, cotton, kerosene, etc., 
are combustible substances.
Fig. 5.4: Rusted 
iron nails
Fig. 5.5: Burning magnesium ribbon 
Let us ﬁ nd out whether the presence of oxygen 
is essential for combustion. 
Activity 5.5: Let us investigate 
Place two identical candles on two separate 
petri dishes and light them.
Cover one of these with a glass tumbler, as 
shown in Fig. 5.6. 
What happens to the candle ﬂ ames in the two 
cases?     
Fig. 5.6: Candle (a) burning 
(b) covered with a glass tumbler
(a)
(b)
 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical
63
We observe that the candle that was not covered (Fig. 5.6a) 
continues to burn, whereas the candle that was covered with a 
glass tumbler (Fig. 5.6b) stops burning after some time. Why does 
this happen?
Since the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have 
a continuous supply of air, the ﬂ ame gets extinguished soon. 
The component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This 
can be conﬁ rmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass 
tumbler inverted on the candle. How can you test the presence 
of carbon dioxide gas? 
You can test the carbon dioxide gas by adding a small amount 
of lime water in the petri dish. You will notice that it turns milky. 
This carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and 
the oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for 
combustion.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
If a person’s clothes catch ﬁ re, what is the best way to extinguish 
the ﬁ re?
Wrap a blanket or cloth around the person. This cuts oﬀ  the 
supply of air, and the ﬁ re gets extinguished. 
Caution — Synthetic blanket or cloth should never be used to put 
out a ﬁ re, as these can melt and stick to the skin.
FASCINATING FACTS
Nature’s wonders: You might have 
seen some insects emitting light in 
a garden or a ﬁ eld in late evenings. 
These insects are called ﬁ reﬂ ies, and 
their light is produced by a chemical 
change. This type of light production 
(without heat) in living organisms is 
called bioluminescence.
Fireflies

Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion?
We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen 
are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a 
combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any 
length of time without it catching ﬁ re. What else is needed to 
start combustion?
Let us learn about this.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
64
Activity 5.6: Let us investigate   
Caution — Perform this activity under the supervision of your teacher 
or an adult.
Hold a piece of paper with a pair of 
tongs and bring a lighted matchstick 
to it. It quickly catches ﬁ re. Do we say 
that we need a ﬁ re to start the burning 
process? 
Take another piece of paper. Using a 
magnifying glass, focus the sunrays to 
make the smallest and brightest spot on 
the paper, as shown in the Fig. 5.7a. 
Hold it there for some time. 
What do you observe?
We observe that the paper starts to 
emit 
smoke, 
and 
then 
catches 
ﬁ re 
(Fig. 5.7b). Thus, we ﬁ nd that a substance 
can burn even without ﬁ re. How do we 
explain this change?
Focusing sunrays on the paper heats 
it. The temperature of the paper increases 
with time. After some time, the paper 
becomes so hot that it starts burning. 
This minimum temperature at which a 
substance catches ﬁ re is called its ignition 
temperature. Since the temperature of the 
lighted matchstick was already higher than 
the ignition temperature of the paper, it 
caught ﬁ re almost immediately.
Fig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a 
magnifying glass
Fig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire
So, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur, 
there are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) —
(i) A combustible substance, also called ‘fuel’
(ii) Oxygen
(iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature.
5.4 Can Physical and Chemical Changes 
Occur in the Same Process? 
What changes take place when a candle is lit? Let us explore!

Activity 5.7: Think, pair, and share
Look at the Fig. 5.9. Analyse what students are discussing about 
the burning candle. 
What do you think?
Fig. 5.9: What changes occur when a candle burns?
The wax melts and 
evaporates...
I think the wax burns, 
and new substances 
are formed… 
Maybe

Wax melts, ﬂ ows, 
and solidiﬁ es in

Maybe...
The wax of the candle melts, is carried up the wick, and 
evaporates due to the heat of the ﬂ ame. The vapour of wax burns 
to produce a ﬂ ame. The melting of wax, its solidiﬁ cation, and 
evaporation are physical changes. The burning of vapour on the 
other hand, is a chemical change. This shows that the burning of 
a candle involves both physical and chemical changes.
KNOW A SCIENTIST
The candle you just observed has long been an object of curiosity for 
several scientists including Michael Faraday, who made signiﬁ cant 
contributions to several areas of science. In the 
nineteenth century, Faraday delivered a series 
of lectures called Chemical History of a Candle. 
Faraday believed that the candle was the perfect 
object to introduce scientiﬁ c study. Through 
it, he discussed diﬀ erences between various 
physical and chemical processes like melting, 
vapourisation, and combustion.

5.5 Are Changes Permanent?
Once something has undergone a change, can we get it back in 
its original form?
g
Activity 5.8: Let us think
Think again about all the changes that we have discussed 
or talked about so far. In which of these can we get back the 
object or substance in the form we started with? Record your 
observations in Table 5.2.

Returning to the original object or substance with which we 
started shows that the changes we brought can be reversed. For 
example, when ice melts, it can be refrozen into ice. Similarly, 
when water evaporates, it can be condensed back into liquid 
water. However, some changes cannot be reversed since we 
cannot get the original object or substance back after the change. 
For example, chopped vegetables cannot return to their original 
size and shape, and making popcorn cannot go back to its original 
form. Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that 
can be reversed and those that cannot be reversed.
5.6 Are All Changes Desirable? 
g
Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the 
changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, 
and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you 
think of some other desirable changes happening around you?
 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical
67
On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such 
as the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. 
A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable 
in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be 
very useful in converting food waste into compost.
Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity 
can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the 
increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., 
is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many 
substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution.
5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes
g
5.7.1 Weathering of rocks
Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of 
mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How 
have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that 
break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due 
to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of 
water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break.
Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with 
the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An 
example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, 
an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains 
iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The 
red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock 
surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing 
water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are 
collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the 
formation of soil.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
68
5.7.2 Erosion 
Have you noticed ﬁ ne sand collecting on riverbeds or in lakes? 
This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are 
broken down and moved from one location to another by natural 
forces like wind and ﬂ owing water. This process is called erosion.
Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. 
River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the 
constant erosion caused by the ﬂ owing water. When the speed 
of the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the 
material transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. 
These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most 
of these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot 
be reversed.
In a Nutshell
A physical change is one in which a substance or object 
undergoes a change in its physical properties and no new 
substance is formed.
A chemical change is one in which one or more new 
substances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and 
can be represented by a chemical equation.
Combustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical 
changes.
Substances that undergo combustion are combustible 
substances. Heat and/or light are given out during 
combustion.
The lowest temperature at which a substance can catch ﬁ re 
is called its ignition temperature. 
Some changes can be reversed and some cannot.
Some changes are desirable and some are not.
Rocks undergo physical and chemical changes due to 
weathering to form soil.
Erosion caused by ﬂ owing water and wind is a physical 
change.

into a clay pot (physical change/chemical change). The fruits, 
vegetable peels, and other materials begin to decompose 
due to the action of bacteria and fungi, forming compost 
(physical change/chemical change). He decides to plant 
seeds in the compost and water them regularly. After a few

We hope you enjoyed your adventures with Curiosity in 
Grade 6, and are now ready to continue our journey into the 
wonderful world of science. This again, is not just a textbook with 
facts — it is an invitation to question, to perform experiments, 
and to explore, as we try to understand the beautiful world we 
live in. The world of science covers everything — small and large, 
near and far. We may be looking at tiny cells inside a leaf, or 
the movement of the sun and the stars. We may be testing out 
the materials around us at home, or discussing how water ﬂ ows 
underground. As you go through the chapters in this book, you 
will start new adventures that challenge your thinking, expand 
your knowledge, and help you become an explorer, making small 
discoveries for yourself. 
Before we dive into our exciting journey, take a moment to 
observe something special about this book. Look at the page 
numbers — they follow the playful ﬂ ight of a butterﬂ y and the 
soaring of a paper plane! Just as a butterﬂ y ﬂ utters freely and a 
paper plane ﬂ ies into the sky, learning takes ﬂ ight when curiosity 
leads the way. Did you know that something as simple as a paper 
plane inspired real scientiﬁ c explorations of ﬂ ight? From early 
inventors studying bird wings to modern engineers designing 
aircraft, the dream of ﬂ ying started with simple observations and 
experiments. So, as you turn each page, let your imagination take 
ﬂ ight — exploring new ideas, discovering wonders, and reaching 
for the skies!
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Exploration, of course, isn’t just about discovering new facts 
or learning about diﬀ erent things in nature. Science, as we said 
in Grade 6, is a process, so it is about a way of thinking that 
welcomes curiosity, asks questions, and is open to the unknown. 
In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things 
work? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can 
we learn from the patterns that we see in nature? 
To do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the 
classroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities 
and experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not 
just be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones 
to a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of 
our place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you 
to see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just 
about discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young 
science explorers, you will soon see how human activities are 
linked to what happens in the natural world and are connected 
to the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that 
science can play in addressing environmental challenges and 
help in creating a more sustainable world. 
But let’s get back into this book for now. You will read about 
topics in diﬀ erent ﬁ elds of science, from physics and chemistry 
to biology and earth sciences. While they might appear as 
diﬀ erent chapters, just as we had said in Grade 6, they are 
all interconnected. Scientiﬁ c ideas in one area often inspire 
discoveries in another, or at least allow us to ask questions in 
another area. So, let’s take a quick journey through our book for 
this year. We will start by looking at the properties of materials 
around us, mostly the things we experience but perhaps never 
ask questions about — why are some fruits sour? What happens 
when we wash a haldi stain on our school uniform? 
The Ever-Evolving World of Science
3
We then move on and play with some 
electric batteries, lamps and wires to try to 
ﬁ nd other kinds of properties of materials. 
What kind of materials do we need to make a 
lamp glow? This will lead us to classifying 
materials based on their properties — and we 
will enter the world of metals and non-metals. 
We know from our experience that a torch 
battery runs out eventually, and can’t be used 
again. We’ll explore what kind of changes happen around us. 
Some changes can be reversed and others cannot be reversed. 
Batteries run out, ice melts into water, fruits ripen, rocks break 
into pebbles… what kind of changes are these? Some of these 
happen, or happen faster, when things are heated. We will look 
at how heat ﬂ ows — whether it is the melting of an ice cube in a 
glass, or the melting of a glacier. Water is, of course, everywhere, 
and with the heat from the Sun, it evaporates from the seas and 
falls as rain, perhaps trickling down into the ground, somewhere 
far away.  
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

However, it isn’t just changes in materials 
around us that we see, or the hidden changes in 
water that we do not see. As we are growing, our 
bodies are changing as well. Especially around 
the middle-school years, our bodies are changing 
rapidly! Why? Not just us humans, there are 
life processes that are essential to all animals 
for their survival. To grow, we have to eat and 
breathe, blood has to circulate the nutrients 
from the food all over the body and so on. But 
why animals alone? Don’t plants also need food 
to grow? How do they get their food? Do they also 
breathe? How? Over the time that life has evolved 
on our planet Earth, it has ﬁ gured out how to do this in a beautiful 
and carefully balanced way. Ah, but what is time? The clock on 
the wall or a wrist watch tells us the time and how it passes. We 
get prepared to go to school in the morning and are ready to sleep 
at night but have you thought about how we measure time? And 
how fast does something happen? 
Long before the age of electric clocks and digital watches, early 
humans observed the shadows of objects in the Sun and used the 
position of the shadows to tell the time. Light and shadows are 
not just useful for shadow 
puppets or to tell the time. 
Naturally, light helps us see 
and today, we’ve developed 
a lot of ways to generate 
light (so we can read a 
book at night, even when 
the Sun doesn’t shine). But, 
more importantly, asking 
questions about the nature 
The Ever-Evolving World of Science
5
of light has given us a very deep understanding of the universe 
we live in. While we’ll perhaps learn about it only later, light and 
shadows are not just limited to things around us at home. 
Even the Earth and the Moon can cast shadows, leading to 
the fascinating phenomena of eclipses. And of course, we have 
day and night that depend on receiving light from the Sun. To 
understand all of this, we need to know how the Earth rotates 
around its axis, how the Moon goes around the Earth, and the 
Earth around the Sun. And the consequences of these movements 
on life on our beautiful planet. While all this might have your 
head spinning, think about it. Isn’t it amazing that we humans 
can wonder about the wonderful world we live in?
In the chapters that follow, you’ll 
also make simple observations and 
do fun experiments, and dive into 
topics that need careful thinking. 
Each chapter builds on what you 
already know and encourages you 
to ask questions, explore, do hands-
on experiments, and think like a 
scientist! As you will ﬁ nd out, even 
those experiments that seem to 
conﬁ rm what we think will happen, 
might 
lead 
to 
some 
additional 
questions that might need more 
experiments and more questions.

Activity 1.1: Question the Answer
In school or during tests, you’re usually given questions and 
expected to ﬁ nd the answers. But let’s turn that around! To think 
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

like a scientist, it is equally important to ask interesting questions! 
Great scientists don’t just answer questions — they ask amazing 
ones! (Remember last year we had said, “To be a wise person, 
you must be a whys person”.) 
Look at the answers below. Your task is to come up with a 
curious, creative, and fun question or situations that could 
lead to these answers. There are never any wrong questions, so 
let your imagination run wild! Since such exercises might not 
be very familiar, here is an example to help you! Suppose the 
answer was ‘just make it half!’ — what all could this be a response 
to? Well, it could range from “How do we ensure getting equal 
shares of cake?” to “My essay is too long”, or “I can’t ﬁ t this in 
the envelope” or even “I cannot dance to such a long song”... all 
very diﬀ erent! So, let’s see what kind of creative questions you 
can ask! 
(Please ask a more interesting, and not obvious questions 
like “What is 32+10?”, or even “What is the answer to life, the 
universe, and everything?”)

On 28 February, the school hosted a science fair to celebrate 
National Science Day. At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and 
Keerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were 
curious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them!
A few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid 
on these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets 
sprayed. To their surprise, the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful 
World of Science’ appeared on the papers the moment the liquid 
was sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how 
this happened and the reason behind it.
Their curiosity was partly satisﬁ ed at the ‘Colourful World 
of Substances’ stall. They saw many activities showing colour 
changes on mixing diﬀ erent substances. They decided to explore 
these changes further. Let us join them on this learning adventure.

2.1.1 Litmus as an indicator
Activity 2.1: Let us explore
Collect samples of lemon juice, soap solution, amla juice, 
tamarind water, vinegar, baking soda solution, lime water, 
tap water, washing powder solution, sugar solution, and salt 
solution.

Take a strip of blue litmus paper 
and cut it into small pieces.
Spread these pieces on a clean 
and dry white tile.
Using a dropper, put one drop of 
each of the samples, one-by-one, 
on these litmus paper pieces, as 
shown in Fig. 2.2a.
Do you observe any change 
in the colour of the blue 
litmus pieces?
Record your observations

observations in Table 2.1.
How to prepare lime water?
Do not confuse lime water with the word lime, which is a fruit 
similar to lemon.
Lime water (solution of calcium hydroxide in water) can be 
easily prepared by mixing lime (chuna, i.e. calcium oxide) in water 
and leaving it undisturbed for some time, say an hour. Filter the 
liquid into another container and use it as lime water.

Let us ﬁ nd out!
Litmus is a natural substance obtained from lichens. It is 
available  both as a solution and in the form of paper strips, 
known as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two 
colours—blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3. 
Substances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in 
nature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic
in nature. Since litmus shows diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic 
solutions, it is called an acid-base indicator.
Some other substances, both natural and synthetic, can 
also be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in 
laboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher 
grades.
HOLISTIC LENS
Lichens are formed by the association of two 
living organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow 
on rocks and trees in regions that have abundant 
rainfall and clean air. Do you ﬁ nd lichens on trees 
in your neighbourhood?
Lichens
Now, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B, 
and Group C in Table 2.2.
The substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice, 
tamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to 
red, implying that these substances are acidic in nature. 
The substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking 
soda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution 
turned the red litmus paper to blue. Hence, these substances 
are basic in nature. 
The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, 
and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus 
paper. Can you predict their nature?
These substances are said to be neutral because they are 
neither acidic nor basic.
I am curious to know — what are these 
red and blue litmus paper strips made of? 
Why do they change colour when drops 
of some samples are put on them?

Now, I can check 
the nature of ﬂ oor 
cleaning liquid using 
an indicator! 
Activity 2.2: Let us relate and explore
Are all the substances in Group A of Table 2.2 edible? Have you 
ever tasted these edible substances? Can you recall their taste? 
You will ﬁ nd that all these substances taste sour. Thus, we can 
say that substances that taste sour tend to contain acids and are 
acidic in nature.
Caution — Do not taste anything until asked to do so. Do not taste any 
unknown substance.
Some common edible substances and the names of the most 
common acids present in them are given in Fig. 2.4.

Find out and write the names of the most common acids 
present in the following substances —
Lemon________, Curd________, Tamarind________, Vinegar________.
Now, let us take one of the substances — baking soda 
solution — from Group B. Rub the baking soda solution between 
your ﬁ ngers. What do you observe? 
It feels soapy or slippery. Basic substances are generally 
slippery to touch.
Also, bases generally taste bitter, but 
everything that tastes bitter may not 
contain a base. For example, bitter gourd 
(karela) possesses a bitter taste but is not 
basic in nature.
If litmus is not available, are there 
some other natural substances 
that 
can 
serve 
as 
acid-base 
indicators?

2.1.2 Red rose as an indicator
You might have observed many coloured ﬂ owers in your 
surroundings. Try making your indicators using these ﬂ owers.
Activity 2.3: Let us prepare 
Collect some fallen petals of 
red roses available in your 
surroundings (Fig.  2.5). It is 
advised not to pluck ﬂ owers. You 
may pick petals or ﬂ owers fallen 
on the ground.
Take a ﬁ stful of the collected 
petals of red roses and wash 
them with water. 
Crush the petals using a mortar 
and pestle.
Place them in a glass tumbler.
Pour some hot water into the glass tumbler to ensure that 
the crushed ﬂ ower petals are completely immersed.
Caution — Perform this step under the supervision of an adult.
Cover the glass tumbler with a lid. Wait for 5 – 10 minutes till 
the water becomes coloured (Fig. 2.6), and ﬁ lter it.
The ﬁ ltrate (liquid after ﬁ ltration) is the required ﬂ ower 
extract (Fig. 2.7) to be used as an acid-base indicator.

Discuss your observations with your classmates.
Are the samples that change the colour of the ﬂ ower extract 
to a shade of red the same as those that changed the colour 
of blue litmus paper to red? (Group A, Table 2.2)
Are the samples that change the colour of the ﬂ ower extract 
to a shade of green the same as those that changed the colour 
of red litmus paper to blue? (Group B, Table 2.2)
Are the samples that do not change the colour of the ﬂ ower 
extract the same as those that did not change the colour of 
red and blue litmus papers? (Group C, Table 2.2)
From the above activity, we can conclude that the red rose 
extract can also be used to test the nature of the substances; 
hence, it is another example of an acid-base indicator. We can 
conclude that the red rose extract seems to give red colour in an 
acidic solution and green colour in a basic solution.
Can you now ﬁ ll in the nature of the substances in Table 2.3?
Add 
20 – 30 
drops 
of 
lemon juice in test tube A 
and 20 – 30 drops of soap 
solution in test tube B with 
the help of droppers. 
Observe and record any 
colour changes (Fig. 2.8) to 
the extract in Table 2.3. 
Repeat the same with the 
other 
samples

We are sure that you will be excited about the above results. 
You may repeat the process of preparing the extract and testing 
substances with some vegetables, fruits, or ﬂ owers, such as 
beetroot, purple cabbage, turmeric, Indian blackberry (jamun), 
and red hibiscus (gudhal) ﬂ ower. They can also act as acid-base 
indicators.
FASCINATING FACTS
Hydrangea is a plant that 
grows in cooler climates in 
the Himalayan region and the 
North-eastern states. It gives 
ﬂ owers of diﬀ erent colours, 
depending on the nature of the 
soil. Acidic soil produces blue-
coloured 
ﬂ owers, 
whereas 
in basic soil, the ﬂ owers are 
pink or red. Can gardeners alter the colour of hydrangea ﬂ owers by 
adjusting the acidic or basic nature of the soil?

2.1.3 Turmeric as an indicator
We have used blue and red litmus paper strips in Activity 2.1. Can 
you also make paper strips with some other natural indicators? 
Find out by performing the following activity.
Activity 2.5: Let us prepare
Take a spoonful of turmeric (haldi) in a petri dish or container 
and add a little water to make a paste (Fig. 2.9a). You may 
also grind a piece of fresh turmeric.
Carefully dip a piece of ﬁ lter paper in the turmeric paste 
until it gets yellow colour.
Take it out and allow it to dry.
Cut this yellow paper into thin strips, which are used as 
‘turmeric paper’ (Fig. 2.9b).

Based on the observations, we can conclude that turmeric 
paper can be used to test basic substances. However, it cannot 
diﬀ erentiate between acidic and neutral substances.
FASCINATING FACTS
Why is turmeric known as a ‘Golden’ spice?
Turmeric is a member of the ginger family, 
which is grown in India and other countries. 
A common spice in daily households, it is being 
researched for beneﬁ ts beyond the taste and 
colour it provides to the food! In the Ayurvedic 
system of medicine, turmeric is considered to have numerous health 
beneﬁ ts, and is commonly used in several traditional home remedies.

of this concept.
Are there any substances 
whose odours change on 
adding acidic or basic 
substances?
I respect my teacher as she nurtured 
curiosity within me and bestowed 
upon me the gift of learning. I bow 
my head in gratitude to her!
There are some substances whose odours change in an acidic 
or basic medium. These are called olfactory indicators. 
Let us explore more!
Activity 2.6: Let us investigate
Take some ﬁ nely chopped onions in a container, along with 
some strips of clean cotton cloth or ﬁ lter paper.
Tightly close the container and leave it overnight.
Take two of the cotton cloth or ﬁ lter paper strips from the 
container and check their odour.
Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of 
tamarind water on one strip and a few drops of baking soda 
solution on the other. Allow the drops to spread on the strips.
Check the odour again.
Do you notice any change in the odour of the onion strips 
before and after putting tamarind water and baking soda 
solution on them?
Note your observations. 
Similarly, test the change in the odour with other acidic and

2.2  What Happens When Acidic Substances 
Mix with Basic Substances?
Let us investigate by performing the following experiment.
Activity 2.7: Let us experiment
Take one drop of lemon juice in a test tube and 
add around twenty drops of water to it. Observe 
the colour.
Add a drop of blue litmus solution to it.
Do you observe any colour change (Fig. 2.10a)?
Slowly add drops of lime water to this test tube with 
the help of a dropper and swirl it well. 
What do you observe? Is there any change in the 
colour of the solution?
A stage comes when the colour of the solution 
changes from red to blue (Fig. 2.10b).
Again, add one drop of lemon juice to the above 
solution.
Can you predict why there is a change in colour?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
18
Initially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the 
lemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When 
lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution 
eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution 
in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised 
the eﬀ ect of the acid.
When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a 
base in suﬃ  cient quantity, we ﬁ nd that the resulting solution is 
neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation
reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed 
with the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. 
Acid + Base →Salt + Water + Heat
There are many examples in everyday life where you can 
observe the use of neutralisation processes.
Let us ﬁ nd out!
  2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life
y
Situation 1: Keerthi was observing a butterﬂ y in 
the garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk. 
Suddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red 
with stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped 
her by applying moist baking soda to the aﬀ ected 
area, which relieved the pain. What do you think 
might be the reason for this? 
When an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid 
(formic acid) into the skin. The eﬀ ect of the acid 
can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda, 
which is a base.
What remedies do people use to treat ant bites 
in your region? 
Situation 2: On the Farmer’s Portal (an 
online platform from the Department of 
Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers 
Welfare), a query from a farmer states, “My 
plants are not growing well lately”. After 
a detailed discussion, it was found that 
the excessive use of chemical fertilisers 
(substances added to soil to help plants 
grow better) made the soil acidic. What 
remedy might be provided to him? 
When the soil is too acidic, the plants 
do not grow well. It can be treated with 
lime, which is a base. (Fig. 2.12).
Fig. 2.11: Stinging eﬀ ect 
of an ant bite
Fig. 2.12: Neutralising the acidic 
nature of soil
 Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral
19
If the soil is basic, organic matter like manure and composted 
leaves are added to it. Organic matter releases acids that 
neutralise the basic nature of the soil.
Sometimes, the soil may be neutral, but the plants growing in 
it may still show poor health, which can be due to the deﬁ ciency 
of nutrients in the soil.
Situation 3: Ashwin’s friend Gurbir stays near an industrial area. 
He shared with him that the ﬁ sh population in his neighbourhood 
lake was declining day by day! What do you think might be the 
causes for this? It may be due to factory waste being released 
into the lake. 
If the factory waste is acidic in nature, what could be done to 
save the ﬁ sh in the lake? 
The factory waste can be neutralised by adding basic 
substances before releasing into the lake.
Let us wrap up!
Now, can you explain why the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful 
World of Science’ appeared on Ashwin and Keerthi’s paper sheets 
when the liquid was sprayed on them? 
Do you think that one possibility could be using a turmeric 
solution for the spraying liquid and a soap solution for writing 
on the paper?
In a Nutshell
Substances around us may be classiﬁ ed as acidic, basic, and 
neutral in nature. 
Extracts of lichen, red rose, red hibiscus, purple cabbage, 
turmeric, etc., can be used to indicate the nature of substances.
Substances that show diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic 
solutions are called acid-base indicators.  
Acids turn the colour of blue litmus to red. Bases turn the 
colour of red litmus to blue. 
Extract of red rose gives red colour in acidic solutions and 
green colour in basic solutions. 
The yellow colour of turmeric turns red in basic solutions 
but remains unchanged in acidic and neutral solutions.
An acid and a base neutralise each other, forming salt and 
water, along with the evolution of heat.
Many day-to-day problems like a red ant bite, acidic or basic 
nature of soil, and industrial waste can be attempted to be 
managed by the process of neutralisation.

Textbook of Science for Grade 7
Foreword
The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education 
in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational 
accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. 
At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively 
with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. 
The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the 
National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 
across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent 
abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the 
Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning 
at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as 
a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary 
Stages. 
The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with 
the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It 
endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative 
capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities 
that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging 
from three languages—including at least two languages native to 
India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical 
Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their 
holistic development. 
Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential 
conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different 
curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating 
between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious 
balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration 
and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and 
teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections 
both within and across curricular areas.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on 
its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality 
textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been 
constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, 
pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made 
all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Curiosity, Textbook 
of Science for Grade 7 aligns with NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, 
fostering experiential learning through real-world examples. It 
encourages curiosity, exploration, questioning, and critical thinking. 
iv
iv
The content attempts to integrate science subjects such as physics, 
chemistry, biology, and earth science with cross-cutting themes like 
environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and 
Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). By incorporating hands-on activities, 
the textbook engages students in an integrated approach, promoting 
reflection and group discussions. The textbook emphasises creativity 
and innovation, positioning students as active learners. Additionally, 
the adopted pedagogy encourages critical thinking, reasoning, and 
decision-making. The textbook provides ample opportunities for 
peer learning, which enhances the overall learning experience for 
both teachers and students. The focus is on collaboration and active 
engagement through student-centred approach to education. 
However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should 
also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. 
School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. 
Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in 
guiding and encouraging students to do so. 
With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been 
involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet 
the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite 
suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement 
in the coming years.

About this Book
We hope you enjoyed exploring the wonderful world of science in 
Grade 6, guided by the textbook Curiosity. You might still have more 
questions in science that you wish to explore! The Grade 7 textbook, 
the second in the Curiosity series picks up where we left off in Grade 6, 
continuing this exciting journey and helping you explore even more 
questions that you may wonder about. 
The Grade 7 textbook has been carefully crafted in alignment with 
the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP)  2020 
and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 
(NCF-SE) 2023. The textbook has been designed to meet curricular 
goals, covering key scientific concepts like matter, the physical and 
living world, health, hygiene, and the connection between science, 
technology and society. Like the Grade 6 textbook, this textbook 
also focuses on the nature of science and its processes. Each chapter 
includes creative activities, thought-provoking questions, and helpful 
illustrations. The textbook combines concepts from biology, chemistry, 
physics, and earth science, while weaving in cross-cutting themes like 
value education, inclusive education, environmental education, and 
the Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The goal is to encourage hands-
on learning rather than rote memorisation. Through this approach, 
the Curiosity series aims to help learners think critically and become 
responsible members of society.
Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 7, has twelve chapters. 
Chapter 1, titled ‘The Ever-Evolving World of Science’, gives an overview 
of the ideas covered in the book and aims to get the readers excited 
about learning more about science. It develops a thread connecting 
all other chapters, showing how they are all linked together. It also 
highlights that science is primarily a way of thinking, observing, 
asking questions, and discovering by doing. It is a process rather than 
a compilation of facts. This fun introductory chapter is meant to excite 
the students and is non-evaluative.
The chapters start with real-life situations to grab the students’ 
attention and to help them relate with their previous knowledge. 
The activities in the book are designed to give learners hands-on and 
minds-on experiences. These activities are inclusive and encourage 
working together to promote collaborative learning. After each 
activity, there are questions to help learners check their understanding 
and see how much they have learnt. We hope the questions make the 
students think deeply, reflect, and analyse ideas critically to arrive at 
a conclusion.

To sustain the readers’ interest, some challenging ideas, 
additional information, interesting facts, and other engaging 
materials are presented in various boxes.

Some chapters also feature 
sections called ‘Know a Scientist,’ 
where students can learn about 
the contributions of Indian and 
international scientists related 
to the relevant topics. 
Know a Scientist
This section includes brief biographies and shows how 
scientists have made a difference. Each chapter includes 
highlighted words that emphasise key concepts explained in 
the chapter. Some highlighted words outline the procedures 
in scientific activities. An interesting non-evaluative 
element that has been incorporated in some of the chapters 
is the introduction of certain verses from various Indian 
texts to promote rootedness in the learners as envisaged in 
NEP 2020. 
The 
box 
‘Fascinating 
Facts’, highlights fun facts, 
interesting  observations, and 
curiosity-driven questions.

‘In a Nutshell’ presents the summary of a chapter, 
offering an overview of the key ideas discussed.
In a Nutshell
 
Let Us Enhance Our Learning
‘Let Us Enhance Our Learning’ includes a range of 
exercises, from pictorial questions and puzzles to 
multiple-choice questions, offering a challenging and 
engaging experience. 
These questions not only help in self-evaluation 
but also evaluate the competencies developed in each 
chapter. We recommend that questions for evaluation 
be similar to the ones in this section.
Exploratory Projects
 
A unique feature of the book is ‘Exploratory Projects’, which 
involves activities designed to encourage the interaction of 
learners with their peers, parents, teachers, experts, and the 
community. 
Learners are encouraged to gather diverse information and 
draw their own conclusions. Some projects may require prior 
preparation and collaboration.
The textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should also 
explore and observe their surroundings. Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) can further enhance learning 
when used appropriately. The QR codes across the textbook 
provide access to interactive resources like audio and video 
clips, puzzles, games, quizzes, and additional content, allowing 
learners to explore at their own pace and convenience.
The journey of each learner through this science textbook is 
expected to be filled with joy. We hope that the curiosity sparked 
by this book will continue in the higher grades! We express 
our gratitude to all the members of the Textbook Development 
Committee for their contributions in shaping this textbook. We 
look forward to the feedback of the readers.

One morning in Kanniyakumari, Tamil Nadu, 12-year-old 
Rashmika was eagerly cycling to school. She was excited. That was 
the day her science teacher had dedicated a class for students to 
share and try to explain interesting observations.
Rashmika had been noticing that the coconut tree shadows 
were long in the morning but shorter in the afternoon on her 
way back. She thought about it and decided that the size of the 
shadows changed because the Sun moved across the sky during 
the day. But she also remembered learning that the Earth moved 
around the Sun (in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity) so she was puzzled. She wondered — does the 
Sun move in the sky? Or does the Earth move?

12.1 Rotation of the Earth
You might have also noticed that the Sun rises in the East and sets in 
the West. Have you ever wondered why? Let us try to understand 
why. Have you ever enjoyed riding a merry-go-round at a park or 
at your school? Let us go back to riding a merry-go-round!
Activity 12.1: Let us explore
Sit on a merry-go-round facing towards the outer side as 
shown in Fig. 12.1.
Fig. 12.1: A girl observing objects around 
her while riding a merry-go-round
Ask someone to turn the merry-go-
round slowly in the anti-clockwise 
direction as shown in Fig. 12.1. While 
you are sitting on the moving merry-
go-round, look around you. Do the 
objects around you appear to be 
moving? In which direction do they 
appear to be moving? 
While you turn in the anti-clockwise 
direction, the objects appear to turn 
around you in the opposite direction, that 
is, in the clockwise direction.
Now ﬁ x your gaze at a particular tree 
(or a building) ahead of you while 
sitting on the merry- go-round turning 
around in anti-clockwise direction.
In which direction do you ﬁ nd the tree turning around you? Is 
it in your view all the time?
The tree appears to turn around you in the opposite direction, 
that is, the clockwise direction. The tree appears in your view 
from your left-hand side and then moves out of your view on the 
right-hand side when you view it from a merry-go-round turning 
around in anti-clockwise direction.
Using the observations made by us while riding a merry-go-
round, let us now think. When we view from the Earth, the Sun 
appears in the East, moves across the sky from the East to the West 
and disappears in the West. Does it indicate that the Sun is moving 
in the sky? Or might it be that the Earth itself is turning around 
and the Sun just appears to move?
The fact is that the Sun appears to be moving because we view 
it from the Earth, which is turning around itself. 
Earth, Moon, and the Sun

In which way is the Earth turning around itself? To visualise 
this, let us recall some of the objects which turn around themselves. 
Have you watched a top spinning around its spindle (Fig. 12.2a)? 
Or a spinning fan (Fig. 12.2b)? Or tried spinning a ball (Fig. 12.2c)?

In a similar manner, the Earth also spins (or 
rotates) on its own axis in space as shown in Fig. 12.3. 
The Earth’s axis of rotation passes through its 
geographic North Pole and the South Pole. The Earth 
completes one rotation in about 24 hours.
When viewed from the top of the North Pole 
(Fig. 12.3), the Earth is rotating in the anti-clockwise 
direction, that is, from West to East.
Let us try to understand this with the help of a 
globe. You have used a globe in Grade 6 to represent 
the Earth and identiﬁ ed North Pole, South Pole, and 
Equator on it. You also learnt that its axis passed 
through its North and South poles (in the Grade 6 Social 
Science textbook Exploring Society India and Beyond).
Activity 12.2: Let us explore
Use a globe to represent the Earth and place a small 
sticker to mark your location on it (Fig. 12.4a). 
While viewing from above the North Pole, slowly 
rotate the globe on its axis in anti-clockwise 
direction. 
Observe how your location turns around 
and ﬁ nally comes back to its original position 
completing one rotation.
Rotation is the motion of an object 
in which all its parts move in circles 
around an imaginary line that passes 
through it. This line is called the axis 
of rotation.

Fig. 12.4(b): Using a globe and a torchlight to 
understand day and night
Use a torch to represent the Sun. Go 
to a relatively dark room to carry 
out the further steps of the activity.
Now, shine light from the torch 
placed 
at 
some 
distance, 
say 
1.5 metres, on the globe as shown in 
Fig. 12.4b. Do you notice how half 
of the globe receives the light from 
the torch, while the other half stays 
dark? 
It is day time in that half of the globe 
which receives light, and night time in 
the other half.
In India, sunrise ﬁ rst occurs in 
the eastern part and then in other 
parts. While looking at the eastern part of India on the globe, 
rotate the globe in one direction and then in the opposite 
direction. What is the direction of rotation when light falls on 
the eastern part of India ﬁ rst? 
The light falls on the eastern part of India ﬁ rst when the globe 
rotates from West to East with respect to the North-South axis of 
the globe. 
Now while rotating the globe from West to East, observe your 
location on the Earth. Does it go through a cycle of day and 
night?
Sunrise occurs as your location moves into light and sunset 
occurs as it moves into darkness.
The Earth’s rotation from West to East causes the day-night 
cycle. As shown in Fig. 12.5, the side facing the Sun experiences 
daytime, while the other side is dark and experiences night.

to understand how day and

to its rotation.

Now imagine that you are standing on the Equator on the 
Earth and watching the sky during one rotation of the Earth while 
it rotates from West to East. What will you observe? Will your 
observation be the same as that of the girl shown in Fig. 12.6?

has started to disappear 
from my view to the left

will now become visible

Due to the rotation of the Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the

and set in the westward direction (Fig. 12.6). Then the night begins 
and the stars become visible in the sky.
FASCINATING FACTS
In an earlier chapter ‘Measurement of Time and 
Motion’, you learnt how the scientist Galileo 
discovered an important property of a pendulum, 
and in the seventeenth century, another scientist, 
Huygens, used that property to make pendulum 
clocks that measured time. In the middle of 
nineteenth 
century, 
another 
scientist, 
Leon 
Foucault, used a long pendulum to give the ﬁ rst 
simple demonstration of the Earth’s rotation. The 
pendulum, known as a Foucault pendulum in his 
honour, consists of a long string with a heavy bob, 
suspended from a high ceiling.
A Foucault pendulum with a length of 22 metres 
has been hung from a skylight in the Constitution 
Hall of the new Parliament building in New Delhi, 
India. It symbolises the integration of the idea of 
India with the vastness of the cosmos.

Yes, indeed! Let us look at the 
stars in the night sky to see the 
eﬀ ect of Earth’s rotation.
Activity 12.3: Let us explore
On an early evening between March and May, identify the 
Big Dipper (Saptarishi), and the Pole Star (Dhruva Tara), if 
visible, as you did in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 
Science textbook Curiosity.
Note down your location and date 
of your night sky observations. 
The activity must be carried out 
on the same night.
Draw the orientation of the Big 
Dipper in the sky with respect 
to the Pole Star (or a ﬁ xed 
tree/building on the ground 
in a direction towards the Big 
Dipper if you cannot see the 
Pole Star). Mark the time of your 
observation along with your 
sketch as shown in Fig. 12.7. 
After two hours, observe the Big Dipper again. Has it moved? 
Again, draw its orientation and note down the time.
Repeat the above step after two hours. Do you observe that 
the Big Dipper appears to move around the Pole Star (notice 
just the movement even if you cannot see the Pole Star)? 
The Earth’s axis of rotation points very close to the Pole Star in 
the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Pole Star appears nearly 
stationary in the sky from the Earth. All the stars appear to move 
around it. Just like the Sun, the Moon also appears to rise in the 
eastward direction and set in the westward direction because the 
Earth rotates from West to East.
FASCINATING FACTS
Astrophotographers take long exposure 
photographs, keeping the camera’s 
shutter open for a long time. In such

the stars is recorded as arcs of a circle, 
known as star trails.

FASCINATING FACTS
Ancient Indian astronomers, including Aryabhata, had also 
noticed the daily apparent motion of the celestial objects, such 
as the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. Aryabhata was a famous 
mathematician and astronomer of ancient India who wrote an 
important treatise, Aryabhatiya, around the ﬁ fth century CE. The 
apparent motion of the stars due to the rotation of the Earth is 
explained in Verse 9, Golapada, Aryabhatiya.

¥¿ÜæçÙ ÖæçÙ ÌmÌ÷ï â×Âçp×»æçÙ ÜVæØæ×÷ïH
Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees stationary objects as 
moving backwards, so also the stars that are stationary are seen 
by people of Lanka as moving towards the west.
Aryabhata’s stated value for the time taken by the Earth to 
complete one full rotation about its axis is around 23 hours 56 
minutes 4.1 seconds (in modern units). This value is impressively 
close to the currently accepted value.
I have seen that the stars and 
constellations that appear in the 
East at sunset change during 
diﬀ erent months.
Yes. Maybe that is why we were told to 
look for certain stars and constellations at 
certain times of the year in Grade 6. But, 
why do diﬀ erent stars appear in the night 
sky over the course of a year?
12.2 Revolution of the Earth
While rotating on its own axis, the Earth also revolves around the Sun 
as we learnt in Grade 6. This movement is diﬀ erent from rotation. 
Revolution is the motion of an object around another object. 
Curiosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7
176
The path an object takes while revolving around another object 
is called its orbit. If viewed from the top (Fig. 12.8), the orbit of the 
Earth around the Sun is nearly circular. (In the ﬁ gure of the Solar 
System given in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity, the orbit appeared elongated because it was 
a side view of the orbit). The Earth completes one revolution
around the Sun in about 365 days and 6 hours.
12.2.1 Changing view of night sky from the Earth
Every evening the Sun sets in the westward direction and the night 
sky becomes visible. We know that this occurs due to the Earth’s 
rotation. As the Earth also revolves around the Sun continuously, 
the stars seen in the night sky after sunset gradually change over 
a year as we look in diﬀ erent directions, as shown in Fig. 12.8.

12.2.2 Seasons on the Earth
I have noticed that we go 
through a cycle of seasons 
every year. Is it related to 
the revolution of the Earth 
around the Sun in some 
way?
I have also noticed 
that days are longer 
in summer than in 
winter.
The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the 
orbit, but is tilted. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits around 
the Sun (Fig. 12.9). The tilt of the Earth’s axis and the spherical 
shape of the Earth gives rise to seasons. Let us ﬁ nd out, how.

In June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun while 
the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun (Fig. 12.9). 
As seen in Fig. 12.10a, a given amount of sunrays are spread in 
a smaller area in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the 
Southern Hemisphere due to the spherical shape of the Earth’s 
surface. So that area is heated more.
Further, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight for more 
than 12 hours in June (Fig. 12.11a). So, the Northern Hemisphere 
experiences more intense sunlight, which lasts for a longer time, 
causing the summer season. In December, the situation is opposite 
in the Northern Hemisphere and it experiences winter season 
with sunlight for shorter time (Fig. 12.10b and Fig. 12.11b).

The seasons and length of daytime are reversed in the 
Southern Hemisphere as compared to the Northern Hemisphere. 
There, it is winter in June and summer in December (Fig. 12.10 
and Fig. 12.11). 
Two incorrect reasons often given to explain why seasons occur 
on the Earth are:
When the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, it is 
closer to the Sun.
The orbit of the Earth is an oval with the Sun slightly displaced 
from its centre so the Earth is at diﬀ erent distances from the 
Sun over the year.
However, the diﬀ erence in distances in either of these cases is 
very small and these are not the reasons why seasons occur on 
the Earth. In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the longest day occurs around 
21 June—this is known as summer solstice. After the summer 
solstice, the duration of a day becomes shorter while that of a 
night becomes longer. The shortest day and longest night in this 
Hemisphere occur around 22 December known as the winter 
solstice. Around 21 March and 23 September, the daytime lasts 
for 12 hours. In the Northern Hemisphere, these days are called 
the spring and the autumn equinox, respectively.

FASCINATING FACTS
At the North Pole, the Sun rises in the East direction on the equinox 
day — 21 March, and remains continuously in the sky for six months. 
The Sun sets on 22 September. The South Pole experiences the opposite 
behaviour. The polar regions thus experience continuous sunshine for 
six months followed by a six-month period of darkness.

On the equator, there is always 12 hours of sunlight and 12 
hours of darkness. There is little diﬀ erence in the intensity of the 
sunrays falling on the equator in diﬀ erent months. Thus, for the 
southern states of India that lie close to the equator, the eﬀ ect 
of seasons is not very prominent. Other eﬀ ects, such as local 
geographical features and proximity to oceans or seas, can also 
inﬂ uence these broader patterns seen in the two hemispheres, as 
you have learnt in social science. 
12.3 Eclipses
p
Day and night cycle, seasons, the life 
on the Earth... so much is dependent 
upon the Sun. Could the light from the 
Sun get blocked by the two planets
which are revolving between the 
Earth and the Sun?
The planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to 
the Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching 
us. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can 
do that. Do you remember studying in Grade 6 that the Moon is a 
natural satellite of the Earth and it revolves around the Earth as 
the Earth revolves around the Sun? 
Curiosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7
180
12.3.1 Solar eclipse
At certain times, the Moon can come in between the Sun and the 
Earth in a way that obstructs the light from the Sun from reaching 
us. This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the 
Moon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from 
the Sun that we see in the sky. 
Activity 12.4: Let us explore
Ask your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about 
5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun.
Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your 
outstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. 
Are you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your 
thumb?
You can cover the entire head of your friend 
with the help of your thumb, even though your 
thumb is much smaller than the actual size of 
your friend’s head. How could it be? The size of 
any object as seen by your eye — also known as 
apparent size — depends upon both its actual 
physical size and its distance from you. The 
thumb being much closer to you as compared to 
your friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and 
your friend’s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 
are similar.
The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are 
similar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though 
the Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon 
is much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon 
can appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth.
Though the planets Mercury and Venus are much larger than 
the Moon in size, they are also much farther from the Earth as 
compared to the Moon. Thus, their apparent sizes are very much 
smaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example, 
when Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as 
a tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This 
event, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.

a small area on the surface of the Earth as seen in Fig. 12.13. This 
area is in total darkness, and no part of the Sun can be seen from 
there. The observers in this area witness a total solar eclipse 
(Fig. 12.14a).

In areas where the Moon partially blocks out only some 
regions of the Sun, the observers see a partial solar eclipse 
(Fig. 12.13 and Fig. 12.14b). 
During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark 
during the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the 
Earth’s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the 
Moon’s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the 
total solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes. As the Moon 
begins to move away from the front of the Sun (Fig. 12.14c), we 
see a partial solar eclipse and daylight begins to return.
Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse
Caution— During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the 
Sun, thinking that it wouldn’t be strong enough to cause harm to our 
eyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to 
damage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar 
eclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses, 
binoculars, or telescopes.
Usually, 
astronomy 
organisations, such as planetaria 
and astronomy clubs hold eclipse 
viewing events during a solar 
eclipse (Fig. 12.15). 
Participating in such events 
is the best way to observe a solar 
eclipse since the organisers not 
only provide specialised eye 
protection for solar viewing, but 
also oﬀ er scientiﬁ c explanations.

This activity, similar to Activity 11.5, is to be set up by your 
teacher. A mirror can be used to project an image of the 
Sun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle 
throughout a solar eclipse can be diﬃ  cult. To solve this, make 
a movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small 
hole, half-ﬁ ll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small 
mirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it. Place the ball on 
a circular ring, like an adhesive tape ring, so it can be turned 
around easily. Adjust it until the Sun’s image appears on a 
wall or screen. Fig.  12.15 shows this set-up where the mirror 
is ﬁ xed to a green ball.
Caution — This activity should be performed strictly under 
supervision of a teacher. Take care not to direct the reﬂ ected 
light beam in anyone’s eyes.

People have observed eclipses and maintained records since 
ancient times. When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they 
feared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something 
blocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, 
even for a brief period of time, would have been extremely 
concerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in 
various parts of the world related to the activities that could not 
be carried out during eclipses—such as eating, cooking, or going 
out of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse 
occurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at 
the Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe 
the eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses 
provide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be 
observed otherwise.
FASCINATING FACTS
An eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages. 
Many ancient Indian astronomical texts provide calculations to 
predict eclipses. The best known and most referred text is the Surya
Siddhanta, which is written in the classical Sanskrit poetry tradition 
in rhythmic shlokas.
12.3.2 Lunar eclipse
As the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can 
block the sunlight from reaching the Moon. This is known as a 
lunar eclipse. On such days, we see the Earth’s shadow falling on 
the full disc of the Moon. Fig. 12.16 shows the arrangement of the 
Sun, the Earth, and the Moon during a lunar eclipse.

When the Moon is completely in the Earth’s shadow, it is 
called a total lunar eclipse. The bright disc of the Moon starts 
to appear dark red in colour and stays that way until the Moon 
moves out of the shadow of the Earth. When part of the Moon 
is in the Earth’s shadow and the rest of the Moon is visible, it 
is called a partial lunar eclipse. Unlike the Sun, we can safely 
watch the eclipsed full Moon with our naked eye.

KNOW A SCIENTIST
M.K. Vainu Bappu is known as the father of modern 
Indian astronomy. He led eﬀ orts in setting up 
many instruments and telescopes in India, such 
as the telescopes at Manora Peak near Nainital 
(Uttarakhand) and Kavalur (Tamil Nadu). The 
observatory at Kavalur has been named after him. 
He mainly studied stars and even discovered a 
comet. He also travelled to diﬀ erent parts of the 
world to study solar eclipses.
In a Nutshell
The Earth rotates on its own axis in about 24 hours. 
The Earth’s rotation from West to East causes day and night 
as well as the apparent motion of the Sun, the Moon, and 
the stars.
The Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 1 year 
to complete a revolution.
The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the 
orbit, but is tilted.
Seasons occur because of the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation 
and its spherical shape.
A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is in the path of the 
Sun as seen from the Earth, and sunlight is blocked from 
reaching the Earth. 
A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes in between 
the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight from reaching 
the Moon.

Exploratory Projects
Repeat Activity 12.2 but replace the torch with an electric 
lamp. Then place  the globe at diﬀ erent positions on a circle 
around the lamp while maintaining the tilt of the globe.
(i) Note down your observations regarding how much of 
the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the globe are 
illuminated at diﬀ erent positions.
(ii) Rotate the globe and take a note of the length of the day 
and night on diﬀ erent parts of the globe.
(iii) Repeat (ii) for diﬀ erent positions of globe on the circle.
The Earth goes around the Sun in an oval-shaped path. 
Draw two circles with the same centre, one with a radius of 
14.7 cm, and another one with a radius of 15.2 cm. If 1 cm 
corresponds to 10 million km, the two circles represent the 
closest and farthest distances from the Sun. Note how small 
is the diﬀ erence between these two distances.
Suppose the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation increases. Will 
it cause more extreme seasons? Find out if the tilt of Uranus 
is more than the Earth and about the seasons there. Write an 
interesting article for a newspaper or your school magazine 
about it. 
In reality, the planets move around a special point in 
the solar system, which is very close to the Sun but 
not exactly at its centre! The Sun also moves around 
the same point a little instead of staying perfectly still. 
Scientists use such tiny wobbles in the movement of 
other stars to discover exoplanets around them!

And once again, we’ve reached the last page of this book, and as 
we said earlier, it is certainly not the end of our curiosity — our 
jigyasa. We hope you’ve enjoyed the activities and experiments as 
you journeyed through the chapters. More importantly, we hope 
you asked a lot of questions! Now it is our time to ask you one.
Have you looked closely at the front and back covers of 
this science textbook? At ﬁ rst, they may just look like regular 
scenes from a playground or a running track, but if you observe 
carefully, you’ll ﬁ nd tiny hidden science clues connected to 
diﬀ erent chapters in the book! Take a closer look — maybe you 
will spot something related to what we discussed about motion 
or light, or maybe even about plants and animals? 
Challenge yourself to ﬁ nd as many science links with the 
chapters as you can (we think there are more than 25!). And 
who knows — you might ﬁ nd connections that the authors and 
illustrators hadn’t even thought about! That is exactly how 
discoveries in science were made — by someone just observing 
something new, something unusual in the world around them.
This textbook is just a small guide, a map to ﬁ nd our way 
around the diﬀ erent paths of science. Never stop asking questions, 
and remember, your curiosity is the spark that lights the ﬂ ame 
of exploration that will take you to incredible heights. And we’ll 
join you again, next year, for more adventures in science.

If your food is fully digested before you eat again, you won’t need medicine for pain.
(Thirukkural 942)
In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living 
Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, we learnt about 
processes essential for survival of living beings like nutrition, 
respiration, excretion, and reproduction. These are collectively 
called life processes. In this chapter, we will learn about life 
processes such as nutrition and respiration in detail.

Observe your surroundings and notice what animals eat. 
Animals eat diﬀ erent types of food. Bees and sunbirds suck the nectar 
of ﬂ owers, while infants of humans and many other animals feed on 
their mother’s milk. Snakes, like python, swallow the animals they 
prey upon. Some aquatic animals ﬁ lter tiny food particles ﬂ oating 
nearby and feed upon them. 
Animals, 
including 
humans, 
obtain 
energy from food, which enables them to 
carry out various life processes. Animals 
consume 
food 
that 
contains 
complex 
components, such as carbohydrate, protein, 
and fat. These complex food components 
have to be broken down into simpler forms 
before the body can use them. But how does 
this process happen? 
Breaking 
down 
of 
complex 
food 
components into simpler forms occurs in a 
long tube called the alimentary canal. This 
process starts in the mouth and ends at the 
anus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this 
canal, digestive juices secreted at diﬀ erent 
parts break it down into simpler forms. 
This simpler form of food is absorbed by 
diﬀ erent parts of our alimentary canal and 
transported to various parts of our body to 
carry out various functions.
9.1 Nutrition in Animals  
How do the complex food components get broken down into 
simpler forms and used by the body in various animals? Is this 
process the same in all animals or does it vary? Let us ﬁ rst try to 
understand this process in humans.
9.1.1 Digestion in human beings
Let us trace the journey of food inside our body as it passes 
through diﬀ erent parts of the alimentary canal.
Beginning with the mouth cavity
The journey of the food you eat begins when it enters your 
mouth. Your teeth break down food you eat into smaller pieces 
by the processes of crushing and chewing. This process of initial 
breakdown of food into ﬁ ne pieces is called mechanical digestion. 
Think about your favourite food. Does your mouth feel watery?

This happens because of more saliva that gets released when you 
recall your favourite food.
What do you think is the role of saliva in your mouth? What 
do you feel when you eat other types of food, such as chapati? Let 
us ﬁ nd out.
Take a small piece of chapati or a bite-sized portion of boiled 
rice and chew it properly for 30–60 seconds. At ﬁ rst, the chapati
or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you 
notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you 
ever wondered why this happens?
Chapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. 
Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch 
into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes 
sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break 
down components of food into simpler ones.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
A healthy mouth requires good oral hygiene. We should brush our 
teeth and clean our tongue twice a day, and rinse our mouth with 
water after each meal to prevent tooth decay and bad smell in the 
mouth. Find out the ways our elders were maintaing oral hygiene. 
Activity 9.1: Let us investigate
Take two test tubes and label them as ‘A’ and ‘B’. 
Take one teaspoonful of boiled rice in test tube A, and take a 
teaspoonful of boiled rice after chewing it for 30–60 seconds 
in test tube B. 
Add 3–4 mL of water in both the test tubes. 
Note the initial colour of the rice-water mixture in Table 9.1.
Add 3–4 drops of iodine solution into each test tube with the 
help of a dropper. Mix the content of each test tube separately 
and observe. 
Record your observations in Table 9.1.

Did you observe that the colour of boiled rice turned blue-black 
in test tube A, while in test tube B, chewed boiled rice either did 
not change colour or turned only a very light blue-black colour? 
What causes the change of colour in test tube A? In Grade 6, we 
learned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with 
starch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour 
indicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains 
chewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates 
that the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight 
change in colour, it indicates that starch is present only in very 
small amount. It has been broken down into simple sugars by 
the action of saliva. If the colour still appears in test tube B, what 
changes would you make in the activity to explore it further? 
Would the colour change if chewing time is increased? Try to 
ﬁ nd out by repeating the activity.
Now, we know that saliva secretion in the mouth helps break 
down starch into sugars. This process of breaking complex food 
components into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food 
is partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially 
digested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal. 
Food pipe (Oesophagus): A passage from the mouth to the 
stomach
When you chew your food, your 
saliva not only helps in digesting 
the starch but also moistens 
it, making it soft and easy to 
swallow. Your tongue helps in 
mixing chewed food with saliva 
and pushing this softened food 
into a long, ﬂ exible tube called 
the food pipe or oesophagus
(Fig. 9.2). But how does the food 
move down? 
The walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a 
wave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This 
movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and 
pushes the food forward.
Stomach
In the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The 
churned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining 
of the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice, 
acid, and mucus.

The digestive juice of the stomach breaks 
down proteins present in the food into simpler 
components. 
The acid not only helps break down proteins 
but also kills many harmful bacteria. The mucus 
protects the stomach lining from the acid, preventing 
damage. In the stomach, the food is partially digested 
and transformed into a semi-liquid mass, preparing 
it for the next stage of digestion.

FASCINATING FACTS
How did scientists learn about digestion in the human body?
The discovery of how the stomach works happened 
by chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin 
was accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated 
by a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound 
never fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole. 
This opening allowed Dr. Beaumont to observe 
digestion in the stomach as it happened. He conducted 
experiments on how diﬀ erent foods were broken 
down and studied how emotions aﬀ ect digestion.
Alexis St. Martin’s 
shotgun wound
Small Intestine
After its journey through the stomach, the partially 
digested food moves into the small intestine. Look 
at Fig. 9.4. It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary 
canal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised 
that although it is called small intestine, it is almost 
6 metres long—almost twice the height of your 
classroom! You will be surprised to know that the 
small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary 
canal. 
The small intestine receives digestive secretions 
from three sources—the inner lining of the small 
intestine itself, and two more structures associated 
with the alimentary canal—the liver and the 
pancreas (Fig. 9.4). The liver secretes bile, which 
is mildly basic in nature. Recall the neutralisation 
reaction in chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, 
Basic, and Neutral’. Bile neutralises acids present 
in the food moving down from the stomach and 
breaks down fats into tiny droplets, making its 
digestion easier.

126
The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice, which is also 
basic in nature and helps neutralise acids present in the food. 
Additionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates, 
proteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the 
small intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially 
digested carbohydrates into simpler forms. 
The digested nutrients pass on 
from the small intestine into the blood 
present in blood vessels found in the 
walls of the small intestine. This process 
is called absorption of nutrients. How 
are these nutrients absorbed from 
the small intestine? The inner lining 
of the small intestine is thin and has 
thousands of ﬁ nger-like projections 
(Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface 
area for eﬃ  cient nutrient absorption. 
These ﬁ nger-like projections allow 
the digested nutrients to pass into the 
blood, which carries them to diﬀ erent parts of the body. These 
nutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help 
the body function properly. 
Fig. 9.5: Inner lining of the small intestine 
0.5 mm
Large intestine
After most of the nutrients are digested and absorbed in the 
small intestine, what happens to the undigested food? It moves 
into the large intestine. The large intestine is about 1.5 metres 
in length. It is shorter than the small intestine. Then why is it 
called the large intestine? The reason is that it is wider than the 
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Celiac disease is a condition in which the body reacts 
to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. 
This reaction damages the inner lining of the small 
intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. As a result, 
the intestine cannot function properly. The only way 
to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain 
gluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good 
alternatives because they are naturally gluten-free.

small intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and some salts 
from the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This 
semi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the 
lower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the 
body is ready to get rid of it. Eating ﬁ bre-rich foods like fruits, 
vegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function 
properly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled 
through the anus—a process known as egestion. This is how your 
body removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy!
Isn’t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing 
nutrients from food and eliminating waste?
FASCINATING FACTS
The large intestine contains various small living organisms, 
such as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our 
digestive system healthy. They break down undigested food, 
especially ﬁ bre, and produce essential nutrients. Fibre-rich 
food, and especially ‘fermented foods’ (like curd, buttermilk, 
shrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for 
a healthy digestive system and overall well-being.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
The importance of digestion in maintaining good health has been 
recognised for centuries. The  Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic 
text, highlights the role of easily digestible foods and the judicious use 
of spices like ginger, black pepper, and cumin to enhance digestion. 
Advances in science in the area of nutrition also emphasise eating 
meals at proper timings, practising mindful eating, and avoiding 
overeating as key factors in maintaining digestive health.
9.1.2  Do all animals digest food the same way as 
humans do?
I have seen cows keep chewing 
the food even when they are 
not actively grazing or eating 
anything. Why?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
128
Grass-eating animals, such as 
cows (Fig. 9.6) and buﬀ aloes, 
partially 
chew 
the 
grass 
and swallow it into their 
stomachs. In the stomach, 
partial digestion of the food 
takes place. The partially 
digested food is brought back 
to the mouth for gradual 
chewing. 
This 
process 
is 
called rumination, and these 
animals are called ruminants. 
A cow spends about 8 hours a 
day just chewing the food! The 
thoroughly chewed food again 
passes down the alimentary 
canal for further digestion.

Gizzard

Oesophagus
Birds do not have teeth, 
but they have a chamber 
called a gizzard (Fig. 9.7). 
Food is broken down by the 
contraction and relaxation 
of the walls of the gizzard, 
often with the help of grit 
(small stones) that the birds 
swallow.
This shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure 
and function of the alimentary canal to adapt to diﬀ erent ways 
of digesting diﬀ erent kinds of food. 
We have learnt that the nutrients from digested food are 
carried to diﬀ erent parts of the body. Some of the nutrients help 
build and repair the body, while others, like sugar, are broken 
down inside the body to release energy. The process by which 
nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration. 
Let us now explore how this process occurs in animals.
9.2 Respiration in Animals
p
We learnt in Grade 6 chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their 
Characteristics’, that all living beings respire. Is the process of 
respiration the same in all animals? Let us ﬁ rst understand the 
process of respiration in humans.
Life Processes in Animals
129
9.2.1 Respiration in humans
You know that we breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale) air 
continuously to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. How 
is this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration 
diﬀ erent? Let us ﬁ nd out. 
How do we breathe?
The process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing. It is 
diﬃ  cult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or 
two, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a 
few minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not 
just humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we 
breathe? 
Just as food follows a speciﬁ c pathway in the digestive system, 
our body also has a speciﬁ c system for breathing and respiration. 
This system is called respiratory system. The respiratory 
system consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this 
system, the exchange of gases follows a speciﬁ c pathway. The 
pathway through which the air is inhaled and exhaled involves 
various parts of the respiratory system assisting in the process of 
breathing and respiration.
The respiratory system begins with a pair 
of nasal openings called nostrils through 
which we inhale and exhale air (Fig. 9.8). 
The inhaled air passes into a pair of small 
passages called the nasal passages. Have 
you noticed tiny hair inside your nostrils? 
These hair, along with mucus, help trap 
dust and dirt from the air we breathe in. 
This is why we should breathe through the 
nose and not through the mouth. From the 
nasal passages, the air reaches our lungs 
through the windpipe. The windpipe forms 
two branches, which enter the two lungs. 
In the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and 
ﬁ ner branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli 
(Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
While a lot of the dust is ﬁ ltered out from the inhaled air, often 
small infectious particles can get through the lungs. For example, 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus aﬀ ected 
the respiratory system, leading to breathing diﬃ  culties and 
often causing serious lung problems.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
130
Let us understand the mechanism of breathing by making a 
simple model.
Activity 9.2: Let us make a model 
Take a wide transparent plastic 
bottle with a lid. Remove its 
bottom. 
Make a hole in the lid of the bottle. 
Take a Y-shaped hollow tube, as 
shown in Fig. 9.9. 
Fix two deﬂ ated balloons to the 
forked end of the tube. Secure 
them with rubber bands to make 
them airtight. 
Insert the straight end of the tube 
tightly through the lid from the 
open base of the bottle and seal 
the lid with clay to make it airtight. 
To the open base of the bottle, attach a thin rubber sheet 
tightly using a large rubber band.
Pull the rubber sheet from the centre of the base downwards 
and watch the balloons (Fig. 9.9a). What do you observe? Now, 
release the rubber sheet upwards and observe the balloons 
(Fig. 9.9b). What changes do you see in the balloons? When you 
pull the rubber sheet downwards, the balloons inﬂ ate. Conversely, 
when you release the rubber sheet upwards, the balloons deﬂ ate.
When 
you 
breathe 
in 
(inhale), 
your 
chest 
expands as the ribs move 
up 
and 
outwards. 
The 
diaphragm (a dome-shaped 
muscle below the lungs) 
moves downwards during 
inhalation (Fig. 9.10a). This 
increases the space inside 
the chest, and air enters the 
lungs. When you breathe 
out (exhale), the ribs move 
down and inwards, and the 
diaphragm moves upwards 
(Fig. 9.10b), reducing space 
and pushing air out of 
the lungs.

To be demonstrated by the teacher 
Take an equal amount of freshly 
prepared lime water in two 
test tubes, A and B, as given in 
Fig. 9.11.
In test tube A, pass the air using 
a syringe/pichkari (Fig. 9.11a). 
This is the same air that you 
inhale.
In test tube B, repeatedly blow 
air through your mouth into 
the lime water using a straw 
(Fig. 9.11b).
Do you observe any changes in the colour of the lime water? 
The lime water in test tube B turns milky (or cloudy), but the lime 
water in test tube A does not. What does this indicate? Lime water 
turns milky when it reacts with carbon dioxide. Therefore, this 
indicates that the exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than 
the air we inhale.

Breathing Practices for a Healthy Life
Breathing exercises have been practised across diﬀ erent cultures 
in India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for 
improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration. 
In Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing, 
a technique that improves lung function and 
helps keep the body warm even in cold weather. 
Similarly, deep breathing techniques are used to 
promote well-being. Some traditions combine deep 
breathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath 
control to enhance relaxation and mental clarity.

How does the exchange of gases 
happen?
Through the process of breathing, 
fresh air from outside enters the 
lungs and ﬁ lls the alveoli. The alveoli 
have thin walls surrounded by ﬁ ne 
tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). 
Blood carries carbon dioxide from 
the body to the alveoli, where it is 
released into the air. At the same 
time, oxygen from the alveoli passes 
into the blood and is transported to 
all parts of the body. 
Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you 
energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we 
breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple 
substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose 
to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word 
equation of the process of respiration is as follows—
Glucose + Oxygen 
 Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy
During 
breathing, 
we 
inhale 
air 
from 
our surroundings and 
exhale air having more 
carbon 
dioxide 
than 
the inhaled air. Note 
that not all the oxygen 
is used up (Fig. 9.13). 
Some 
other 
animals 
can 
use 
a 
larger 
fraction of the oxygen 
during 
respiration. 
This exchange of gases 
ensures 
that 
each 
segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove 
waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and 
removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break 
down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, 
play, and even think!
Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical 
process that occurs inside the body. Both the processes are 
essential for our survival!

Our body has a unique system for the transport of nutrients, 
oxygen, and other substances. This system is called the circulatory 
system. It includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The heart 
pumps blood through blood vessels, ensuring the transport of 
nutrients, oxygen, and other substances to all parts of the body, 
while waste products are carried away.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Smoking is extremely harmful to health. It damages the lungs and 
increases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and 
other respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and 
frequent infections.
 In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic 
chemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers 
inhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which 
can be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and 
the elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both 
personal health and the well-being of those around us.
9.2.2  Do other animals breathe the same way as 
humans do?
You have learnt that diﬀ erent animals 
live in diﬀ erent habitats. You may have 
observed birds ﬂ ying and ﬁ sh swimming. 
How do they breathe? Animals, such 
as birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats, 
lizards, and snakes, breathe through 
their lungs. Although all these animals 
have lungs, the structure of their lungs 
are quite diﬀ erent. Most aquatic animals 
like ﬁ sh, have specialised structures 
known as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are 
richly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and 
carbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in 
water takes place across the gills. 
Amphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water. They 
use diﬀ erent body parts for breathing at various stages of their 
life. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs 
use lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when 
they stay in water. This adaptation helps them survive both in 
water and on land, showing how animals have adapted over time 
to diﬀ erent environments. Earthworms use their moist skin for 
the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. 
Gills

Thus, diﬀ erent animals have diﬀ erent breathing mechanisms 
to suit their unique habitats. Apart from the digestive system, the 
respiratory system, and the circulatory system, there are other 
systems which work in coordination with each other in the body 
and perform diﬀ erent functions to sustain life. You will study 
about them in higher grades.
In a Nutshell
Life processes such as nutrition, circulation, respiration, 
excretion, and reproduction are essential for the survival 
of living beings. These processes are collectively called life 
processes.
The human digestive system consists of an alimentary canal 
which includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small 
intestine, large intestine, and anus, and its associated parts, 
the liver and the pancreas. 
The digested food is primarily absorbed through the walls of  
the small intestine. 
The  nutrients absorbed are distributed through the blood 
to diﬀ erent parts of the body where they are used for 
performing various functions. 
The large intestine absorbs most of the remaining water and 
some salts from the undigested food.
Grass-eating animals such as cows and goats are called 
ruminants. They chew the food partially and swallow it. 
Later, the partially digested food is returned to the mouth, 
and the animal chews it thoroughly. 
Breathing involves the movement of air into the lungs 
(inhalation) and out of the lungs (exhalation).
The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the 
alveoli of the lungs.
Respiration uses oxygen from inhaled air to break down 
glucose into carbon dioxide and water. The process by which 
nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration.
The circulatory system transports nutrients  and oxygen to 
all parts of the body. It includes the heart, which  pumps 
blood through blood vessels, delivering oxygen and nutrients 
while also removing waste from the body.
Breathing is a physical process and respiration is a chemical 
process.
Diﬀ erent animals have diﬀ erent breathing mechanisms 
adapted to suit their habitats.

In Grade 6, we learnt that all living beings grow and need food 
for their growth. Also, in the previous chapter, we discussed the 
process through which animals obtain nutrition.  
We know that animals eat food to grow, but what about 
plants? Have you ever seen plants eating food like animals do? 
As animals grow, their size and weight usually increase, and their 
bodies undergo various changes. What changes do you notice in 
plants when they grow?
We learnt that food provides nutrients like carbohydrates, 
fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which, along with water, 
are all essential for growth. Let us explore how plants obtain 
nutrients for their growth.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

10.1 How Do Plants Grow?
Look around your neighbourhood. Have you observed any 
changes in a plant during its life span? As a plant grows, new 
leaves and branches emerge, its height increases, and its stem 
thickens. What do you think causes these changes? Discuss with 
your friends and provide your explanation as well. 
When we water plants 
regularly, they grow better. 
So, I think water also 
contributes to its growth.
I think sunlight plays 
some role in the growth 
of  plants.
Maybe plants take 
up food from the soil 
through their roots. 
I think, maybe, ________ 
plays some role!
Let us perform an experiment to test some of these explanations. 
Activity 10.1: Let us test some explanations 
Take three earthen pots (or used bottles/containers) of the 
same size ﬁ lled with garden soil. Plant saplings of similar sizes 
of a fast-growing plant like chilli or 
tomato in each pot (Fig. 10.1).
Label the pots A, B, and C.
Count the number of leaves on 
each sapling and record your 
observations.
Place pot A in direct sunlight. Keep 
the soil in this pot slightly moist 
by adding an adequate amount of 
water every day (Fig. 10.1a).

Analyse the observations recorded in Table 10.1, and discuss 
them with your teacher and friends.
You are likely to ﬁ nd that the plant in Pot A, kept in direct 
sunlight with adequate water, grows better than the plant in Pot 
C, which gets adequate water but no sunlight. The plant in Pot 
B may have died as it did not get water even though it received 
adequate sunlight.
What do you infer from the observations made in this activity? 
The results indicate that plants require both sunlight and water 
for their growth.

“Trees do not produce fruits and flowers merely because they are planted.”
This line is from an ancient Indian text named Vrikshayurveda. It records 
useful observations about plant growth, soil, and agricultural practices to 
help improve crop health, growth and production. The knowledge in the 
text seems to be based on practical experiences and patterns seen over

10.2  How Do Plants Get Food for their 
Growth?
We know that animals get their food from plants, either directly by 
eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that in turn eat plants 
for their nutrition and growth. But how do plants obtain the food 
they need to grow? Unlike animals, plants do not eat food. 
10.2.1 Leaves: the ̒ food factories̓ of plants
Plants store food in the form of starch, a type of carbohydrate. 
This starch is produced in the leaves of a plant which, by design, 
are generally broad and ﬂ at. These are mostly green because of 
the presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll, that helps in 
capturing sunlight eﬃ  ciently.
Let us ﬁ nd out the role chlorophyll plays in the preparation of 
food in the form of starch in plants.

Take out the leaf and place it on a plate. 
Now, put a few drops of diluted iodine solution with the help 
of a dropper on the decolourised leaf (Fig. 10.2b). Wait for a 
few minutes and observe.
If the colour of the leaf changes to blue-black, it indicates the 
presence of starch.
Caution — Alcohol should never be placed near a heat source directly, 
as it is highly ﬂ ammable and can easily lead to ﬁ re and burns. 
Did you wonder why we decolourise the leaf in the 
beginning of this activity?
Decolourisation of a leaf enables us to easily observe 
colour change and, thus, the presence of starch.

In Activity 10.1, we have learnt that water and sunlight are 
essential for plant growth. In Activity 10.2, we have discovered 
that green leaves store starch as food. 
Bhaskar loves gardening during his free time. Being a curious 
student, he often looks around his garden and wonders how 
plants produce food. From his experiences, Bhaskar knows 
that water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. But he 
wonders if sunlight contributes to the production of food in the 
form of starch in plants.
How does sunlight 
contribute in the production 
of starch in plants? 
Activity 10.3: Let us check 
Bhaskar took a leaf having both green and non-green patches 
from each of two similar potted plants — one kept in sunlight and 
the other kept in the dark for 36 hours. He wanted to compare 
the leaves before and after the starch test. 
He made a sketch of the leaves to record the location of the 
green and the non-green patches on them with the help of a 
tracing paper. After that, he performed an iodine test (as shown 
in Activity 10.2) on the leaves. Bhaskar recorded his observations 
in Table 10.2.

In Table 10.2, Bhaskar recorded a blue-black colour (indicating 
the presence of starch) on the green patches of the leaf obtained 
from the plant placed in sunlight. Bhaskar also recorded that the 
leaf obtained from the plant kept in the dark does not show a 
blue-black colour, even on the green patches, indicating that no 
starch has been produced. Non-green patches of the leaf obtained 
from the plant placed in sunlight do not turn blue-black. Does it 
indicate that there is no chlorophyll present in those patches? 
The non-green patches may not have suﬃ  cient chlorophyll to 
prepare enough starch to be detected using the iodine test. 
FASCINATING FACTS
Some plant leaves appear red, violet, 
or brown because they contain more 
of these coloured pigments than the 
green-coloured chlorophyll. This hides 
the green colour. Some of these pigments 
also help in photosynthesis. You can use 
an iodine test to check for the presence 
of starch in these leaves, indicating that 
photosynthesis has indeed taken place.

What do we infer from the observations listed in Table 10.2? 
As we know, leaves are mostly green because of the presence 
of chlorophyll. We have also seen that the starch is produced 
where green patches of the leaf are present. We can infer that 
chlorophyll helps in preparing starch in the presence of sunlight. 
In fact, it is essential for the preparation of starch. Hence, the 
leaves are also called ‘food factories’ of plants. 
What else is essential for the preparation of food in plants? 
Let us ﬁ nd out. 
10.2.2 Role of air in the preparation of food
Activity 10.4: Let us experiment 
(demonstration activity)
The teacher may demonstrate this activity.
Take a potted green plant and keep it in the 
dark for two to three days to allow it to destarch 
(i.e., lose any stored starch). Then, locate one 
leaf of this plant for this experiment.
Take a wide-mouthed bottle and pour some 
caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) into it 
(caustic soda absorbs carbon dioxide from 
the air). 
Caution — Caustic soda is a strong chemical that can 
cause skin burns; only teachers should handle it.
Insert half of the destarched leaf into the 
bottle through a split cork, leaving the other 
half of the leaf outside, and place the bottle as 
shown in Fig. 10.3a.

(Yes/No)
We notice that the part of the leaf that was outside the bottle 
turns blue-black, indicating the presence of starch. However, the 
part of the leaf inside the bottle does not turn blue-black in colour, 
indicating that food is not made in that part of the leaf. This is 
because the caustic soda solution inside the ﬂ ask absorbs the 
carbon dioxide present in the air. What does this experiment show?
This experiment shows that carbon dioxide present in the air 
is essential for plants to prepare starch. 
Based on Activities 10.3 and 10.4, what do you conclude? 
Which part of the plant is involved in the synthesis of starch?  
Based on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight, 
water, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the 
synthesis of food in plants. This process by which plants prepare 
food in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called 
photosynthesis. A leaf is the primary site for photosynthesis.  Do 
other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, 
other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform 
photosynthesis.
So far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from 
the air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the 
process of photosynthesis. But have you ever thought about what 
more happens during this process? Do plants only take in 
Life Processes in Plants

substances from their surroundings, or do they also release 
something? Let us explore this through an experiment performed 
by Barkha didi. 
Activity 10.5: Let us explore
Look at Fig. 10.4. Compare the 
two set-ups labelled as A and B, 
and analyse. 
In Fig. 10.4, set-up A is placed in 
sunlight, and set-up B is placed in 
the dark. What diﬀ erence do you 
observe in the two set-ups? Do 
you observe air bubbles emerging 
in the inverted test tube in set-up 
A? The gas produced in this set-up 
caused bubbles to emerge and get 
accumulated in the inverted test 
tube. Which gas is this?

She inferred that the gas in the test tube is rich in 
oxygen. It indicates that oxygen is released during 
the process of photosynthesis. It also indicates that 
photosynthesis occurs in the presence of sunlight.
When suﬃ  cient gas was accumulated in the 
inverted test tube, Barkha didi placed her 
thumb on the mouth of the test tube while 
taking the test tube oﬀ  the set-up. She then 
quickly inserted a lit matchstick into the tube 
and the matchstick produced an intense ﬂ ame. 
Oh yes! I remember. In our science lab,  I 
have seen a similar set-up placed under 
sunlight near a window. 
Based on Barkha didi’s experiment, we can conclude that 
oxygen is released during photosynthesis.

10.2.3 Photosynthesis: in a 
nutshell
We know that water, sunlight, carbon 
dioxide from the air, and chlorophyll 
are necessary to carry out the process 
of 
photosynthesis 
that 
produces 
carbohydrates 
(Fig. 
10.5). 
During 
photosynthesis, 
food 
is 
actually 
produced in the form of glucose, a 
simple carbohydrate. This glucose not 
only serves as an instant source of 
energy but also later gets converted into 
starch for storage. The word equation 
of photosynthesis is given below —
 
 
 
 
          Sunlight 
Carbon dioxide + Water 
  Glucose + Oxygen
 
 
 
 
       Chlorophyll
KNOW A SCIENTIST
Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an 
understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur 
(1896–1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. 
He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the 
Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, 
Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from 
1921–1935. He studied eﬀ ects of the amount of water 
and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the 
importance of water, temperature, and the colour of 
light in the process of photosynthesis. 
10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during 
photosynthesis?
We now know that photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, and 
oxygen is released in the process. Which part of the plant helps in 
the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen? Let us conduct an 
activity to understand where the exchange of gases takes place.

Activity 10.6: Let us examine 
(demonstration activity)
The teacher may demonstrate this activity.
Collect a leaf from a plant such as rhoeo, 
money plant, onion, hibiscus, coleus, or 
any grass.
Put it in a beaker ﬁ lled with water.
Carefully peel a thin layer from the lower 
surface of the leaf.
Place the peel in a watch glass with water.
Now, take a microscope slide and 
carefully put a drop of water on it.
Using forceps, transfer the peel of the leaf 
from the watch glass to the slide with the 
help of forceps.
Put a drop of ink on the leaf peel with the 
help of a dropper. 
Cover the peel with a coverslip and 
observe it under a microscope.
What do you observe? Do you notice tiny 
pores on the peel, as shown in Fig. 10.6? 
These pores are called stomata. Stomata, present on the surface 
of leaves, help in the exchange of gases.
10.3 Transport in Plants 
p
10.3.1 Transport of water and minerals
All living beings need water to grow. Plants use water in the 
process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in 
the soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important 
nutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals 
taken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant? 
We can study water transport in plants by carrying out an 
activity. For this activity, we require two glass tumblers, some 
water, red ink, and twigs of two similar tender plants, preferably 
with white-coloured ﬂ owers (for example, white sadabahar, 
balsam), as shown in Fig. 10.7.

Activity 10.7: Let us experiment
Take two tumblers and label them A and B. 
Fill one-third of each tumbler with water.
Add a few drops of red ink to tumbler B.
Obliquely cut the stems of both plants at their 
base while keeping them inside the water and 
immediately place one plant in each tumbler, 
as shown in Fig. 10.7a and Fig. 10.7b.
Observe these plants the next day.
What do you notice? Compare the plant 
stems placed in the tumblers. Do you observe 
red colour in the stem, leaves, and ﬂ owers of the 
plant from Tumbler B? Fig. 10.7c and Fig. 10.7d 
show the plants after one day. Compare the plant 
in Fig. 10.7c with that in Fig. 10.7d. A red colour 
is visible in the stem, leaves, and ﬂ owers of the 
plant in Fig. 10.7d. How did diﬀ erent parts of the 
plant acquire this red colour? 
Cut the stem from the upper part of the plant 
that is not immersed in the red-coloured water. 
Observe the cut stem using a magnifying glass.  Do 
you spot the red colour in the stem (Fig. 10.7e)? 
How does the red colour ink move upwards? This 
is due to the thin tube-like structure called the 
xylem present in the stem, branches, and leaves 
of plants. Just like red ink, minerals dissolved in 
water also move up the stem through the xylem.  
Now, we know that water and minerals are 
transported to the leaves and other parts of 
plants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water 
transported through the xylem is used to perform 
various functions. How does food get transported 
to other parts of a plant? 
10.3.2 Transport of food
We know that leaves are the primary site for 
photosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the 
leaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This 
food is transported through another set of thin 
tube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8). 
The transported food may also be stored in some 
other parts of a plant, such as seeds and roots.

10.4 Do Plants Respire? 
p
In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living 
Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, you learnt that all 
living beings respire. Do plants also respire like we do?
Activity 10.8: Let us ﬁ nd out
(demonstration activity)
Soak some moong bean seeds in water overnight.
Put a layer of cotton in a conical ﬂ ask (Fig. 10.9) and moisten 
the cotton with water to keep it wet. 
Place the soaked seeds over the wet cotton in the conical ﬂ ask. 
Cover the mouth of the conical ﬂ ask with 
a cork having two holes. 
Fit two tubes A and B through the two 
holes on the cork, as shown in Fig. 10.9. 
Leave it undisturbed for 24 hours in 
the dark.
Take two test tubes and ﬁ ll them with 
lime water.
Cover the mouth of one test tube with a 
cork having one hole in it.
Dip one glass tube in the test tube 
through a hole in the cork.
Connect the ﬂ ask and test tube with a rubber pipe as shown 
in Fig. 10.9.
Compare both the test tubes for any change in colour. Does 
the lime water turn milky in both the test tubes? Why does the 
lime water turn milky in the test tube connected to the ﬂ ask? 
Lime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon 
dioxide in the ﬂ ask. But where does this carbon dioxide come 
from? As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very 
small quantities in the air. In the ﬂ ask, additional carbon dioxide 
is produced by the seeds as they respire. 
During respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of 
oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The word 
equation for the proccess of respiration, is as follows — 
Glucose + Oxygen  
  Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy
The energy produced during respiration is used by plants 
for their growth and development. All parts of a plant, green or 
non-green, carry out respiration.
Thus, plants have diﬀ erent mechanisms for synthesising, 
transporting, and utilising food to get energy.

In a Nutshell
All living organisms require food that provide energy for 
their growth and development.
Plants use carbon dioxide and water in the presence of 
sunlight and chlorophyll to produce glucose and oxygen. 
This process of synthesis of food is known as photosynthesis.
Leaves are the ̒ food factories ̓ of a plant. 
Tiny pores on the surface of leaves, called stomata, help 
in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during 
photosynthesis and respiration.
The xylem transports water and minerals from roots, while 
the phloem carries food from leaves to all parts of the plants.
Plants break down glucose and release energy by a process 
called respiration. They use oxygen and release carbon 
dioxide in this process.

Develop a bottle garden by

a 
large 
transparent 
bottle 
(Fig. 10.13). After growing the 
plant properly for some time, 
seal the mouth of the bottle. 
Observe the growth of the 
plant. If the plant is growing well that means the plant is 
maintaining the exchange of gases, that is, carbon dioxide 
produced in the process of respiration of the plant is utilised 
for performing photosynthesis, and oxygen generated in 
photosynthesis is utilised in respiration by the plant inside 
the bottle.
How are plant processes like photosynthesis, respiration, and 
water and food transportation crucial for crop production? 
Visit a greenhouse, if there is one near your place. Observe 
how people grow plants in a green house. Find out how they 
regulate the amount of light, water, and carbon dioxide used 
to grow plants.
KNOW A SCIENTIST
Kamala Sohonie (1911–1998) was a woman scientist of India. She 
received a Ph.D. degree for her remarkable contribution in the area of 
respiration in plants from Cambridge University. 
She returned to India and worked at the Lady 
Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi, and later 
at the Nutrition Research Laboratory, Coonoor. 
Thereafter, she moved to the then Royal Institute 
of Science, Bombay, where she was eventually 
appointed as Director. Much of her work helped 
improve the nutritive values of plant foods. She 
also worked on the sap of the coconut palm as a 
nutritive drink called Neera.

In the Western Ghat region of Maharashtra, Keshav spends 
part of his summer vacation at his friend Jatin’s grandparents’ 
village. Having lived in a big city, he ﬁ nds the forests, fresh 
air, sounds of gushing streams, and chirping birds a novel 
experience.
However, for Keshav, the most fascinating sight is the 
dance of hundreds of ﬁ reﬂ ies at night, ﬂ ashing their lights 
in a wonderful performance. Jatin’s grandparents explain 
that ﬁ reﬂ ies are seasonal insects and they use light to 
communicate. Unfortunately, Keshav also learns the number 
of ﬁ reﬂ ies is decreasing due to light pollution, reduced forest 
cover, and excessive tourism.
At the end of their vacation, Keshav and Jatin board an 
evening bus back to their city. As the bus winds through the 
hilly roads, Keshav watches the moonlit landscape and the 
beams from the headlights of passing vehicles ﬂ ashing by. He 
is reminded of the many poems and songs about moonlight, 
and wonders — does the Moon actually produce its own 
light? Did we not learn in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the 
Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that all other objects in 
our solar system shine only by reﬂ ecting the light of the 
Sun? Is moonlight just reﬂ ected sunlight? Which objects give 
oﬀ  their own light? While thinking, he notices something 
strange — light seems to move in a straight line!
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

11.1 Sources of Light
g
The Sun gives out or emits its own light and is the main source 
of natural light on the Earth. Stars, lightning, natural ﬁ re, and 
certain animals also emit their own light (Fig. 11.1).
In ancient times, humans learnt to create 
ﬁ re — the earliest form of artiﬁ cial lighting. With 
time, they learnt to create 
ﬁ re using diﬀ erent fuels, 
such as animal fat, oil, 
wax, and gas (Fig. 11.2). 
With the invention of 
electricity and diﬀ erent 
kinds of electric light 
sources, 
most 
of 
the 
lighting needs of humans 
are now met by electric 
lighting (Fig. 11.3).
Objects that emit their own light are 
called luminous objects. Objects that 
do not emit their own light are called 
non-luminous objects. The Moon is a 
non-luminous object. It does not emit its 
own light. It just reﬂ ects the light emitted 
by the Sun that falls on it.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps are modern light 
sources that consume much less power, are brighter 
and last longer than traditional lamps. This not 
only reduces electricity bills but is also better for 
environment. Recognising their advantages, the 
Indian government has made substantial eﬀ orts to 
promote the use of LED lamps nationwide. At their 
end of life, LED lamps must be appropriately disposed 
or recycled, and not thrown in the garbage.

11.2 Does Light Travel in a Straight Line?
g
g
Let us do an activity to try to ﬁ nd out.
Activity 11.1: Let us investigate
Take three matchboxes and make a hole in 
the inner tray of each matchbox, exactly at the 
same position.
Arrange these three matchboxes in a straight 
line. Make sure that all three holes are exactly 
at the same height and are in a line as shown 
in Fig. 11.4.
Place a torch light on one side of the matchboxes, ensuring 
that its lamp is at the height of the holes.
Place a cardboard (screen) on the other side of the matchboxes 
and obtain a bright spot on it. (You may need to slightly adjust 
the heights of boxes.)
Move one of the matchboxes slightly to a side or up and down. 
Are you able to obtain the light spot on the screen now?
When all the three holes are not in the same line, we could not 
obtain the light spot on the screen. These observations suggest 
that light travels in a straight line.
Can we somehow 
check it in some 
other way?
I have an idea. Let us try 
to see the candle ﬂ ame 
through a bent pipe! 
Should we also try out this idea? 
Activity 11.2: Let us explore
Caution — Use a lighted candle under adult supervision 
only.
Take a long hollow pipe of some ﬂ exible 
material and align it so that you can see the 
candle ﬂ ame as shown in Fig. 11.5a.
Now, bend the pipe and try to see the candle 
ﬂ ame again (Fig. 11.5b). Can you still see it? 
You could see the candle ﬂ ame through a straight 
pipe but not through a bent pipe. This shows that 
light travels in a straight line.

beam of laser light inside water follows a 
straight path? 
However, light can sometimes even bend 
around corners! This is something you will 
learn in the higher grades.

Fig. 11.6: Passing light 
through different materials
List the materials of the objects in Table 11.1 and classify them 
into transparent, translucent, and opaque (In the chapter 
‘Materials Around Us’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity
you learnt to classify materials into transparent, 
translucent, and opaque, depending on how 
you could see through them).
Go to a dark room, turn on the torch, and place 
it at such a position that you get a spot of light 
from the torch on a wall. Or you may place a 
cardboard screen as shown in Fig. 11.6 and get 
the spot of light on it. 
We will now conduct this activity in two 
parts — prediction and observation.

Predict what will happen if you hold an object in front of 
the light coming out of the torch. Would you continue to 
see the spot of light on the screen? Note your prediction 
in Table 11.1.

Now, actually place the object between the torch and 
the screen. Does light pass through the object? Note your 
observation in Table 11.1.
Repeat this for all the objects.
Was your observation the same as your prediction? What 
conclusions could you draw? Light passes almost completely 
through transparent materials. Light passes partially through 
translucent materials. Light does not pass through opaque
materials.

11.4 Shadow Formation
What did you see on the screen in Activity 11.3 when 
an opaque object was placed in the path of light? Did 
you see a dark patch on the wall? Why was this dark 
patch formed? 
We now know that light travels in a straight line. 
So, when an opaque object is placed in its path, light is 
blocked. The dark patch, where light does not reach, 
is the shadow. 
Fig. 11.7: Shadows around us
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
158
We have noticed shadows of ourselves and other objects 
around us when we are in the Sun or under a light (Fig. 11.7). 
Also, you might have had fun making diﬀ erent shapes with 
shadows sometime.  
Do translucent and transparent objects create shadows or not? 
Did you notice that in Activity 11.3? Opaque objects form darker 
shadows. Translucent objects make lighter shadows. Even some 
transparent objects can create faint shadows!
Let us learn more about shadows.
Activity 11.4: Let us explore
Collect some opaque objects of diﬀ erent shapes and sizes. 
Repeat Activity 11.3, but this time, carry out the actions 
mentioned in the ﬁ rst column of Table 11.2.
Observe the shape and size of the shadow on the screen for 
each of the actions. 
Did the shadow form in all cases? Was the shape and size of the 
shadow the same as the object?
Record your observations in the second column of Table 11.2.

What conclusions do you draw from this activity? What do 
we need to observe a shadow? Does the colour of the shadow 
change when the colour of the object is changed?
Shadows are formed when an object blocks light from falling on 
a screen. We need a source of light, an opaque object, and a screen 
Light: Shadows and Reﬂ ections 
159
to observe a shadow. The walls, ﬂ oor, ground, or any other surface 
acts as a screen for observing shadows in our daily life.
The shape, size, and sharpness of the shadow depend on the 
position of the object relative to the light source and the screen. 
The shadows may give information about the object or we may 
not be able to guess the object at all. Changing the colour of 
opaque objects does not change the colour of the shadows.
FASCINATING FACTS
Shadow play, or shadow puppetry, 
has been a part of our cultural 
heritage for centuries. In this art 
form, ﬂ at cut-out ﬁ gures called 
shadow puppets are placed between 
a light source and a screen. By 
moving the puppets and the light, 
puppeteers 
can 
create 
life-like 
movements, bringing the characters 
to life. Diﬀ erent regions have their 
own unique styles, like the Charma 
Bahuli Natya in Maharashtra, Keelu 
Bomme and Tholu Bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, Togalu Gombeyaata
in Karnataka, Ravana Chhaya in Odisha, Tholpavakoothu in Kerala, and 
Bommalattam in Tamil Nadu. These are used not only for entertainment 
but also communicate important messages to the community.
11.5 Reﬂ ection of Light
g
When the opaque object was a shiny object like a 
polished steel plate, I got a shadow on the screen, 
but I also saw that there was a bright spot of light 
on the wall on the opposite side. Why was it so?
Activity 11.5: Let us investigate
Find a shiny ﬂ at steel plate or a plane mirror, that is, a mirror 
that is ﬂ at and not curved. 
Take it outside and let the sunlight fall on the shiny surface. 
What can you do to redirect light on the wall on which the 
sunlight is not falling directly?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
160
What conclusion do you draw from your observations? This 
activity suggests that a shiny surface or a mirror changes the 
direction of light that falls upon it. This change in direction of 
light by a mirror is called the reﬂ ection of light. Let us try to 
understand the reﬂ ection of light by a mirror.
Activity 11.6: Let us experiment
Fig. 11.8: Using mirror to redirect 
sunlight on a wall
Turn the shiny plate or mirror in 
diﬀ erent directions to redirect the 
light onto a wall or a nearby surface 
(Fig. 11.8). Do you see a spot of light 
on the wall? Does it mean that the 
shiny plate or mirror has changed 
the direction of light?
Now, tilt the shiny plate or mirror 
in diﬀ erent ways and observe 
the light spot on the wall. Does it 
change position? Notice how light 
always travels in straight lines and 
changes direction when it falls on 
the shiny plate or mirror.
Take a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a comb, 
a sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper.
Using the black paper, close all openings of the 
comb, except for one to make a thin slit. 
Spread a white paper on a table, hold the comb 
perpendicular to the sheet of paper and shine 
the torch light on the slit. Adjust the comb and 
torch slightly till you see a thin beam of light 
along the paper which has passed through the 
slit (Fig. 11.9a).
Now, place the mirror in the path of the light 
beam while keeping the comb steady (Fig. 11.9b). 
What do you observe?
The path of the light beam is changed after falling 
on the mirror. The reﬂ ection of light occurs at the 
mirror.
mirror.
In a mirror, I can also see my 
face. Is that also due to the 
reﬂ ection of light?

11.6 Images Formed in a Plane Mirror
g
Look into the mirror. Do you see your face in it? What you see is 
a reﬂ ection of your face in the mirror. We also see reﬂ ections of 
other objects that are in front of the mirror. Let us try to ﬁ nd out 
more about this.
Activity 11.7: Let us experiment
Take a plane mirror and a pen or some other object.
Place the pen in front of the mirror as shown in 
Fig. 11.10.
What do you see in the mirror? It appears as if a similar 
pen is placed behind the mirror. The pen which appears 
behind the mirror is the image of the pen formed by the 
mirror. The pen itself is the object.
Now, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the 
mirror and compare the sizes of the images of the pen at 
each position. 
Are the two sizes the same? The image formed by a plane 
mirror is of the same size as the object.
Again, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the 
mirror and observe if the image is upright at each position. 
Does the tip of the pen appear on top at each position? An 
upright image is called erect. An image formed by a plane mirror 
is erect.
Now, place a screen vertically behind the mirror. Move it 
around. Do you get the image on the screen? Repeat this by 
placing the screen in front of the mirror.
The image formed by a plane mirror cannot be obtained on 
a screen.
Activity 11.8: Let us experiment
Stand in front of a plane mirror and look at your image 
(Fig. 11.11). Notice how far it appears to be from the mirror.
Now, stand close to the mirror. Is the image also closer to the 
mirror?
Stand at diﬀ erent distances from the mirror and notice how 
far the image appears to be from the mirror in each case. 
Do you ﬁ nd any relation between your distance from the 
mirror and the distance of your image from the mirror?

You might have noticed that when you stand close to the 
plane mirror, the image also appears to be close to the mirror. 
The image appears to be far from the mirror when you stand far 
from the plane mirror.
Raise your left arm. Which arm does your image raise?
Touch your right ear. Which ear does your image touch?
You ﬁ nd that your left appears right in your image and your 
right appears left in your image. This type of perceived left-right 
reversal is called lateral inversion. There is lateral inversion in 
the images formed by a plane mirror.

FASCINATING FACTS
When mirrors were invented is not known. Earlier, mirrors 
were made by polishing stone or metal. When glass mirrors 
started being made, the art of making metal mirrors got lost 
gradually. However, it still survives, for example, in Kerala, 
where Aranmula Kannadi, a unique metal surface mirror has 
been made for centuries.

11.7 Pinhole Camera
A pinhole camera is a device in which the light rays from an 
object pass through a tiny hole (a pinhole) and form an image on 
a screen.

Activity 11.9: Let us explore
Caution — Use a lighted candle under adult supervision 
only.
Take a piece of cardboard and a candle. Make 
a small hole in the cardboard.
In a dimly lit room, position the cardboard at 
a short distance from a screen.
Place a lighted candle in front of it as shown 
in Fig. 11.12a.
What do you see on the screen? Light coming 
from the ﬂ ame passes through the hole on the 
cardboard and forms an image of the candle ﬂ ame 
on the screen. Do you notice anything surprising? 
The image of the candle ﬂ ame is upside down, that 
is, inverted.
Let us now make a pinhole camera, which you can 
use outdoors.
Activity 11.10: Let us construct
Take two boxes of cardboard such that one can slide 
into another with very little gap in between them. 
Cut open one side of each box. 
On the opposite face of the larger box, make a small 
hole in the middle (Fig. 11.13a). 
On the opposite face of the smaller box, cut out a 
square from the middle with a side of about 5–6 cm. 
Cover this opening with a thin translucent paper 
(like a tracing paper) to form a screen (Fig. 11.13b).
Slide the smaller box inside the larger one in such 
a way that the side with the tracing paper is inside 
(Fig. 11.13c). 
Hold the pinhole camera with the pinhole facing the 
object and look through the open side of the smaller 
box. Cover your head and the camera with a dark cloth. 
Look at a distant object, like a tree or building, in bright 
sunlight and move the smaller box forward or backward 
until an image appears on the tracing paper.
Do the images seen in the camera show the colours 
of the objects on the other side? Are the images erect or 
upside down?

11.8 Making Some Useful Items
g
After having learnt that light travels in a straight line and is 
reﬂ ected by mirrors, it is time to create some useful items based 
on this learning.
11.8.1 Periscope
We can make a simple periscope by 
placing two plane mirrors in a Z-shaped 
box as shown in Fig. 11.14.
Reﬂ ection 
from 
two 
mirrors 
enables us to see objects that are not 
visible directly. Periscopes are used in 
submarines, tanks, or by soldiers to see 
outside their bunkers. You may use it 
to look ahead when standing behind 
taller friends.
11.8.2 Kaleidoscope
Get three rectangular plane mirror 
strips of equal width and join them 
together in a triangular manner as 
shown in Fig. 11.15a. You may use three 
strips of thick reﬂ ective paper instead 
of mirrors. Fix these in a circular tube 
of thick chart paper (Fig. 11.15b). On 
one end of the tube, ﬁ x a transparent 
plastic sheet using a rubber band or 
an adhesive tape. Place several broken 
pieces of coloured bangles or beads on 
this (Fig. 11.15c), and cover it with a 
tracing paper using a rubber band or 
an adhesive tape. 
When you peep through the open 
side, you view a beautiful pattern 
(Fig. 11.15d). Even if you leave both 
sides of the kaleidoscope open and

there is lateral inversion in the image formed by a mirror but it is 
not upside down. We will learn more about this in higher grades.

point it towards a tree or other objects, you see beautiful patterns. 
An interesting feature of the kaleidoscope is that one always gets 
to see a diﬀ erent pattern every time the kaleidoscope is turned 
about. Since there are 3 mirrors, and multiple images (due to 
reﬂ ections of reﬂ ections), many interesting patterns are formed. 
Designers and artists often use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new 
patterns.
In a Nutshell
Objects that emit their own light are called luminous objects.
Light travels in a straight line.
Light passes almost completely through transparent 
materials. Light passes partially through translucent 
materials. Light does not pass through opaque materials.
A shadow is formed when light is blocked by an object. 
Opaque objects form darker shadows. Translucent objects 
make lighter shadows. Some transparent objects can create 
faint shadows.
The change in the direction of light by a mirror is called 
reﬂ ection of light.
The image formed by a plane mirror is of the same size as 
the object, is erect, cannot be obtained on a screen, and is 
laterally inverted.
A pinhole camera creates an inverted image of an object on 
a screen.

Adolescence:  
A Stage of Growth 
and Change
6
The journey of a plant generally begins with the germination of a 
seed. With proper nourishment, the seed becomes a sapling and 
matures into a young plant. This journey is marked by some specific 
changes. Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the 
appearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits, 
and new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge.
It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities 
to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs 
to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing 
seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity 
before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch 
into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to 
young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size 
and develop over time.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
74
The journey of life of a human can be divided into different 
stages—infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. 
Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the 
duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another. 
From infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes. 
Until around 10–12 years of age, most changes are related to 
height and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to 
occur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid 
growth and development, typically occurring between the ages 
of 10–19. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood.
Humans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce 
immediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and 
reach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce.
As humans grow and develop, they experience significant 
physical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the 
ability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly 
observable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed. 
In this chapter, you will explore adolescence, understand its 
importance, and learn how to handle it with a sense of responsibility.
6.1	 Growing With Age: The Teenage Years
During the summer vacation, Venkatesh visited his grandparents. 
As he entered the house, his 12-year-old cousin, Devyani came 
running to greet him.
You have become 
so tall, Devyani!
Your voice has 
also changed!
Venkatesh, 
you 
have 
a 
thin 
moustache now!! 
Let us try to understand this interesting conversation 
between Venkatesh and Devyani.
Activity 6.1: Let us discuss
	
 Take a jar and some paper slips.
	
 Write down the changes you can notice among students as 
they go from Grades 5 to 8. These could be related to height, 
strength, behaviour, or any other aspect. Please avoid writing 
names on the slips.

 Fold the slips and place them in the jar.
	
 Mix all the slips received from the students in the class and 
unfold the collected slips one by one. Based on the information 
on the slips, discuss the changes with the students in the class.
What were the most commonly observable changes among 
students, as mentioned on the slips? List these in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1: Most common changes during growing up
Have you also experienced some of these changes? If yes, then 
it is because you are also reaching this stage gradually. This stage 
starts around 10 years of age and can continue up to the age of 
19. It is usually a stage of development between childhood and 
adulthood, and is called adolescence.
While analysing Table 6.1, you might have noticed the following:
Changes in body structure, weight gain, and 
strength
As boys grow, it might be seen that along with growing 
taller, they gain weight, their shoulders might become 
a bit broader, and their chests may get wider.
	
Girls also undergo changes in height and weight, 
and other body changes like development of breasts. 
Increase in height
From birth, our body undergoes continuous growth 
and development including an increase in height. 
However, the increase in height becomes more 
prominent during adolescence.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
76
Changes in voice
In adolescent boys, the growth of the voice box leads 
to a voice that sounds hoarse. The voice box is a 
structure in our throat that helps us to speak. The 
growth may be seen as a bump in the throat region 
and is called the Adam’s apple. However, it is not 
noticeable in every individual. The voice box also 
grows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the 
boys, leading to only slight changes in voice. 
Changes in facial skin: emergence of pimples
Another common occurrence during the adolescent 
years is a skin condition called acne, in which small, 
reddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible 
on the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily 
secretions from the skin during adolescence that can 
clog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne 
is a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it.
Appearance of hair in different parts of body
Both boys and girls experience the growth of hair in 
different parts of their bodies, such as the armpits and 
pubic region. 
	
Boys often develop facial hair, which later grows 
into a moustache and a beard as they move towards 
adulthood. Some boys may also develop chest hair and 
back hair, though few boys may have no significant 
hair growth. Variations in and timing of appearance of 
hair growth is completely normal.
A key point to remember
Whether it is a change in height, voice, or facial hair, it is 
important to recognise that the timing, nature, and extent 
of these changes vary among individuals. These variations 
are completely normal.
	
Each person experiences adolescence at his or her 
own pace, and its duration also varies from one person to 
another.
Adam's 
apple
Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change
77
Now, we have understood some of the changes that take place 
during adolescence, particularly those that are easily observable. 
Some of these characteristic changes, like change in voice, the growth 
of facial and chest hair in boys, and the development of breasts 
in girls  are not directly involved in the process of reproduction. 
However, these characteristic changes help distinguish males 
from females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual 
characteristics.
Secondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the 
body is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty. 
Puberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes 
external and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of 
reproduction. 
6.2	 Changes that Indicate Reproductive 
Capability
Adolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also 
by internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such 
change is the maturation of various parts involved in the process 
of reproduction.
Both boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and 
these changes are a natural part of the process of growing up. 
An important internal change associated with adolescent girls is 
the onset of the menstrual cycle. It recurs generally every 28–30 
days and is more commonly known as ‘the period’. Many healthy 
girls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from 
21–35 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process 
and is one of the signs of good reproductive health. The phase of 
the cycle when blood discharge occurs from the body is referred 
to as menstruation. It may last for three to seven days. Some girls 
may feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these 
days. Usually, by the age of 45–55, menstruation stops naturally, 
marking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman’s life.
Breaking myths about menstruation
There are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that 
often lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These 
beliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among 
such myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating 
girls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a 
natural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By 
encouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can 
help society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive 
health of women and contribute positively towards a healthier 
lifestyle for women.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Adolescence is not just about physical changes or changes 
associated with reproductive capability but also about emotional 
and behavioural changes. Let us discuss them!
6.3	 Emotional and Behavioural Changes 
in Adolescents
Activity 6.2: Let us list
Take a moment to think if there are any changes in your emotions 
or behaviour or that of your classmates and friends in the past 
one or two years. These changes may be exciting, confusing, or 
both.

their probable effects on behaviour and ways for positive growth 
and development.

ways for positive growth  and development
Compassion, involvement in 
social work
While discussing Table 6.2, you may have explored the 
diverse behavioural changes in adolescents. This is because 
adolescence is often marked by stronger emotions than 
childhood. These emotions might affect adolescents’ behaviour 
like taking up/joining social initiatives to support the needy and 
the disadvantaged, or developing deeper interest in new areas.
Understanding how our emotions influence our behaviour 
and actions, can help us make better choices and respond to 
situations thoughtfully.

6.4	 Making Adolescence a Joyful 
Experience
The journey of adolescence is a unique experience. Heightened 
curiosity and excitement during this stage of life give adolescents 
a new viewpoint towards almost everything around them. 
Good habits, thoughtful decisions, and small actions can have a 
powerful positive impact on the overall well-being of adolescents. 
Let us know about them!
6.4.1 Meeting nutritional needs
In Grade 6 chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, 
you learnt about the need for a healthy diet. Since adolescence is 
a period of growth and development marked by several changes 
in the body, a nutritious diet is of utmost importance.
For proper growth, and to perform 
well on the playground, we need 
proteins and carbohydrates!
Not only that, we also need 
an adequate amount of fats, 
vitamins, and minerals as well!
Activity 6.3: Let us list
Based on the locally available foods, fill Table 6.3 with the healthy 
food sources, nutrients present in them and how these nutrients 
can help our growth and development.

Adolescents, especially girls, may sometimes suffer from 
blood-related health problem(s) because of a deficiency of 
iron or vitamin B12 in the body.
	
 Find out about such health problem(s).
	
 How can we manage iron deficiency in our body?
	
 Find out about government schemes aimed to prevent 
such deficiencies.
Know a Scientist
Dorothy Hodgkin was a brilliant scientist who studied the 
structure of vitamin B12. In 1964, she became the third 
woman to win the Nobel Prize in the 
field of chemistry. Did you know that 
vitamin B12 is required for the proper 
functioning of the human body? Like 
most vitamins, it cannot be made in the 
human body and has to be obtained 
from the food we eat. Discuss the sources 
of vitamin B12 with your teacher.
6.4.2 Personal hygiene
Besides nutrition, personal hygiene is also crucially important during 
adolescence. Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits 
and the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections.
For girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation 
is essential for both comfort and health. Menstrual hygiene can 
be maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and 
reusable cloth pads designed for this purpose.
The government also attempts to provide these products free 
of charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of 
girls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure 
the availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places 
to promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move 
forward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping 
in menstrual hygiene.
It is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly  by 
wrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This 
is to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness.  
These days, biodegradable sanitary pads are also available that 
are environment-friendly.
Fig. 6.1: Sanitary pad
Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change
81
Science and Society
To support menstrual hygiene, the government has introduced 
several initiatives—
	
 Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS): Under this scheme by the 
Government of India, sanitary pads are provided free of charge 
or at a reduced price to adolescent girls in rural areas. Awareness 
programmes are also conducted to educate girls about menstrual 
hygiene and health.
	
 Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK): It aims to 
improve the overall health of adolescents, including menstrual 
health and hygiene. It encourages peer education, where older 
students help younger ones learn about these topics.
	
 Suvidha Sanitary Napkin Initiative: Under this initiative, 
biodegradable sanitary pads are provided at affordable prices 
through Jan Aushadhi Kendras. The initiative aims to improve access 
to menstrual hygiene products for women and adolescent girls.
	
 State-Level Initiatives: Various state governments have their 
own programmes, such as the ‘Shuchi Scheme’ in Karnataka 
and free sanitary napkin schemes in states like Tamil Nadu and 
Odisha. These programmes aim to distribute free sanitary pads in 
government schools.
6.4.3 Physical activities
Fig. 6.2: Physical activities for fitness
Regular exercise and physical activities are also very important 
during adolescence. Do you exercise regularly or participate in 
games and sports? What kinds of exercises do you do? These 
activities will keep your body and mind fit and healthy, build up 
your stamina and boost your mood (Fig. 6.2).
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
82
6.4.4 Balanced social life
We all live in a society and interact with each other in our day-to-day 
life. We should all be polite and respectful towards each other 
(Fig. 6.3). This helps create a favourable and safe environment.
Since adolescence is a stage of life marked by new experiences 
and emotions, we must be thoughtful and responsible while 
interacting with others — whether in person or through social 
media. This is the time adolescents may feel attracted to their 
peers, and mimic their behaviour. Today, they often interact 
with each other online.
Fig. 6.3: Collaborative learning in action
Modern technologies have made online platforms 
available for all to obtain information, make 
connections, interact, and share information with 
each other. We should use these platforms responsibly 
for the collective well-being of all. Sometimes, we, 
knowingly or unknowingly, use social media platforms 
carelessly. Seeking guidance from elders and teachers 
can help use these platforms positively.
Science and Society
Cyberbullying involves the use of digital devices such as phones, 
computers, or online platforms to harass others by sending misleading 
messages, spreading false rumours, or sharing personal information 
without consent (Fig. 6.4). However, if someone tries to bully you, it is 
important not to feel scared or helpless. Rather, handle it wisely and 
seek help from parents and teachers. 
	
Additionally, you should be cautious when uploading any picture 
online or sharing  personal information with strangers.

6.4.5 Avoiding harmful substances — learn to  
say NO
Some people, including your peers, may tempt, persuade, force or, 
create pressure on you to consume harmful substances such as 
tobacco, gutka, cigarettes, beedi, alcohol, or even life-threatening 
illegal drugs. Since adolescence is marked by curiosity and 
excitement, adolescents might get influenced by such people and try 
these substances.
These substances are not just harmful to physical and mental 
health but are also addictive. This means that once people start 
consuming them, they develop a strong urge to take them again 
and again. Over time, they start using them regularly. This is called 
substance abuse.

Using these substances can cause serious health problems, 
such as breathing difficulties, memory loss, and damage to the 
lungs (Fig. 6.5), depending on the substance. To stay healthy, it is 
important to completely avoid these substances and make healthy 
choices instead. It is important to remain firm and confident in 
your decision to say ‘NO’. 
The first step to overcoming addiction is seeking help and 
support from family and friends, and talking to trusted people, 
such as parents or teachers. Counselling and medical advice can 
also be helpful in handling such situations. Remember, your 
health and your future are in your hands — choose wisely!

Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan
The Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan was launched by the Ministry 
of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. It 
intends to reach out to the masses and spread awareness on the 
issue of avoiding substance abuse through active participation of 
the youth, women, and the community. The special focus is on the 
prevention of substance abuse among early-age children. 
The Government has launched a National De-addiction Helpline— 
14446, to deal with drug addiction and to help drug addicts.
6.5 The ‘Why’ Question for Adolescence
But I wonder why these 
changes occur at this stage 
of life!
We now understand the different 
changes in adolescence and also know 
some ways to handle it with a sense of 
responsibility.
Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and 
other signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones — certain 
chemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial 
role in regulating various aspects of growth and development, 
contributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are 
produced in different parts of the body and are released at an 
appropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some 
hormones influence mood and behaviour. 
Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change
85
By staying informed, seeking support and guidance when 
needed, and making healthy decisions, you can build a strong 
foundation for your life ahead.
In a Nutshell
	
 Adolescence is the period of change from childhood to 
adulthood. It generally begins around the age of 10 years 
and usually lasts until 19 years.
	
 Adolescence is marked by significant and characteristic 
physical, biological, and emotional changes.
	
 Features that help to distinguish the male from the female 
but are not directly involved in reproduction are called 
secondary sexual characteristics.
	
 Puberty is the stage in which the body of a child undergoes 
observable and internal changes to develop into an adult 
capable of reproduction.
	
 Adolescence in girls is also marked by start of the menstrual 
cycle, during which there is a discharge of blood generally 
after every 28–30 days, a process called menstruation. 
Menstruation begins at puberty and generally ends by the 
age of 45–55 years. 
	
 Adolescents face several emotional and behavioural changes. 
	
 Eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining good 
personal hygiene, and participating in physical activities 
help adolescents to stay healthy. 
	
 Addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, 
have adverse effects on the body and mind. It is wise to say 
‘NO’ to these substances and stay away from them. 
	
 Changes that take place in the body during adolescence are 
primarily controlled by certain chemicals produced in the 
body. These chemicals are called hormones.
	
 Proper guidance and awareness help adolescents manage 
physical, emotional, and behavioural changes effectively.

Pema and her brother Palden reside in Gangtok. On a cold winter 
evening, they are sitting around a ﬁ replace. Palden shares his 
experiences of visiting Kerala during the winter vacation. He 
says that compared to Gangtok, winter in Kerala is comparatively 
warm and humid. Both Pema and Palden are curious about why 
some places are so cold and others quite hot. 
Hearing them express their curiosity, their grandfather, a 
retired science teacher, says, “Kerala is closer to the equator than 
Sikkim and it also has a long coastline, which results in warmer 
and more humid weather conditions”. Palden replies, “Yes, we 
learnt in Grade 6 Science and Social Science that for us on the 
Earth, the Sun is the main source of heat and light, and around 
the equator, the climate is generally hot”. 
As they are talking, Pema is keenly observing her grandmother 
cooking thukpa (a traditional Sikkimese dish) in a large metal 
pan. Pema asks, “Why are cooking utensils generally made of 
metals?” Palden immediately responds that they had studied 
in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-metals’ that such 
materials are good conductors of heat.

How does heat get 
transferred in these 
materials?
Let us perform an activity to learn why certain materials are 
good conductors of heat.
7.1 Conduction of Heat

a teacher or an adult.

Take a strip of a metal, such as aluminium 
or iron, about 15 cm long. 
Attach four pins to the strip with the help 
of wax such that they are arranged at 
nearly equal distances (about 2 cm apart), 
as shown in Fig. 7.1. 
Secure the strip to a stand and label the 
pins as I, II, III, and IV, as shown in Fig. 7.1. 
(If a stand is not available, place the strip 
between two bricks for support.)
Heat the end of the strip that is away from 
the stand with a candle or a spirit lamp.

What will happen to the pins? Will they remain attached to 
the strip or will they fall?
Predict the order in which the pins will fall from the strip. 
Record your observations in Table 7.1. 
 Heat Transfer in Nature
91
You observed that the pin closest to the candle ﬂ ame (pin I) 
falls ﬁ rst, followed by pins II, III, and IV. Why does pin I fall before 
pin II? Why did all the pins not fall together? 
From your observations, what can you infer? Do you think 
that heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the 
end that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and 
approaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here, 
the transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the 
colder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of 
an object to the colder part is called conduction. In this process, 
the particle that gets heated, passes the heat on to its neighbour, 
and so on. However, the particles themselves do not move from 
their positions. 
Materials like metals that allow heat to pass through them 
easily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are 
good conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for 
cooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the 
process of conduction.
If we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place 
of a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can 
you think of the reason for this based on our learning from the 
chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-Metals’? 
Materials such as glass and wood do not 
allow heat to pass through them easily and 
are poor conductors (insulators) of heat. 
Clay and porcelain are also poor conductors 
of heat — that is why tea or coﬀ ee kept in 
such cups stays hot longer.
List some materials around you and 
classify them as good or poor conductors 
of heat in Table 7.2.

utensils for cooking, 
whereas we prefer clay

Woollen fabric traps air in its pores 
and as air is a poor conductor of heat, 
it reduces heat ﬂ ow from our bodies to 
our surroundings. As a result, we feel 
warm. Similarly, air trapped between 
the layers of clothing acts as a poor 
conductor of heat and keeps us warm. 
The presence of air between two thin 
blankets is the reason why we prefer 
them over one thick blanket to keep 
us warm (Fig. 7.2).
Is it possible to construct houses that are not aﬀ ected much 
by the outside heat and cold? Houses constructed in places with 
a very hot or cold climate often use the concept of heat transfer 
to keep them cool or warm.
FASCINATING FACTS
The upper regions of the Himalayas, such as the Mori block of Uttarkashi 
in Uttarakhand, experience an extremely cold climate and heavy 
snowfall during winters. Houses here are often built to stay warm 
during winters, with walls made of two wooden layers ﬁ lled with cow 
dung and mud between them. As wood and mud are poor conductors 
of heat, they prevent heat loss and help in keeping the houses warm.

There are houses with outer walls that are constructed using 
hollow bricks that keep them warm in winters and cool in 
summers. This happens because the air that gets trapped in the 
hollow bricks is a poor conductor of heat.

Place a burning candle below one of

Observe what happens to the cup.
Record your observations in Table 7.3 
and think of probable reasons.
Table 7.3: Recording observations and probable reasons
Observation about the cups
Probable reasons for the observation
You observed that the cup under which the candle 
was placed, rises up (Fig. 7.3b). Why is it so? The air 
around the candle ﬂ ame heats up. As the air in the 
cup warms up, it expands and occupies more space. 
As a result, it becomes lighter and rises up. 
You can experience the expansion of air on 
heating it by placing a partially inﬂ ated balloon in 
the Sun (Fig. 7.4). After the air in the balloon gets 
heated, it expands and the balloon becomes larger. 
You must have observed that when an incense 
stick (agarbatti) is burnt, smoke rises up. Smoke is a 
mixture of hot gases and tiny solid particles that are released 
when something burns. As it is warmer than the surrounding air, 
it rises up.
Let us ﬁ nd out how heat transfer 
takes place in liquids by performing 
the following activity.

7.2.1 Land and Sea Breeze
Palden shares his experience of visiting a beach in Kerala during 
winter vacation and says, “During the day, the sand or soil near 
the beach is hotter than the water in the sea. However, at night, 
the sand or soil is cooler than the water.” Pema replies, “Yes, 
diﬀ erent objects get heated and cooled diﬀ erently.” 
Let us check how land and water get heated and cooled by 
performing an activity. 
Activity 7.4: Let us investigate
Caution— This activity should be carried out on a clear, 
sunny day under the supervision of a teacher or an adult.
Take two identical bowls as shown in Fig. 7.6.
Fill one bowl halfway with soil and the other bowl 
halfway with water. 
Fix a laboratory thermometer in each bowl as 
shown in Fig. 7.6. Make sure that the bulbs of the 
thermometer are immersed in soil and water, and 
do not touch the bottoms or the sides of the bowls.
Place the set-up in sunlight.

temperature of soil and water

Observe the movement of the coloured streak in the 
water.
As you supply heat, a streak of colour starts moving 
up and then coming down from the sides (Fig. 7.5b).
Why does the streak of coloured water go up in the 
middle and come down from the sides? The water at the 
bottom of the beaker gets heated up and becomes hot. 
It expands, becomes lighter, and rises. The water on the 
sides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier, 
and comes down to take the place of the rising water. 
Then, this water gets heated and in turn also rises.
This cycle continues until the entire volume of water 
gets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets 
heated through the actual movement of water particles. 
This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It 
is because of convection that we see the movement of the 
coloured streak inside the beaker.
Thus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated 
up by the process of convection. Here, heat transfer takes 
place by the actual movement of particles of liquids and 
gases from one place to another.

Did the temperature rise by the same amount for both the 
soil and the water at the same time?
If not, which one got heated faster?
How much was the rise in temperature of the soil and the 
water in 20 minutes?
After 20 minutes, you will ﬁ nd that the temperature of the 
soil rises more than that of the water. This indicates that the soil 
heats up faster than water. 
Does the soil also cool faster than water? After letting the soil 
and water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for 
20 minutes. You will observe that 
the soil cools faster than water, 
just as it gets heated faster.
People 
living 
in 
coastal 
areas experience an interesting 
phenomenon 
caused 
by 
the 
heating and cooling of land and 
water at diﬀ erent rates. As the 
land gets heated faster than water 
during the day, it causes warm 
air above the land to rise. This 
causes cooler air to move from 
the sea towards the land. This 
movement of cooler air from the 
sea to the land is called sea breeze 
(Fig. 7.7a). Hence, in hot places, sea breeze relieves people from 
the heat. That is why, windows of the houses in coastal areas are 
placed facing the sea.

At 
night, 
the 
process 
reverses. In the absence of 
sunlight, land cools down 
faster than the water in the 
sea. As a result, the air above 
the sea is warmer and rises 
up. Cooler air from the land 
then moves towards the 
sea, creating a land breeze 
(Fig. 7.7b).
Thus, people living near 
the seashore experience that 
the direction of the wind 
reverses in the day and night. 
7.3 Radiation 
Do you remember when Pema and Palden were sitting around 
the ﬁ replace? They felt warm.
Their grandfather tells them that the 
heat transfer, in this case, takes place 
directly from the ﬁ re (hot object) to us by a 
process known as radiation. The heat of the 
Sun reaches us through this process. Heat 
transfer by radiation does not require any medium. 
All objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot 
utensil kept away from the ﬂ ame cools down after some time. 
What is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating 
heat to its surroundings.
Why is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured 
clothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during 
winters? 
Light-coloured clothes reﬂ ect most of the heat that falls on 
them, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing 
them during summers. Dark surfaces, on the other hand, 
absorb more heat, and therefore, we feel more comfortable 
with dark-coloured clothes during winters.

There are many examples in our daily life, where we can 
observe conduction, convection, and radiation happening 
together.
Consider the case of water being heated up, as 
shown in Fig. 7.8. Let us identify the various ways in 
which the pan and the water get heated up, as well 
as the warmth we feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot 
pan. Heat is transferred from the ﬂ ame to the utensil 
by conduction. Subsequently, water in the utensil 
gets heated up by convection. The warmth that we 
feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot utensil is due to 
radiation.
Let us wrap up!
From the activities, examples, and discussions so far, we ﬁ nd that 
there are three processes by which heat gets transferred. These 
are conduction, convection, and radiation. 
In conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives 
heat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so 
on. The particles themselves do not move away from their 
positions.
In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual 
movement of particles. 
Note that in conduction and convection, a medium must be 
present whose particles help in the transfer of heat. 
In the case of radiation, heat travels from one place to 
another and no material medium is required for its transfer.
FASCINATING FACTS
In the upper reaches of the Himalayan 
region, a traditional room heater locally 
known as bukhari is used to keep rooms 
warm during winters. It consists of an iron 
stove in which wood or charcoal is burnt. 
A long pipe attached to the upper part of 
the heater serves as a chimney, venting 
out the smoke. Additionally, the bukhari
can be used for cooking, as its ﬂ at top 
provides a platform for placing utensils. 
All the three processes of heat transfer 
are involved when this device is used for 
cooking and warming up the room.

You have learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that 
the Sun is the main source of heat for the Earth. You have seen 
your parents drying wet clothes on the clothesline at home. Wet 
clothes dry faster on a sunny day since the heat from the Sun 
makes the evaporation of water faster. 
Thus, heat from the Sun plays an important role in the 
evaporation of water, be it from clothes drying on a line or from 
water bodies like oceans and lakes. Let us look at the phenomenon 
of water cycle to understand this in more detail.
7.4 Water Cycle
y
You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, 
that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it ﬁ lls 
the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms 
snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar 
regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the 
Earth’s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and 
ice gets converted to water due to the Sun’s radiation and ﬂ ows 
down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is 
replenished by fresh snow during winters. 
Water in the oceans, 
rivers, and lakes gets 
heated due to the Sun, and 
as a result, it evaporates 
as water vapour. Water 
also 
evaporates 
from 
trees and plants through 
transpiration. 
When water vapour 
rises up, it cools down 
and condenses to form 
clouds. 
Clouds 
bring 
rain, snow, and hail. 
This process is called 
precipitation. 
The continuous movement of water — upward as water vapour 
and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, 
and plants, and ﬁ nally returning to water bodies, is called water 
cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and 
replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to 
conserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that 
falls on the surface of the Earth, ﬂ ows into ponds, lakes, rivers, 
and oceans or seeps into the ground.

Varahamihira was an astronomer and mathematician of the 
sixth century CE in Ujjaini (modern-day Ujjain), Madhya Pradesh. 
In his work Brihatsamhita, he gave methods for predicting seasonal 
rainfall. His predictions of seasonal rainfalls were based on factors, 
such as cloud formation, wind patterns, position of stars and the 
moon, and other natural phenomena.

Do your ﬁ ndings match with your predictions?
You may have observed that water seeps fastest through 
gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why 
is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when 
compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep 
through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps 
beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water 
seeping through soil and rocks is called inﬁ ltration. Water 
can inﬁ ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and 
rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11).
The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces 
of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface 
as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and 
rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers 
(Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or 
drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few 
metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending 
on the location.

However, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water 
requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive 
groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover 
and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited 
water inﬁ ltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. 
To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used 
to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that 
groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a 
sustainable groundwater supply.

 Heat Transfer in Nature

Since water scarcity makes life diﬃ  cult, people have 
developed diﬀ erent ways to conserve water. For example, in 
Ladakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve 
water by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Ice Stupa
During the spring season in 
Ladakh, streams often dry 
up, leading to scarcity of 
water as the heat from the 
Sun’s radiation is not enough 
to melt the snow on the 
mountains. During winters, 
water 
from 
mountain 
streams is channeled down 
through underground pipes. 
This water is then sprayed 
into the cold air. As it falls, it 
freezes due to extremely low 
temperatures. 
The ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped 
structure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13. The ice stupa 
melts slowly during spring, providing water for farming and other 
needs throughout the summer.
Fig. 7.13: Ice stupa
In a Nutshell
There are three ways in which heat is transferred from one 
place to another — conduction, convection, and radiation.
The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object 
to a colder part is called conduction. In this process, particles 
do not move from their positions.
Materials that allow heat to pass through them easily are 
called good conductors of heat.
Materials that do not allow heat to pass through them easily 
are called poor conductors (insulators) of heat.
In solids, heat is mainly transferred through the process of 
conduction. In liquids and gases, heat is transferred by the 
process of convection.

In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual

of the process of convection.
Heat from the Sun reaches the Earth through radiation.
All objects exchange heat with their surroundings through 
the process of radiation.
Processes of conduction and convection require a medium 
for heat transfer but no medium is required for the radiation 
process. 
The principles of heat transfer are utilised in designing 
houses and clothing.
The continuous movement of water — upward as water 
vapour and downward through precipitation, passing 
through soil, rocks and plants, and ﬁ nally returning to water 
bodies, is called water cycle. 
The process of surface water seeping through soil and rocks 
is called inﬁ ltration.
Groundwater is the water that seeps through and gets stored 
in the pore spaces of sediments and the openings in rocks 
beneath the surface.
The underground layers of sediments and rocks that store 
water in pore spaces are called aquifers.

INTERSECTING

A triangle is the most basic closed shape. As we know, it consists of:
•	 	three corner points, that we call the vertex of the triangle, and 
•	 	three line segments or the sides of the triangle that join the pairs 
of vertices.
Triangles come in various shapes. Some of them are shown below.

Observe the symbol used to denote a triangle and how the triangles 
are named using their vertices. While naming a triangle, the vertices 
can come in any order.
The three sides meeting at the corners give rise to three angles that 
we call the angles of the triangle. For example, in ∆ABC, these angles 
are ∠CAB, ∠ABC, ∠BCA, which we simply denote as ∠A, ∠B and ∠C, 
respectively.
What happens when the three vertices lie on a straight line?
7.1 Equilateral Triangles
Among all the triangles, the equilateral triangles are the most symmetric 
ones. These are triangles in which all the sides are of equal lengths. Let 
us try constructing them.
Construct a triangle in which all the sides are of length 4 cm.
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
How did you construct this triangle and what tools did you use? Can 
this construction be done only using a marked ruler (and a pencil)?
Constructing this triangle using just a ruler is certainly possible. But 
this might require several trials. Say we draw the base — let us call it 
AB — of length 4 cm (see the figure below), and mark the third point C 
using a ruler such that AC = 4 cm. This may not lead to BC also having 
a length of 4 cm. If this happens, we will have to keep making attempts 
to mark C till we get BC to be 4 cm long.

How do we make this construction more efficient?
Recall solving a similar problem in the previous year using a compass 
(in the Chapter ‘Playing with Constructions’). We had to mark the top 
point of a ‘house’ which is 5 cm from two other points. The method we 
used to get that point can also be used here.
After constructing AB = 4 cm, we can do the following.
Step 1: Using a compass, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 4 cm 
from A, as shown in the figure. The point C is somewhere on this arc. 
How do we mark it?

7.2 Constructing a Triangle When its Sides are 
Given
How do we construct triangles that are not equilateral?
Construct a triangle of sidelength 4 cm, 5 cm and 6 cm.
As in the previous case, this triangle can also be constructed using 
just a marked ruler. But it will involve several trials.
148
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
How do we construct this triangle more efficiently?
Choose one of the given lengths to be the base of the triangle: say 4 
cm. Draw the base. Let A and B be the base vertices, and call the third 
vertex C. Let AC = 5 cm and BC = 6 cm.
Fig. 7.1
Like we did in the case of equilateral triangles, let us first get all the 
points that are at a 5 cm distance from A. These points lie on the circle 
whose centre is A and has radius 5 cm. The point C must lie somewhere 
on this circle. How do we find it?

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
The required point C is one of the points of intersection of the two 
circles.
The reason why the point of 
intersection is the third vertex is the 
same as for equilateral triangles. This 
point lies on both the circles. Hence 
its distance from A is the radius of 
the circle centred at A (5 cm) and its 
distance from B is the same as the 
radius of the circle centred at B (6 cm).
Let us summarise the steps of 
construction, noting that constructing 
full circles is not necessary to get the 
third vertex (see Fig. 7.2 and 7.3).
Step 1: Construct the base AB with one of the side lengths. Let us choose 
AB = 4 cm (see Fig. 7.1).
Step 2: From A, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 5 cm  
(see Fig. 7.2).
Step 3: From B, construct an arc of radius 6 cm such that it intersects 
the first arc (see Fig. 7.3).
Step 4: The point where both the arcs meet is the required third 
vertex C. Join AC and BC to get ∆ABC.
Construct
Construct triangles having the following sidelengths (all the units are 
in cm):
(a)	 	4, 4, 6
(b)	 	3, 4, 5
(c)	 	1, 5, 5
(d)	 	4, 6, 8

We have seen that triangles having all three equal sides are called 
equilateral triangles. Those having two equal sides are called isosceles 
triangles.

Are Triangles Possible for any Lengths?
Can one construct triangles having any given sidelengths? Are there 
lengths for which it is impossible to construct a triangle? Let us explore 
this.
Construct a triangle with sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm.
What is happening? Are you able to construct the triangle?
Here is another set of lengths: 2 cm, 3 cm, and 6 cm. Check if a triangle 
is possible for these sidelengths.
Try to find more sets of lengths for which a triangle construction 
is impossible. See if you can find any pattern in them.
We see that a triangle is possible for some sets of lengths and 
not possible for others. How do we check if a triangle exists for a given 
set of lengths? One way is to actually try to construct the triangle and 
check if it is possible. Is there a more efficient way to check this?
Triangle Inequality
Consider the lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm. Does there exist a triangle 
having these as sidelengths?
To tackle this question, let us study a property of triangles. Imagine 
a small plot of plain land having a tent, a tree, and a pole. Imagine 
you are at the entrance of the tent and want to go to the tree. Which is 
the shorter path: (i) the straight-line path to the tree (the red path) or  
(ii) the straight-line path from the tent to the pole, followed by the 
straight-line path from the pole to the tree (the yellow path)?
Math 
Talk
151
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Clearly, the direct straight-line path from the tent to the tree is shorter 
than the roundabout path via the pole. In fact, the direct straight-line 
path is the shortest possible path to the tree from the tent.
Will the direct path between any two points be shorter than the 
roundabout path via a third point? Clearly, the answer is yes. 
Can this understanding be used to tell something about the existence 
of a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm?
Let us suppose that there is a triangle for this set of lengths. Remember 
that at this point we are not sure about the existence of the triangle but 
we are only supposing that it exists. Let us draw a rough diagram.
Fig. 7.4
152
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
Does everything look right with this triangle?
If this triangle were possible, then the direct path between any two 
vertices should be shorter than the roundabout path via the third 
vertex. Is this true for our rough diagram?
Let us consider the paths between B and C.
Direct path length = BC = 10 cm
What is the length of the roundabout path via the vertex A? It is the 
sum of the lengths of line segments BA and AC.
Roundabout path length = BA + AC = 15 cm + 30 cm = 45 cm
Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes.
Let us now consider the paths between A and B.
Direct path length = AB = 15 cm
Finding the length of the roundabout path via the vertex C, we get 
Roundabout path length = AC + CB = 30 cm + 10 cm = 40 cm
Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes.
Finally, consider paths between C and A.
Direct path length = CA = 30 cm
Roundabout path length = CB + BA = 10 cm + 15 cm = 25 cm
Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? In 
this case, the direct path is longer, which is absurd. Can such a triangle 
exist? No.
Therefore, a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm 
cannot exist.
We are thus able to see without construction why a triangle for the 
set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm cannot exist. We have been able 
to figure this out through spatial intuition and reasoning. 
Recall how we used similar intuition and reasoning to discover 
properties of intersecting and parallel lines. We will continue to do 
this as we explore geometry.
Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle having sidelengths 
3 cm, 3 cm and 7 cm? Verify your answer by construction.
“In the rough diagram in Fig. 7.4, is it possible to assign 
lengths in a different order such that the direct paths are 
always coming out to be shorter than the roundabout 
paths? If this is possible, then a triangle might exist.”
Is such rearrangement of lengths possible in the triangle?

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Figure it Out
1.	 We checked by construction that there are no triangles having 
sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm and 8 cm; and 2 cm, 3 cm and 6 cm. Check if 
you could have found this without trying to construct the triangle.
2.	 Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle for each of 
the following sets of lengths?
(a)	 	10 km, 10 km and 25 km
(b)	 	5 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm
(c)	 	12 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm
You would have realised that using a rough figure and comparing 
the direct path lengths with their corresponding roundabout path 
lengths is the same as comparing each length with the sum of the other 
two lengths. There are three such comparisons to be made.
3.	 For  each set of lengths seen so far, you might have noticed that 
	
in at least two of the comparisons, the direct length was less 
than the sum of the other two (if not, check again!). For example, 
for the set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm, there are two  
comparisons where this happens:
10 < 15 + 30
15 < 10 + 30
But this doesn’t happen for the third length: 30 > 10 + 15.
Will this always happen? That is, for any set of lengths, will there be at 
least two comparisons where the direct length is less than the sum of 
the other two? Explore for different sets of lengths.
Further, for a given set of lengths, is it possible to identify which 
lengths will immediately be less than the sum of the other two, without 
calculations? 
[Hint: Consider the direct lengths in the increasing order.]
Given three sidelengths, what do we need to compare to check for the 
existence of a triangle?
When each length is smaller than the sum of the other two, we say 
that the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. For example, the set 3, 
4, 5 satisfies the triangle inequality whereas, the set 10, 15, 30 does not 
satisfy the triangle inequality.
We have seen that lengths such as 10, 15, 30 that do not satisfy the 
triangle inequality cannot be the sidelengths of a triangle.
Try
This
154
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
Does a triangle exist with sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm?
This satisfies the triangle inequality:
8 < 4 + 5 = 9
Why do we not need to check the other two sides?
This means that all the direct path lengths are less than the 
roundabout path lengths. Does this confirm the existence of a triangle? 
If one of the direct path lengths had been longer, we could have 
concluded that a triangle would surely not exist. But in this case, we 
can only say that a triangle may or may not exist.
For the triangle to exist, the arcs that we construct to get the third 
vertex must intersect. Is it possible to determine that this will happen 
without actually carrying out the construction?
Visualising the construction of circles
Let us imagine that we start the construction by constructing the 
longest side as the base. Let AB be the base of length 8 cm. The next 
step is the construction of sufficiently long arcs corresponding to the 
other two lengths: 4 cm and 5 cm.
Instead of just constructing the arcs, let us complete the full circles. 
Suppose, we construct a circle of radius 4 cm with A as the centre.
Now, suppose that a circle of radius 5 cm is constructed, centred at B. 
Can you draw a rough diagram of the resulting figure?
Note that in the figure below, AX = 4 cm and AB = 8 cm. So, what is 
BX? Does this length help in visualising the resulting figure?
155
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Since BX = 4 cm, and the radius of the circle centred at B is 5 cm, it is 
clear that the circles will intersect each other at two points.
Fig. 7.5: Circles intersecting each other at two points
What does this tell us about the existence of a triangle? The points 
A and B along with either of the points of intersection of the circles 
will give us the required triangle. Thus, there exists a triangle having 
sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm.
Figure it Out
1.	 Which of the following lengths can be the sidelengths of a triangle? 
Explain your answers. Note that for each set, the three lengths have 
the same unit of measure. 
(a)	 2, 2, 5	
(b)	 3, 4, 6
(c)	 2, 4, 8	
(d)	 5, 5, 8
(e)	 10, 20, 25	
(f)	
10, 20, 35
(g)	 24, 26, 28
We observe from the previous problems that whenever there is 
a set of lengths satisfying the triangle inequality (each length < 
sum of the other two lengths), there is a triangle with those three 
lengths as sidelengths.
Will triangles always exist when a set of lengths satisfies the triangle 
inequality? How can we be sure?
156
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
We can be sure of the existence of a triangle only if we can show that 
the circles intersect internally (as in Fig. 7.5) whenever the triangle 
inequality is satisfied. But are there other possibilities when the two 
circles are constructed? Let us visualise and study them.
The following different cases can be conceived:
A
B
Case 1: Circles touch each other
A
B
Case 2: Circles do not intersect
A
B
Case 3: Circles intersect each other internally
Note that while constructing the circles, we take
(a)	
the length of the base AB = longest of the given length
(b)	 the radii of the circles to be the smaller two lengths.
Which of the above-mentioned cases will lead to the formation of a 
triangle? Clearly, triangles are formed only when the circles intersect 
each other internally (Case 3).
Let us study each of these cases by finding the relation between the 
radii (the smaller two lengths) and AB (longest length).
Case 1: Circles touch each other at a point
For this case to happen,
sum of the two radii = AB
or 
sum of the two smaller lengths = longest length

Case 2: Circles do not intersect internally

Case 3: Circles intersect each other

158
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
AB is composed of one radius and a part of the other. So, 
sum of the two radii > AB,
or 
sum of the two smaller lengths > longest length
Can we use this analysis to tell if a triangle exists when the lengths 
satisfy the triangle inequality?
If the given lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, then the sum of 
the two smaller lengths is greater than the longest length. This means 
that this will lead to Case 3 where the circles intersect internally, and 
so a triangle exists.
How will the two circles turn out for a set of lengths that do not satisfy 
the triangle inequality? Find 3 examples of sets of lengths for which 
the circles: 
(a)	
touch each other at a point,
(b)	 do not intersect.
Frame a complete procedure that can be used to check the existence of 
a triangle.
Conclusion
If a given set of three lengths satisfies the triangle inequality, then a 
triangle exists having those as sidelengths. If the set does not satisfy the 
triangle inequality, then a triangle with those sidelengths does not exist.

See if you can describe all possible lengths of the third 
side in each case, so that a triangle exists with those sidelengths. 
For example, in case (a), all numbers strictly between 99 and 
101 would be possible.
7.3 Construction of Triangles When Some Sides 
and Angles are Given
We have seen how to construct triangles when their sidelengths are 
given. Now, we will take up constructions where in place of some 
sidelengths, angle measures are given. 
Two Sides and the Included Angle  
How do we construct a triangle if two sides and the angle included

Do triangles always exist?
Do triangles exist for every combination of two angles and their 
included side? Explore.
As in the case when we are given all three sides, it turns out that 
there is not always a triangle for every combination of two angles and 
the included side.
Find examples of measurements of two angles with the included side 
where a triangle is not possible.
Let us try to visualise such a situation. Once the base is drawn, try to 
imagine how the other sides should be so that they do not meet.
Here are some obvious examples.
If the two angles are greater than or equal to a right angle (90°), then 
it is clear that a triangle is not possible. 
Now we make one of the base angles an acute angle, say 40°. What 
are the possible values that the other angle should take so that the lines 
don’t meet?

It is clear that if the line from B is “inclined” sufficiently to the right,

to happen.

The blue line is the line with the least rightward bend that doesn’t 
meet the line ‘l’
Visually, it is clear that the line that creates the smallest ∠B has to be 
the one parallel to l. Let us call this parallel line m. 
Can you tell the actual value of ∠B be in this case? 
[Hint: Note that AB is the transversal.]
We have seen that when two lines are parallel, the internal angles 
on the same side of the transversal add up to 180°. So ∠B = 140°.
So, for what values of ∠B, does a triangle not exist? Does the length 
AB play any part here?
From the discussion above, it can be seen that the length AB does not 
play any part in deciding the existence of a triangle. We can say that a 
triangle does not exist when ∠B is greater than or equal to 140°.

1.	 	For each of the following angles, find another angle for which a 
triangle is (a) possible, (b) not possible. Find at least two different 
angles for each category:

(b)	 	70°, 30°
(c)	 	90°, 85°
(d)	 	50°, 150°
Like the triangle inequality, can you form a rule that describes the two 
angles for which a triangle is possible?
Can the sum of the two angles be used for framing this rule?
163
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
When the sum of two given angles is less than 180°, a triangle exists 
with these angles. If the sum is greater than or equal to 180°, there is 
no triangle with these angles.
Let us take two angles, say 60° and 70°, whose sum is less than 180°. 
Let the included side be 5 cm.
What could the measure of the third angle be? Does this measure 
change if the base length is changed to some other value, say 7 cm? 
Construct and find out.
In general, once the two angles are fixed, does the third angle depend 
on the included sidelength? Try with different pairs of angles and 
lengths.
The measurements might show that the sidelength has no effect (or 
a very small effect) on the third angle. With this observation, let us see 
if we can find the third angle without carrying out the construction 
and measurement.
Try experimenting with different triangles to see if there is a 
relation between any two angles and the third one. To find this 
relation, what data will you keep track of and how will you 
organise the data you collect?
Consider a triangle ABC with ∠B= 50° and ∠C= 70°. Let us see how we 
can find ∠A without construction.

We saw that the notion of parallel lines was useful to determine that 
the sum of any two angles of a triangle is 
less than 180°. Parallel lines can be used to 
find the third angle, ∠BAC as well.
Let us suppose we construct a line XY 
parallel to BC through vertex A.
We can see new angles being formed here: 
∠XAB, and ∠YAC. What are their values?
Since the line XY is parallel to BC, 
∠XAB = ∠B and ∠YAC = ∠C, because they are alternate angles of the 
transversals AB and AC.

Therefore, ∠XAB = 50°, and ∠YAC = 70°. Can we find ∠BAC from this?
We know that ∠XAB, ∠YAC and ∠BAC together form 180°. So
∠XAB + ∠YAC + ∠BAC = 180°
50° + ∠BAC + 70° = 180°
120° + ∠BAC = 180°
Thus, ∠BAC = 60°
Now construct a triangle (taking BC to be of any suitable length) and 
verify if this is indeed the case.

We need to find ∠A + ∠B + ∠C.
We know that ∠B	 = ∠XAB, ∠C = ∠YAC.
So, ∠A + ∠B + ∠C	 = ∠A + ∠XAB + ∠YAC

Thus we have proved that the sum of the three angles in any triangle 
is 180°! This rather surprising result is called the angle sum property 
of triangles.

Take some time to reflect upon how we figured out the angle sum 
property. In the beginning, the relationship between the third angle 
and the other two angles was not at all clear. However, a simple idea of 
drawing a line parallel to the base through the top vertex (as in Fig.  7.7) 
suddenly made the relationship obvious. This ingenious idea can be 
found in a very influential book in the history of mathematics called 
‘The Elements’. This book is attributed to the Greek mathematician 
Euclid, who lived around 300 BCE.
This solution is yet another example of how creative thinking plays 
a key role in mathematics!
There is a convenient way of verifying the angle sum property by 
folding a triangular cut-out of a paper. Do you see how this shows that 
the sum of the angles in this triangle is 180°?

Exterior Angles
The angle formed between the extension of a side of a triangle and 
the other side is called an exterior angle of the triangle. In this figure, 
∠ACD is an exterior angle.

Exterior Angle
Find ∠ACD, if ∠A = 50°, and ∠B = 60°.
From the angle sum property, we know that 
50° + 60° + ∠ACB = 180°
110° + ∠ACB = 180°
So, ∠ACB = 70°
So, ∠ACD = 180 ° – 70° = 110°, 
since, ∠ACB and ∠ACD together form a straight angle. 
Find the exterior angle for different measures of ∠A and ∠B. Do you 
see any relation between the exterior angle and these two angles?
[Hint: From angle sum property, we have ∠A + ∠B + ∠ACB = 180°.]
We also have ∠ACD + ∠ACB = 180°, since they form a straight angle. 
What does this show?
7.4 Constructions Related to Altitudes of Triangles
There is another set of useful measurements with respect to a triangle —  
the height of each of its vertices with respect to the opposite sides.
In the world around us, we talk of the 
heights of various objects: the height of a 
person, the height of a tree, the height of 
a building, etc. What do we mean by the 
word ‘height’?
Consider a triangle ABC. What is the 
height of the vertex A from its opposite 
side BC, and how can it be measured?
Let AD be the line segment from A drawn perpendicular to BC. The 
length of AD is the height of the vertex A from BC. The line segment AD 
is said to be one of the ‘altitudes’ of the triangle. The other altitudes

are BE and CF in the figure below: the perpendiculars drawn from the 
other vertices to their respective opposite sides.

Whenever we use the word height of the triangle, we generally 
refer to the length of the altitude to whatever side we take as base (this 
altitude is AD in the case of Fig. 7.8).
What would the altitude from A to BC be in this triangle?

We extend BC and then drop the perpendicular from A to this line.
Altitudes Using Paper Folding
Cut out a paper triangle. Fix one of the sides as the base. Fold it in 
such a way that the resulting crease is an altitude from the top vertex 
to the base. Justify why the crease formed should be perpendicular to 
the base.
Construction of the Altitudes of a Triangle
Construct an arbitrary triangle. Label the vertices A, B, C taking BC to 
be the base. 
Construct the altitude from A to BC, 
Constructing the altitude using just a ruler is not accurate. To get a 
more precise angle of 90°, we use a set square along with a ruler.
Can you see how to do this?

Step 1: Keep the ruler aligned to the base. Place the set square on the 
ruler as shown, such that one of the edges of the right angle touches 
the ruler.

Does there exist a triangle in which a side is also an altitude?
Visualise such a triangle and draw a rough diagram.

right angle. 
Triangles having one right angle are called right-angled triangles 
or simply right triangles.

7.5 Types of Triangles
In our study of triangles, we have encountered the following types of 
triangles; equilateral, isosceles, scalene and right-angled triangles. 
Did you spot any other type of triangle?
The classification of triangles as equilateral and isosceles was based 
on equality of sides. 
Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles 
have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three 
different lengths. 
Can a similar classification be done based on equality of angles? Is 
there any relation between these two classifications? We will answer 
these questions in a later chapter.
We used angle measures when classifying a triangle as a right-
angled triangle. 
What are the other types of triangles based on angle measures?
A classification of triangles based on their angle measures is acute-
angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles. We have already 
seen what a right-angled triangle is. It is a triangle with one right angle. 
Similarly, an obtuse-angled triangle has one obtuse angle. 
What could an acute-angled triangle be? Can we define it as a  
triangle with one acute angle? Why not? 
In an acute-angled triangle, all three angles are acute angles.

[Hint: Note that the other measurements can take any values. Take 
AC as the base. What values can ∠A and ∠C take so that the other 
angle is 90°?]
4.	 Through construction, explore if it is possible to construct an 
equilateral triangle that is (i) right-angled (ii) obtuse-angled. 
Also construct an isosceles triangle that is (i) right-angled  
(ii) obtuse-angled.
•	 Use of a compass simplifies the construction of triangles when the 
sidelengths are given.
•	 A set of three lengths where the length of each is smaller than the 
sum of the other two is said to satisfy the triangle inequality.
•	 Sidelengths of a triangle satisfy triangle inequality, and, if a given set 
of lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, a triangle can be constructed 
with those sidelengths.
•	 Triangles can be constructed when the following measurements are 
given:
(a)	
two of the sides and their included angle
(b)	 two angles and the included side
•	 The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180°.
•	 An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a 
vertex to its opposite side.
•	 Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles 
have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three 
different lengths. 
•	 Triangles are classified based on their angle measures as  
acute-angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles.

2.1 Simple Expressions
You may have seen mathematical phrases like 13 + 2, 20 – 4, 12 × 5, and 
18 ÷ 3. Such phrases are called arithmetic expressions. 
Every arithmetic expression has a value which is the number it 
evaluates to. For example, the value of the expression 13 + 2 is 15. This 
expression can be read as ‘13 plus 2’ or ‘the sum of 13 and 2’.
We use the equality sign ‘=’ to denote the relationship between an 
arithmetic expression and its value. For example:
13 + 2 = 15.
Example 1: Mallika spends ₹25 every day for lunch at school. Write 
the expression for the total amount she spends on lunch in a week 
from Monday to Friday.
The expression for the total amount is 5 × 25.
5 × 25 is  “5 times 25” or “the product of 5 and 25”. 
Different expressions can have the same value. Here are multiple 
ways to express the number 12, using two numbers and any of the four 
operations +, – ,  × and ÷:
10 + 2, 15 – 3, 3 × 4, 24 ÷ 2.
Choose your favourite number and write as many expressions as you 
can having that value.
Comparing Expressions
As we compare numbers using ‘=’, ‘<’ and ‘>’ signs, we can also compare 
expressions. We compare expressions based on their values and write 
the ‘equal to’, ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ sign accordingly. For example, 
10 + 2 > 7 + 1

marbles. Joy had 1022 marbles and got 128 
more today. Now he has 1022 + 128 marbles.  Who 
has more?
This situation can be represented as shown in 
the picture on the right. To begin with, Raja had 1 
more marble than Joy. But Joy got 3 more marbles 
than Raja today. We can see that Joy has (two) 
more marbles than Raja now.

25 of them. He has 113 – 25 marbles. Joy had 112 
marbles and lost 24 today. He has 112 – 24 marbles. 
Who has more marbles left with them?
Raja had 1 marble more than Joy. But he also 
lost 1 marble more than Joy did. Therefore, they 
have an equal number of marbles now.

2.2 Reading and Evaluating Complex Expressions 
Sometimes, when an expression is not accompanied by a context, there 
can be more than one way of evaluating its value. In such cases, we 
need some tools and rules to specify how exactly the expression has to 
be evaluated. 
To give an example with language, look 
at the following sentences:   
(a)	 Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a 
friend with toys”.  
	
Meaning: The friend has toys and 
Shalini sat next to her.
(b)   Sentence:   “Shalini sat next to a 
friend, with toys”. 
	
Meaning: Shalini has the toys 
and she sat with them next to her 
friend. 
This sentence without the punctuation could have been interpreted 
in two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how 
the sentence has to be understood.
Let us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way.
Example 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun 
brought 5 bags of marbles with 4 marbles in each bag. How many 
marbles did Mallesh and Arun bring to the playground?
Mallesh summarized this by writing the mathematical expression —
30 + 5 × 4.
Arithmetic Expressions
27
Without knowing the context behind this expression, Purna found 
the value of this expression to be 140. He added 30 and 5 first, to get 35, 
and then multiplied 35 by 4 to get 140.
Mallesh found the value of this expression to be 50. He multiplied 5 
and 4 first to get 20 and added 20 to 30 to get 50. 
In this case, Mallesh is right. But why did Purna get it wrong? 
Just looking at the expression 30 + 5 × 4, it is not clear whether we 
should do the addition first or multiplication. 
Just as punctuation marks are used to resolve confusions in language, 
brackets and the notion of terms are used in mathematics to resolve 
confusions in evaluating expressions.
Brackets in Expressions
In the expression to find the number of marbles — 30 + 5 × 4 — we had 
to first multiply 5 and 4, and then add this product to 30. This order of 
operations is clarified by the use of brackets as follows:
30 + (5 × 4).
When evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find 
the values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing 
other operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value 
of 5 × 4, and then do the addition. Thus, this expression describes the 
number of marbles:
30 + (5 × 4 ) = 30 + 20 = 50.
Example 5: Irfan bought a pack of biscuits for ₹15 and a packet of toor 
dal for ₹56. He gave the shopkeeper ₹100. Write an expression that can 
help us calculate the change Irfan will get back from the shopkeeper.
Irfan spent ₹15 on a biscuit packet and ₹56 on toor dal. So, the total 
cost in rupees is 15 + 56. He gave ₹100 to the shopkeeper. So, he should 
get back 100 minus the total cost. Can we write that expression as—
100 – 15 + 56 ? 
Can we first subtract 15 from 100 and then add 56 to the result? We 
will get 141. It is absurd that he gets more money than he paid the 
shopkeeper!
We can use brackets in this case:
100 – (15 + 56).
Evaluating the expression within the brackets first, we get 100 minus 
71, which is 29. So, Irfan will get back ₹29.

Terms in Expressions
Suppose we have the expression 30 + 5 × 4 without any brackets. Does 
it have no meaning? 
When there are expressions having multiple operations, and the 
order of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion 
of terms to determine the order.
Terms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For 
example, in 12+7, the terms are 12 and 7, as marked below.
12
7
+
12 + 7 =
We will keep marking each term of an expression as above. Note 
that this way of marking the terms is not a usual practice. This will be 
done until you become familiar with this concept.
Now, what are the terms in 83 – 14? We know that subtracting a 
number is the same as adding the inverse of the number. Recall that 
the inverse of a given number has the sign opposite to it. For example, 
the inverse of 14 is –14, and the inverse of –14 is 14. Thus, subtracting 
14 from 83 is the same as adding –14 to 83. That is,
83
– 14
+
83 – 14 =
 
Thus, the terms of the expression 83 – 14 are 83 and –14. 
Check if replacing subtraction by addition in this way does not change 
the value of the expression, by taking different examples.
Can you explain why subtracting a number is the same as adding its 
inverse, using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 
6 textbook of mathematics? 
All subtractions in an expression are converted to additions in this 
manner to identify the terms.
Here are some more examples of expressions and their terms:

Now we will see how terms are used to determine the order of 
operations to find the value of an expression. 
We will start with expressions having only additions (with all the 
subtractions suitably converted into additions).
Does changing the order in which the terms are added give different 
values?
Swapping and Grouping
Let us consider a simple expression having only two terms.
Example 6: Madhu is flying a drone from a terrace. The drone goes 6 m 
up and then 4 m down. Write an expression to show how high the final 
position of the drone is from the terrace.
The drone is 6 – 4 = 2 m above the terrace. Writing it as sum of terms:
6
– 4

=
Will the sum change if we swap the terms?
– 4

It doesn’t in this case.
We already know that swapping the terms does not change the sum 
when both the terms are positive numbers.
Will this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as 
well? Take some more expressions and check.

Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of  
integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? 
Thus, in an expression having two terms, swapping them does not 
change the value.

Now consider an expression having three terms: (–7) + 10 + (–11). Let 
us add these terms in the following two different orders:
– 7
 10
+
– 11
+
(adding the first two terms and then adding their sum to the third 
term)
– 7
 10
+
– 11
+
(adding the last two terms and then adding their sum to the first 
term)
What do you see? The sums are the same in both cases.
Again, we know that while adding positive numbers, grouping them 
in any of the above two ways gives the same sum. 
Will this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as 
well? Take some more expressions and check. 
Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of 
integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? 
Thus, grouping the terms of an expression in either of the following 
ways gives the same value.
Term 1

Let us consider the expression (–7) + 10 + (–11) again. What happens 
when we change the order and add –7 and –11 first, and then add this 
sum to 10? Will we get the same sum as before?
We see that adding the terms of the expression (–7) + 10 + (–11) in 
any order gives the same sum of –8.

Does adding the terms of an expression in any order give the same 
value? Take some more expressions and check. Consider expressions 
with more than 3 terms also. 
Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of   
integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? 
Thus, the addition of terms in any order gives the same value.
Therefore, in an expression having only additions, it does not matter 
in what order the terms are added: they all give the same value.
Now let us consider expressions having multiplication and division 
also, without the order of operations specified by the brackets. The 
values of such expressions are found by first evaluating the terms. 
Once all the terms are evaluated, they are added. 
For example, the expression 30 + 5 × 4 is evaluated as follows:
30
30
5 × 4
20
+
+
30 + 5 × 4 =
50

The expression 5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 is evaluated as follows:
5 × (3 + 2)
3
+
5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 =
+
7 × 8
Where (3+2) is first evaluated and this sum is multiplied by 5 (= 25). 
The expression 7 × 8 is evaluated (= 56). This simplifies to 25 + 56 + 3 = 
84.
Manasa is adding a long list of numbers. It took her five 
minutes to add them all and she got the answer 11749. Then 
she realised that she had forgotten to include the fourth 
number 9055. Does she have to start all over again?
In mathematics we use the phrase commutative property 
of addition instead of saying “swapping terms does not 
change the sum”. Similarly, “grouping does not change the sum” is 
called the associative property of addition.
Swapping the Order of Things in Everyday Life 
Manasa is going outside to play. Her mother says, “Wear 
your hat and shoes!” Which one should she 
wear first?  She can wear her hat first and then 
her shoes. Or she can wear her shoes first and

Example 7: Amu, Charan, Madhu, and John went to a hotel and ordered 
four dosas. Each dosa cost ₹23, and they wish to thank the waiter by 
tipping ₹5. Write an expression describing the total cost.
Cost of 4 dosas = 4 × 23

Removing Brackets — I
Let us find the value of this expression,
200 – (40 + 3).
We first evaluate the expression inside the 
bracket to 43 and then subtract it from 200. 
But it is simpler to first subtract 40 from 200:
200 – 40 = 160.
And then subtract 3 from 160:
160 – 3 = 157.
What we did here was 200 – 40 – 3. Notice, that we did not do 
200 – 40 + 3.
So,
200 – (40 + 3) = 200 – 40 – 3.
Example 12: We also saw this earlier in the case of Irfan purchasing a 
biscuit packet (₹15) and a toor dal packet (₹56). When he paid ₹100, the 
change he gets in rupees is: 
100 – (15 + 56) = 29.
The change could also have been calculated as follows: 
(a)	 First subtract the cost of the biscuit packet (15) from 100: 
100 – 15 = 85.
	
This is the amount the shopkeeper owes Irfan if he had 
purchased only the biscuits. As he has purchased toor dal 
also, its cost is taken from this remaining amount of 85. 
(b)	 So, to find the change, we need to subtract the cost of toor 
dal from 85.
85 – 56 = 29.
	
What we have done here is 100 – 15 – 56. So,
100 – (15 + 56) = 100 – 15 – 56.
Notice how upon removing the brackets preceded by a negative 
sign, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. Observe

the signs of 40 and 3 in the first example, and that of 15 and 56 in 
the second.
Example 13: Consider the expression 500 – (250 – 100). Is it possible to 
write this expression without the brackets?
To evaluate this expression, we need to subtract 250 – 100 = 150 
from 500:
500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 150 = 350.
If we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have 
subtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back 
that 100 to 500 – 250 to make the expression take the same value as 500 
– (250 – 100). This sequence of operations is 500 – 250+100. Thus,
500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 250 + 100.
Check that 500 – (250 – 100) is not equal to 500 – 250 – 100.
Notice again that when the brackets preceded by a negative sign 
are removed,  the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. In this 
case, the signs of 250 and – 100 change to – 250 and 100.
Example 14: Hira has a rare coin collection. She has 28 coins in one bag 
and 35 coins in another. She gifts her friend 10 coins from the second 
bag. Write an expression for the number of coins left with Hira.
This can be expressed by 28 + (35 – 10). 
We know that this is the same as 28 + (35 + (–10)). Since the terms 
can be added in any order, this expression can simply be written as  
28 + 35 + (–10), or 28 + 35 – 10. Thus, 
28 + (35 – 10) = 28 + 35 – 10 = 53.
When the brackets are NOT preceded by a negative sign, the terms 
within them do not change their signs upon removing the brackets. 
Notice the sign of the terms 35 and – 10 in the above expression.
Rather than simply remembering rules for when to change the sign and 
when not to, you can figure it out for yourself by thinking about the 
meanings of the expressions.

This expression means 24 more than 
2 × 43. But, we want an expression 
which means twice or double of 43 + 24.
We can make use of brackets to write 
such an expression: 
2 × (43 + 24).
So, we can say that together they have 
to pay 2 × (43 + 24). This is also the same 
as paying for two vegetable cutlets and 
two rasgullas: 
2 × 43 + 2 × 24.
Therefore, 
2 × (43 + 24) = 2 × 43 + 2 × 24.

Example 16: In the Republic Day parade, there are boy scouts and girl 
guides marching together. The scouts march in 4 rows with 5 scouts in 
each row. The guides march in 3 rows with 5 guides in each row (see 
the figure below). How many scouts and guides are marching in this 
parade?
The number of boy scouts marching is 4 × 5. The number of girl 
guides marching is 3 × 5.
The total number of 
scouts and guides will be 
4 × 5 + 3 × 5.
This can also be found 
by first finding the total 
number of rows, i.e., 4 + 
3, and then multiplying 
their sum by the number 
of children in each row. 
Thus, the number of boys

Is 5 × (4 + 3) = 5 × (3 + 4) = (3 + 4) × 5?
The observations that we have made in the previous two examples 
can be seen in a general way as follows. 
Consider 10 × 98 + 3 × 98. This means taking the sum of 10 times 98 
and 3 times 98.
98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98  +  98 + 98 + 98 
10 times
3 times
Clearly, this is the same as 10 + 3 = 13 times 98. Thus, 
10 × 98 +3 × 98 = (10 + 3) × 98.
Writing this equality the other way, we get
(10 + 3) 98 = 10 × 98 + 3 × 98.
Swapping the numbers in the products above, this property can be 
seen in the following form:
98 × 10 + 9 × 83 = 98 (10 + 3), and
98 (10 + 3) = 98 × 10 + 98 × 3.
Similarly, let us consider the expression 14 × 10 – 6 × 10. This means 
subtracting 6 times 10 from 14 times 10.
10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10
14 times
Clearly, this is 14 – 6 = 8 times 10. Thus,
14 × 10 – 6 × 10 =  (14 – 6) × 10, 
or
(14 – 6) × 10 = 14 × 10 – 6 × 10
This property can be nicely summed up as follows:
The multiple of a sum (difference) is the same as the sum (difference) 
of the multiples.

•	 To help read and evaluate complex expressions without confusion, 
we use terms and brackets.
•	 When an expression is written as a sum of terms, changing the order 
of the terms or grouping the terms does not change the value of the 
expression. This is because the “commutative property of addition” 
and the “associative property of addition”, respectively.
•	 To evaluate expressions within brackets, we saw that when we 
remove brackets preceded by a negative sign, the terms within the 
bracket change their sign.
•	 We also learnt about the “distributive property” — multiplying a 
number with an expression inside brackets is equal to the multiplying 
the number with each term in the bracket.

Using three 3’s along with the four operations (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division) and brackets as needed we can create 
several expressions. For example, (3 + 3)/3 = 2, 3 + 3 – 3 = 3, 3 × 
3 + 3 = 12, and so on.
Using four 4’s, create expressions to get all values from 1 to 20.
Using the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once in any order get 
as many values as possible between  – 10 and +10.
Using the numbers 0 to 9 exactly once in any order, make an 
expression with a value 100.

3.1 The Need for Smaller Units
Sonu’s mother was fixing a 
toy. She was trying to join 
two pieces with the help of 
a 
screw. 
Sonu 
was 
watching his mother with 
great curiosity. His mother 
was unable to join the 
pieces. Sonu asked why. 
His mother said that the 
screw was not of the 
right size.
She brought another screw from the box and was able to fix the toy. 
The two screws looked the same to Sonu. But when he observed them 
closely, he saw they were of slightly different lengths.
Sonu was fascinated 
by how such a small 
difference in lengths 
could matter so much. 
He was curious to 
know the difference 
in lengths. He was also 
curious to know how 
little 
the 
difference 
was 
because 
the 
screws looked nearly 
the same.
In the following figure, screws are placed above a scale. Measure 
them and write their length in the space provided.
A PEEK BEYOND 
THE POINT

A Peek Beyond the Point
Which scale helped you measure the length of the screws accurately? 
Why? 
What is the meaning of 2 7
10  cm (the length of the first screw)?
As seen on the ruler, the unit length between two consecutive 
numbers is divided into 10 equal parts. To get the length 2 7
10 cm, we 
go from 0 to 2 and then take seven parts of 1
10. The length of the screw 
is 2 cm and 7
10 cm. Similarly, we can make sense of the length 3 2
10 cm.
We read 2 7
10 cm as two and seven-tenth centimeters, and 3 2
10 cm 
as three and two-tenth centimeters.
Can you explain why the unit was divided into smaller parts to measure 
the screws?
Measure the following objects using a scale and write their 
measurements in centimeters (as shown earlier for the lengths of the 
screws): pen, sharpener, and any other object of your choice.

smaller units of measurement.
3.2 A Tenth Part
The length of the pencil shown in the figure below is 3 4
10 units, which can 
also be read as 3 units and four one-tenths, i.e., (3 × 1) + (4 × 1
10) units.
= 10 times 1
10 = 10 × 1
10 = 1 unit 
This length is the same as 34 one-tenths units because 10 one-tenths 
units make one unit.

Sonu is measuring some of his body parts. The length of Sonu’s lower 
arm is 2 7
10 units, and that of his upper arm is 3 6
10 units. What is the 
total length of his arm?
To get the total length, let us see the lower and upper arm length as 
2 units and 7 one-tenths, and 3 units and 6 one-tenths, respectively.
So, there are (2 + 3) units and (7 + 6) one-tenths. Together, they make 
5 units and 13 one-tenths. But 13 one-tenths is 1 unit and 3 one-tenths. 
So, the total length is 6 units and 3 one-tenths.

= 6 + 3

= 6 3

Or, both the lengths can be converted to tenths and then added:

The length of Shylaja’s hand is 12 4
10 units, 
and her palm is 6 7

The length of the finger can be found by 
evaluating (12 + 4
10) – (6 + 7
10). This can be 
done in different ways. For example,
(a)	 12 + 4

Now, the number has 11 units and 14 one-tenths. We subtract 7 one-
tenths from 14 one-tenths and then subtract 6 units from 11 units.
Try computing the difference by converting both lengths to tenths.

We can say that its 
length is between 4 4
10 
units and 4 5
10 units. But 
we cannot state its exact 
measurement, since there 
are no markings. Earlier, 
we split a unit into 10 
one-tenths 
to 
measure 
smaller lengths. We can 
do something similar and 
split each one-tenth into 
10 parts.
What is the length of this 
smaller part? How many 
such smaller  parts make 
a unit length?
As shown in the figure 
below, each one-tenth has 
10 smaller parts, and there are 10 one-tenths in a unit; therefore, there 
will be 100 smaller parts in a unit. Therefore, one part’s length will 
be 1
100 of a unit.
Returning to our question, what is the length of the folded paper? 
We can see that it ends at 4 4

100, read as 4 units and 4 one-tenths 
and 5 one-hundredths.

into 10 equal parts and when the 
unit is split into 4 equal parts.
If an even more precise measure 
is needed, each quarter can further 
be split into four equal parts. Each 
part then measures 1
16 of a unit, i.e., 
16 such parts make 1 unit.
Then why split a unit into 10 parts every time?
The reason is the special role that 10 plays in the Indian place value 
system. For a whole number written in the Indian place value system — 
for example, 281 — the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is 
tens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger 
than the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is 
10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left:
10 ones make 1 ten,
10 tens make 1 hundred,
10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on.

In order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities 
smaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts. What does 
this give? It gives one-tenth. Further dividing it into 10 parts gives 
one-hundredth, and so on.

What will the fraction be when 1
100 is split into 10 equal parts?
It will be

1000 , i.e., a thousand such parts make up a unit.
Just as when we extend to the left of 10,000, we get bigger place 
values at each step, we can also extend to the right of 
1
1000 , getting 
smaller place values at each step.

A Peek Beyond the Point
This way of writing numbers is called the “decimal system” since it 
is based on the number 10; “decem” means ten in Latin, which in turn 
is cognate to the Sanskrit daśha meaning 10, with similar words for 
10 occurring across many Indian languages including Odia, Konkani, 
Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Bodo, and Assamese. We shall learn 
about other ways of writing numbers in later grades.
How Big?
We already know that a hundred 10s make 1000, and a hundred 100s 
make 10000.
We can ask similar questions about fractional parts:
(a)	 	How many thousandths make one unit?
(b)	 	How many thousandths make one tenth?
(c)	 	How many thousandths make one hundredth?
(d)	 	How many tenths make one ten?
(e)	 	How many hundredths make one ten?
Make a few more questions of this kind and answer them.
Notation, Writing and Reading of Numbers
We have been writing numbers in a particular way, say 456, instead of 
writing them as 4 × 100 (4 hundreds) + 5 × 10 (5 tens) + 6 × 1 (6 ones). 
Similarly, can we skip writing tenths and hundredths?
Can the quantity 4 2
10 be written as 42 (skipping the 1
10 in 2 × 1
10) ? 
If yes, how would we know if 42 means 4 tens and 2 units or it 
means 4 units and 2 tenths?
Similarly, 705 could mean:
(a)	 	7 hundreds, and 0 tens and 5 ones (700 + 0 + 5)
(b)	 	7 tens and 0 units and 5 tenths (70 + 0 + 5
10)
(c)	 	7 units and 0 tenths and 5 hundredths (7 + 0

Since these are different quantities, we need to have distinct ways 
of writing them.
To identify the place value where integers end and the fractional 
parts start, we use a point or period (‘.’) as a separator, called a 
decimal point.
The above quantities in decimal notation are then:

Thus decimal notation is a natural extension of the Indian place 
value system to numbers also having fractional parts. Just as 705 means  
7 × 100 + 5 × 1, the number 70.5 means 7 × 10 + 5 × 1
10 , and 7.05 means  
7 × 1 +5 × 1
100. 
We have seen how to write numbers using the decimal point (‘.’). But 
how do we read/say these numbers?
We know that 705 is read as seven hundred and five.
70.5 is read as seventy point five, short for seventy and five-tenths.
7.05 is read as seven point zero five, short for seven and five 
hundredths.
0.274 is read as zero point two seven four. We don’t read it as zero 
point two hundred and seventy four as 0.274 means 2 one-tenths 
and 7 one-hundredths and 4 one-thousandths.
Make a place value table similar to the one above. Write each quantity 
in decimal form and in terms of place value, and read the number:
(a)	 	2 ones, 3 tenths and 5 hundredths
(b)	 	1 ten and 5 tenths

Length Conversion
We have been using a scale to measure length for a few years. We 
already know that 1 cm = 10 mm (millimeters).
How many cm is 1 mm?
1 mm = 1
10 cm = 0.1 cm (i.e., one-tenth of a cm).
How many cm is (a) 5 mm? (b) 12 mm?
5 mm = 5
10 cm = 0.5 cm
12 mm = 10 mm + 2 mm 
 	
  = 1 cm + 2
10 cm 
   	
  = 1.2 cm.

Weight Conversion
Let us look at kilograms (kg). We know that 1 kg = 1000 gram (g). We 
can say that
1 g = 
1
1000 kg = 0.001 kg.
How many kilograms is 5 g?
5 g =

1000 kg = 0.005 kg.
How many kilograms is 10 g?
10 g = 10
1000 kg = 1
100 kg = 0.010 kg.

Look at the picture below showing different quantities of rice. 
Starting from the 1g heap, subsequent heaps can be found that are 10 
times heavier than the previous heap/packets. The combined weight of 
rice in this picture is 11.111 kg.
Also, 
1 gram = 1000 milligrams (mg). So, 1 mg = 
1
1000 g = 0.001 g.
Rupee ─ Paise conversion  
You may have heard of ‘paisa’. 100 paise is equal to 1 rupee. As we have 
coins and notes for rupees, coins for paise were also used commonly 
until recently. There were coins for 1 paisa, 2 paise, 3 paise, 5 paise, 10 
paise, 20 paise, 25 paise, and 50 paise. All denominations of 25 paise 
and less were removed from use in the year 2011. But we still see paise 
in bills, account statements, etc.
1 rupee = 100 paise
1 paisa = 1
100 rupee = 0.01 rupee

digit at this position is the greater of the two.
Why can we stop comparing at this point? Can we be sure that 
whatever digits are there after this will not affect our

Closest Decimals
Consider the decimal numbers 0.9, 1.1, 1.01, and 1.11. Identify the 
decimal number that is closest to 1.
Let us compare the decimal numbers. Arranging these in ascending 
order, we get 0.9 < 1 < 1.01 < 1.1 < 1.11. Among the neighbours of 1, 1.01 
is 1/100 away from 1 whereas 0.9 is 10/100 away from 1. Therefore, 
1.01 is closest to 1.
Which of the above is closest to 1.09?
Which among these is closest to 4: 3.56, 3.65, 3.099?
Which among these is closest to 1: 0.8, 0.69, 1.08?

Estimating Sums and Differences
Sonu has observed sums and differences of decimal numbers and says, 
“If we add two decimal numbers, then the sum will always be greater 
than the sum of their whole number parts. Also, the sum will always be 
less than 2 more than the sum of their whole number parts.” 
Let us use an example to understand what his claim means: 
If the two numbers to be added are 25.936 and 8.202, the claim is 
that their sum will be greater than 25 + 8 (whole number parts) and 
will be less than 25 + 1 + 8 + 1.
What do you think about this claim? Verify if this is true for these 
numbers. Will it work for any 2 decimal numbers? 
What about for the sum of 25.93603259 and 8.202?
Similarly, come up with a way to narrow down the range of whole 
numbers within which the difference of two decimal numbers 
will lie. 
Note to the Teacher: Estimating the result before computing may help in 
identifying if a mistake happens with the calculation.

Decimal and Measurement Disasters
Decimal point and unit conversion mistakes may seem minor sometimes 
but they can lead to serious problems. Here are some actual incidents

A Peek Beyond the Point
•	 In 2013, the finance office of Amsterdam City Council (Netherlands) 
mistakenly sent out €188 million in housing benefits instead of the 
intended €1.8 million due to a programming error that processed 
payments in euro cents instead of euros. (1 euro-cent = 1/100 
euro).
•	 In 1983, a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada 
Boeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300 
pounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1 
pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the 
pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield. 
Fortunately, everyone survived.
Several incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal 
numbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5 
mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed 
quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the 
location of the decimal point.
Deceptive Decimal Notation
Sarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post 
noon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.? 
None of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10 
equal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60 
minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach 
the station at 4:30.
Here is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width 
of an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a 
door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches 
(since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully.
I said the door’s 
width should be 
2.5 ft.
It is 2.5 ft! You 
can verify.

If you watch cricket, you might have noticed decimal-looking 
numbers like ‘Overs left: 5.5’. Does this mean 5 overs and 5 balls or 5 
overs and 3 balls? Here, 5.5 overs means 5 5
6 overs (as 1 over = 6 balls), 
i.e., 5 overs and 5 balls.
Where else can we see such ‘non-decimals’ with a decimal-like 
notation? 
A Pinch of History – Decimal Notation Over Time
Decimal fractions (i.e., fractions with denominators like 1
10 , 
1
100 , 
1
1000 , and so on) are used in the works of a number of ancient Indian 
astronomers and mathematicians, including in the important 8th 
century works of Śhrīdharāchārya on arithmetic and algebra. Decimal 
notation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in 
Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al Hindī (The Book of Chapters on Indian 
Arithmetic) by Abūl Ḥassan al-Uqlīdisī, an Arab mathematician, in 
around 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0ˈ 059375.
In the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional 
parts, a number of different notations were used:
•	 a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as 
shown above),
•	 use of different colours and
•	 a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal 
places (0.36 would be written as 36
2
).
In the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and 
Christopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period 
(‘.’) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while 
François Viète, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead. 
Currently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer 
part and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5 
is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal 
point has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers 
having fractional parts in the Indian place value system.

4.1 The Notion of Letter-Numbers
In this chapter we shall look at a concise way of expressing mathematical 
relations and patterns. We shall see how this helps us in thinking about 
these relationships and patterns, and in explaining why they may hold 
true. 
Example 1: Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab. When Aftab’s age 
10 years, Shabnam’s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab’s age is 18 years, 
what will Shabnam’s age be? _______ 
Given Aftab’s age, how will you find out Shabnam’s age?
Easy: We add 3 to Aftab’s age to get Shabnam’s age.
Can we write this as an expression? 
Shabnam’s age is 3 years more than Aftab’s. In short, this can be 
written as:
Shabnam’s age = Aftab’s age + 3.
Such 
mathematical 
relations 
are 
generally represented in a shorthand 
form. In the relation above, instead 
of writing the phrase ‘Aftab’s Age’, 
the convention is to use a convenient 
symbol. Usually, letters or short phrases 
are used for this purpose.
Let us say we use the letter a to 
denote Aftab’s age (we could have 
used any other letter), and s to denote 
Shabnam’s age. Then the expression to 
find Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as
s = a + 3.
If a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age?

Shabnam’s age

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Replacing a by 23 in the expression a + 3, we get, s = 23 + 3 = 26 years.
Letters such as a and s that are used to represent numbers are called 
letter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers, 
such as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions.
Given the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab’s age.
We know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab’s 
age will be 3 less than Shabnam’s. This can be described as
	
	
Aftab’s age = Shabnam’s age – 3.
If we again use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age and the letter s 
to denote Shabnam’s age, then the algebraic expression would be:  
a = s – 3, meaning 3 less than s.
Use this expression to find Aftab’s age if Shabnam’s age is 20.
Example 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns. He repeatedly 
places Ls next to each other. Each L has two matchsticks as shown in 
Figure 4.2.
Fig. 4.2
How many matchsticks are needed to make 5 Ls? It will be 5 × 2.
How many matchsticks are needed to make 7 Ls? It will be 7 × 2.
How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 × 2.
Now, what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number 
of sticks?
First, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L 
needs 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2 
times the number of L’s. This can be written as:
Number of matchsticks = 2 × Number of L’s
Now, we can use any letter to denote the number of L’s. Let’s use n. 
The algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be:
2 × n.
This expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make 
n L’s. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the 
number of L.
Example 3: Ketaki prepares and supplies coconut-jaggery laddus. The 
price of a coconut is ₹35 and the price of 1 kg jaggery is ₹60.
82
Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
How much should she pay if she buys 10 coconuts and 5 kg jaggery?
Cost of 10 coconuts = 10 × ₹35
Cost of 5 kg jaggery = 5 × ₹60
Total cost = 10 × ₹35 + 5 × ₹60 = ₹350 + ₹300 = ₹650.
How much should she pay if she buys 8 coconuts and 9 kg jaggery?
Write an algebraic expression to find the total amount to be paid for a 
given number of coconuts and quantity of jaggery.
Let us identify the relationships and then write the expressions.
Quantity needed
Relationship
Expression
Cost of coconuts 
Number of 
coconuts × 35
c × 35
Cost of jaggery 
Number of kgs of 
jaggery × 60
j × 60
Here, ‘c’ represents the number of coconuts and ‘j’ represents the 
number of kgs of jaggery. The total amount to be paid will be: 
Cost of coconuts + Cost of jaggery.
The corresponding algebraic expression can be written as:
c × 35 + j × 60
Use this expression (or formula) to find the total amount to be paid for 
7 coconuts and 4 kg jaggery.
Notice that for different values of ‘c’ and ‘j’, the value of the expression 
also changes.
Writing this expression as a sum of terms we get: 
+
c × 35
j × 60
Example 4: We are familiar with calculating the perimeters of simple 
shapes. Write expressions for perimeters.
The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of its side. This can 
be written as the expression: 4 × q, where q stands for the sidelength.
What is the perimeter of a square with sidelength 7 cm? Use the 
expression to find out.
You must have realised how the use of letter-numbers and algebraic 
expressions allows us to express general mathematical relations in

4.2 Revisiting Arithmetic Expressions
We learnt to write expressions as sums of terms and it became easy 
for us to read arithmetic expressions. Many times they could have 
been read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping 
(adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers 
by grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating 
expressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of 
the expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including 
brackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive 
property (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples).
Let us revise these concepts and find the values of the following 
expressions:
1.	
23 – 10 × 2	
2. 	
83 + 28 – 13 + 32
3.	
34 – 14 + 20	
4. 	
42 + 15 – (8 – 7)
5.	
68 – (18 + 13)	
6. 	
7 × 4 + 9 × 6
7.	
20 + 8 × (16 – 6)
Let us evaluate the first expression, 23 – 10 × 2. First we shall write 
the terms of the expression. Notice that one of the terms is a number, 
while the other one has to be converted to a number before adding the 
two terms. 
23 – 10 × 2 = 23 + –10 × 2 = 23 + –20 = 3
w – 1
w
85
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Let us now evaluate the second one. All the terms of this expression 
are numbers. If we notice the terms, we find that it will be easier to 
evaluate if we swap and group the terms. 
83 + 28 – 13 + 32 = 
Let us now look at the fifth expression. It has brackets with a negative 
sign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways — by solving the bracket 
first (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets 
appropriately (as on the right side).
Now, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions. 
Algebraic expressions also take number values when the letter-
numbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for 
finding Shabnam’s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the 
letter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26.
4.3 Omission of the Multiplication Symbol in 
Algebraic Expressions
Look at this number sequence:
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...
How can we describe this sequence or pattern? Easy: These are the 
numbers appearing in the multiplication table of 4 (multiples of 4 in 
an increasing order).
What is the third term of this sequence? It is 4 × 3.
What is the 29th term of this sequence? It is 4 × 29.
Find an algebraic expression to get the nth term of this sequence.
Note that here ‘n’ is a letter-number that denotes a position in the 
sequence.

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
As it is the sequence of multiples of 4, it can be seen that the nth term 
will be 4 times n:
4 × n
As a standard practice, we shorten 4 × n to 4n by skipping the 
multiplication sign. We write the number first, followed by the letter(s).
Find the value of the expression 7k when k = 4. The value is 7 × 4 = 28.
Find the value that the expression 5m + 3 takes when m = 2.
As 5m stands for 5 × m, the value of the expression when m = 2 is
5 × 2 + 3 = 13.
Mind the Mistake, Mend the Mistake
Some simplifications are shown below where the letter-numbers are 
replaced by numbers and the value of the expression is obtained. 
1.	Observe each of them and identify if there is a mistake. 
2.	If you think there is a mistake, try to explain what might have gone 
wrong. 
3.	Then, correct it and give the value of the expression.
4.4 Simplification of Algebraic Expressions
Earlier we found expressions to find perimeters of different regular 
figures in terms of their sides. Let us now find an expression to find the 
perimeter of a rectangle. 
1
If a = – 4,
then 10 – a = 6.
2
If d = 6,
then 3d = 36.
3
If s = 7,
then 3s – 2 = 15.
4
If r = 8,
then 2r + 1 = 29.
5
If j = 5,
then 2j = 10.
6
If m = –6,
then 3 (m + 1) = 19.
7
If f = 3, g = 1
then 2f – 2g = 2.
8
If t = 4, b = 3
then 2t + b = 24.
9
If h = 5, n = 6
then h – (3 – n) = 4.
87
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
As in the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter 
when the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known: 
Find the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth.
Let us use the letter-numbers l and b in place of length and breadth 
respectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have 
p = l + b + l + b
As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an 
expression can be added in any order. Hence the above expression can 
be written as:
= l + l + b + b
As l + l = 2 × l = 2l, and b + b = 2 × b = 2b, we have 
p = 2l + 2b.
Notice that the initial expression (l + b + l + b) and the final expression 
(2l + 2b) that we got for the perimeter look different. However, they 
are equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by 
applying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are 
equal in the sense that they both take the same values when letter-
numbers are replaced by numbers. 
For example, if we assign l = 3, b = 4, we get
l + b + l + b = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14, and
2l + 2b = 2 × 3 + 2 × 4 = 14.
We call the expression 2l + 2b the simplified form of l + b + l + b.
Let us see some more examples of simplification.
Example 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers 
sold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d. Find 
the total money earned by the shopkeeper during these three days.
Day 1
Day 2
Day 3
Pencils 
(Price ‘c’)

Erasers

Let us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils.
The money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c. Similarly, the 
money earned by selling pencils on Day 2 is _____, and Day 3 is ______.
The total money earned by the sale of pencils is 5c + 3c + 10c. Can we 
simplify this expression further and reduce the number of terms?
88
Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
The expression means 5 times c is added to 3 times c is added to 10 
times c. So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This 
is what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus,
5 × c + 3 × c + 10 × c = (5 + 3 + 10) × c
(5 + 3 + 10) × c can be simplified to 18 × c = 18c. 
If c = ₹50, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils.
Write the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers. 
Then, simplify the expression.
The expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and 
erasers during these three days is 18c + 11d.
Can the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further?
There is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains 
different letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form.
In this problem, we saw the expression 5c + 3c + 10c getting simplified 
to the expression 18c. 
Check that both expressions take the same value when c is replaced by 
different numbers. 
Example 6: A big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as 
shown. Write an expression describing the area of the bigger rectangle.
The areas of the smaller rectangles are 4v sq. units and 3v sq. units. 
The area of the bigger rectangle can be found in two ways: (i) by 
directly using its side lengths v and (4 + 3), or (ii) by adding the areas 
of the smaller rectangles.
The first way gives 7v, and the second way gives 4v + 3v. We know 
that they are equal: 4v + 3v = 7v, and this is the required expression for 
the area of the bigger rectangle.
As earlier, a big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown 
below. Write an expression to find the area of the rectangle AEFD. 
Another way of seeing 
the distributive 
property.

89
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Even in this case, the area of rectangle AEFD can be found in two 
ways: (i) by directly using the side lengths n and (12 – 4), or (ii) 
subtracting the area of the rectangle EBCF from that of ABCD.
The first method gives us 8n, and the second method gives us  
12n – 4n, and they are equal, since 12n – 4n = 8n. This is the expression

Sets of terms such as (5c, c, 10c), (12n, – 4n) that involve the same 
letter-numbers are called like terms. Sets of terms such as {18c, 11d} 
are called unlike terms as they have different letter-numbers.
As we have seen, like terms can be added together and simplified 
into a single term.
Example 7: A shop rents out chairs 
and tables for a day’s use. To rent 
them, one has to first pay the following 
amount per piece.
When the furniture is returned, the 
shopkeeper pays back some amount 
as follows.
Write an expression for the total 
number of rupees paid if x chairs and 
y tables are rented.
For x chairs and y tables, let us find the total amount paid at the 
beginning and the amount one gets back after returning the furniture. 
Describe the procedure to get these amounts.
The total amount in rupees paid at the beginning is 40x + 75y, and 
the total amount returned is 6x + 10y.
So, the total amount paid = (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y). 
Can we simplify this expression? If yes, how? If not, why not?

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
Recalling how we open brackets in an arithmetic expression, we get
(40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) = (40x + 75y) – 6x – 10y
Since the terms can be added in any order, the remaining bracket 
can be opened and the expression becomes 40x + 75y + – 6x + – 10y
We can group the like terms together, This results in
40x + – 6x + 75y + – 10y
= (40 – 6)x + (75 – 10)y
= 34x + 65y.
The expression (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) is simplified to 34x + 65y, 
which is the total amount paid in rupees.
Could we have written the initial expression as  
(40x + 75y) + (– 6x – 10y)?
Example 8: Charu has been through three rounds of a quiz. Her scores 
in the three rounds are 7p – 3q, 8p – 4q, and 6p – 2q. Here, p represents 
the score for a correct answer and q represents the penalty for an 
incorrect answer. 
What do each of the expressions mean? 
If the score for a correct answer is 4 (p = 4) and the penalty for a wrong 
answer is 1 (q = 1), find Charu’s score in the first round.
Charu’s score is 7 × 4 – 3 × 1. We can evaluate this expression by 
writing it as a sum of terms.
7 × 4 – 3 × 1 = 7 × 4 + – 3 × 1 = 28 + – 3 = 25 
What are her scores in the second and third rounds? 
What if there is no penalty? What will be the value of q in that 
situation? 
What is her final score after the three rounds? 
Her 
final 
score 
will 
be 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
three 
scores:  
(7p – 3q) + (8p – 4q) + (6p – 2q).
Since the terms can be added in any order, we can remove the 
brackets and write
7p + – 3q + 8p + – 4q + 6p + –2q
= 7p + 8p + 6p + – (3q) + – (4q) + – (2q)   (by swapping and grouping)
= (7 + 8 + 6)p + – (3 + 4 + 2)q
= 21p + – 9q 
= 21p – 9q.
Charu’s total score after three rounds is 21p – 9q. Her friend Krishita’s 
score after three rounds is 23p – 7q.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Give some possible scores for Krishita in the three rounds so that they 
add up to give 23p – 7q.
Can we say who scored more? Can you explain why?
How much more has Krishita scored than Charu? This can be found by 
finding the difference between the two scores.
23p – 7q – (21p – 9q)
Simplify this expression further.
Example 9: Simplify the expression 4 (x + y) – y
Using the distributive property, this expression can be simplified to
4 (x + y) – y = 4x + 4y – y
	
= 4x + 4y + – y 
	
= 4x + (4 – 1)y
	
= 4x + 3y.
Example 10: Are the expressions 5u and 5 + u equal to each other?
The expression 5u means 5 times the number u, and the expression 
5 + u means 5 more than the number u. These two being different 
operations, they should give different values for most values of u. 
Let us check this.
Fill the blanks below by replacing the letter-numbers by numbers; an 
example is shown. Then compare the values that 5u and 5 + u take.
If the expressions 5u and 5 + u are equal, then they should take the

same values for any given value of u. But we can see that they do not. 
So, these two expressions are not equal.
Are the expressions 10y – 3 and 10(y – 3) equal? 
10y – 3, short for 10 × y – 3, means 3 less than 10 times y,
10(y – 3), short for 10 × (y – 3), means 10 times (3 less than y).
Let us compare the values that these expressions take for different 
values of y.
 
After filling in the two diagrams, do you think the two expressions are 
equal?
Example 11: What is the sum of the numbers 
in the picture (unknown values are denoted by 
letter-numbers)?
 There are many ways to go about it. Here, we 
show some of them.
1.		
Adding row wise gives:
(4 × 3) + (r + s) + (r + s) + (4 × 3)
2.		
Adding like terms together gives:
(8 × 3) + (r + r) + (s + s)
3.		
Adding the upper half and doubling gives:
2 × (4 × 3 + r + s)
The three expressions might seem different. We can simplify each 
one and see that they all are the same: 2r + 2s + 24.

4.5 Pick Patterns and Reveal Relationships
In the first section we got a glimpse of algebraic expressions and 
how to use them to describe simple patterns and relationships in a 
concise and elegant manner. Here, we continue to look for general 
relationships between quantities in different scenarios, find patterns 
and, interestingly, even explain why these patterns occur.
 Remember the importance of describing in simple language, or 
visualising mathematical  relationships, before trying to write them as 
expressions.
Formula Detective
Look at the picture given. In each case, the number machine takes in 
the 2 numbers at the top of the ‘Y’ as inputs, performs some operations 
and produces the result at the bottom. The machine performs the same 
operations on its inputs in each case.
Find out the formula of this number machine.
The formula for the number machine above is “two times the first 
number minus the second number”. When written as an algebraic 
expression, the formula is 2a – b. The expression for the first set of 
inputs is 2 × 5 – 2 = 8. Check that the formula holds true for each set  
of inputs.

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
Let us start with design C. It appears for the first time at position 3, 
the second time at position 6. 
Where would design C appear for the nth time?
We can see that this design appears in positions that are multiples of 
3. So the nth occurrence of Design C will be at position 3n.
Similarly, find the formula that gives the position where the other 
Designs appear for the nth time.
The positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on.
We can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one 
less than the position at which Design C appears for the nth time. Thus, 
the nth occurrence of Design B is at position:
3n – 1
Similarly, the expression describing the position at which the design 
A appears for the nth time is: 3n – 2.
Given a position number can we find out the design that appears there? 
Which Design appears at Position 122?
If the position is a multiple of 3, then clearly we have Design C. As 
seen earlier, if the position is one less than a multiple of 3, it has Design 
B, and if it is 2 less than a multiple of 3, then it has Design A. 
Can the remainder obtained by dividing the position number by 3 be 
used for this? Observe the table below.

Patterns in a Calendar
Here is the calendar of November 2024. Consider 2 × 2 squares, 
as marked in the calendar. The numbers in this square show an 
interesting property.
97
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Let us take the marked 2 × 2 square, and 
consider the numbers lying on the diagonals; 
12 and 20; 13 and 19. Find their sums; 12 + 20,  
13 + 19. What do you observe?
They are equal. 
Let us extend the numbers in the calendar beyond 
30, creating endless rows.
Will the diagonal sums be equal in every 2 × 2 square in this endless 
grid? How can we be sure? 
To be sure of this we cannot check with all 2 × 2 squares as there are 
an unlimited number of them.
Let us consider a 2 × 2 square. Its top left number can be any number. 
Let us call it ‘a’. 
Given that we know the top left number, how do we 
find the other numbers in this 2 × 2 square?
As we have been doing, first let us describe the other 
numbers in words.

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
•	 the number to the right of ‘a’ will be 1 more than it.
•	 the number below ‘a’ will be 7 more than it.
•	 the number diagonal to ‘a’ will be 8 more than it.
So the other numbers in the 2 × 2 square can be 
represented as shown in the grid. Let us find the 
diagonal sums; a + (a + 8), and (a + 1) + (a + 7).
Let us simplify them.
Since the terms can be added in any order, the 
brackets can be opened.
a + (a + 8) = a + a + 8 = 2a + 8
(a + 1) + (a + 7) = a + 1 + a + 7 = a + a + 1 + 7 = 2a + 8
We see that both diagonal sums are equal to 2a + 8 (8 more than  
2 times a).
Verify this expression for diagonal sums by considering any 2 × 2 
square and taking its top left number to be ‘a’. 
Thus, we have shown that diagonal sums are equal for any value of 
a, i.e., for any 2 × 2 square!
 
Consider a set of numbers from the calendar (having endless rows) 
forming under the following shape:
Find the sum of all the numbers. Compare it with the number in the 
centre: 15. Repeat this for another set of numbers that forms this shape. 
What do you observe? 
We see that the total sum is always 5 times the number in the centre.
Will this always happen? How do you show this?
[Hint: Consider a general set of numbers that forms this shape. 
Take the number at the centre to be ‘a’. Express the other numbers in 
terms of ‘a’.]
Find other shapes for which the sum of the numbers within the 
figure is always a multiple of one of the numbers.

a + 1
a + 7
a + 8
This problem is an example that shows the power of algebraic modelling 
in verifying whether a pattern will always hold.

How many matchsticks will there be in Step 33, Step 84, and Step 108? 
Of course, we can draw and count, but is there a quicker way to find 
the answers using the pattern present here?
What is the general rule to find the number of matchsticks in the 
next step? We can see that at each step 2 matchsticks are placed to get 
the next one, i.e., the number of matchsticks increases by 2 every time.

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
What could be an expression describing the rule/formula to find out 
the number of matchsticks at any step?
The pattern is such that in Step 10, nine 2s and an added 3 (3 + 2 × 
9) gives the number of matchsticks; in Step 11, ten 2s and an added 
3 (3 + 2 × 10) gives the number of matchsticks. For step y, what is  
the expression?
It is: one less than y (i.e. y – 1) 2s and a 3.
Therefore, the expression is
3 + 2 × (y – 1).
This expression gives the number of matchsticks in Step y. Now we 
can find the number of matchsticks at any step quickly.
You might have already noticed that there is a 2 in the first step also, 
3 = 1 + 2. Using this, the expression we get is 
2y + 1.
Does the above expression also give the number of matchsticks at each 
step correctly? Are these expressions the same?
We can check by simplifying the expression 3 + 2 × (y – 1).
3 + 2 × (y – 1) = 3 + 2y – 2
= 2y + 1.
Both expressions are the same.
There is a different way to count, or see the pattern. Let us take a 
look at the picture again.
Matchsticks are placed in two orientations — (a) horizontal ones at 
the top and bottom, and (b) the ones placed diagonally in the middle. 
For example, in step 2 there are 2 matchsticks placed horizontally and 
3 matchsticks placed diagonally. 
What are these numbers in Step 3 and Step 4?
How does the number of matchsticks change in each orientation as the 
steps increase? Write an expression for the number of matchsticks at 
Step ‘y’ in each orientation. Do the two expressions add up to 2y + 1?

•	 Algebraic expressions are used in formulas to model patterns 
and mathematical relationships between quantities, and to make 
predictions.
•	 Algebraic expressions use not only numbers but also letter-numbers. 
The rules for manipulating arithmetic expressions also apply to 
algebraic expressions. These rules can be used to reduce algebraic 
expressions to their simplest forms.
•	 Algebraic expressions can be described in ordinary language, and 
vice versa. Patterns or relationships that are easily written using 
algebra can often be long and complex in ordinary language. This is 
one of the advantages of algebra.

1.1 A Lakh Varieties!
Eshwarappa is a farmer in Chintamani, 
a town in Karnataka. He visits the 
market regularly to buy seeds for his 
rice field. During one such visit he 
overheard a conversation between 
Ramanna and Lakshmamma. Ramanna 
said, “Earlier our country had about a 
lakh varieties of rice. Farmers used to 
preserve different varieties of seeds 
and use them to grow rice. Now, we 
only have a handful of varieties. Also, 
farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds”.
Lakshmamma said, “There is a seed bank near my house. So far, they 
have collected about a hundred indigenous varieties of rice seeds from 
different places. You can also buy seeds from there.”
You may have heard the word ‘lakh’ 
before. Do you know how big one lakh is? Let 
us find out.
Eshwarappa shared this incident with his 
daughter Roxie and son Estu .
Estu was surprised to know that there 
were about one lakh varieties of rice in this 
country. He wondered “One lakh! So far I 
have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new 
variety each day, would we even come close 
to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100 
years?”
What do you think? Guess.

Roxie and Estu found that if they ate 
one variety of rice a day, they would come 
nowhere close to a lakh in a lifetime! Roxie 
suggests, “What if we ate 2 varieties of 
rice every day? Would we then be able to 
eat 1 lakh varieties of rice in 100 years?”
What if a person ate 3 varieties of rice every day? Will they be able to 
taste all the lakh varieties in a 100 year lifetime? Find out.
Estu said, “We know how many days there are in a year — 365, if 
we ignore leap years. If we live for y years, the number of days in our 
lifetime will be 365 × y.”

Getting a Feel of Large Numbers
You may have come across interesting facts like these: 
•	 	The world’s tallest statue is the ‘Statue of Unity’ 
in Gujarat depicting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Its 
height is about 180 metres.
•	 Kunchikal waterfall in Karnataka is said to drop 
from a height of about 450 metres.
It is not always easy to get a sense of how big these measurements 
are. But, we can get a better sense of their size when we compare them 
with something familiar. Let us see an example.
Look at the picture on the right. Somu is 1 metre tall. If each floor 
is about four times his height, what is the approximate height of the 
building?
Which is taller — The Statue of Unity or this building? How much taller? 
____________m.
We can see that the 
height of the Statue of Unity 
is close to 4 times the height 
of Somu’s building.

Is One Lakh a Very Large Number?
Eshwarappa asked Roxie and Estu, “Is a lakh big or 
small?” 
Roxie feels that 1 lakh is a large number:
•	 “We had one lakh varieties of rice — that 
is a lot.”
•	 “Living 1 lakh days would mean living for 274 
years — that is a really long time!”
•	 “If 1 lakh people stood shoulder to shoulder in a line they could 
stretch as far as 38 kilometres.”
Estu, however, thinks it is not that big:
•	 “Do you know that the cricket stadium in 
Ahmedabad has a seating capacity of more 
than 1 lakh? One lakh people in such a small 
area!”
•	 “Most humans have 80,000 to 1,20,000 hairs on 
their heads. Imagine, 1 lakh hairs fit in such a 
tiny space!”
•	 “I heard that there are some species of fish 
where a female fish can lay almost one lakh 
eggs at once very comfortably. Some even lay tens of lakhs of eggs 
at a time.”
How do you view a lakh — is a lakh big or small?
Reading and Writing Numbers
We have already been using commas for 5-digit numbers like 45,830 in 
the Indian place value system. As numbers grow bigger, using commas 
helps in reading the numbers easily. We use a comma in between the 
digits representing the “ten thousands” place and the “one lakh” place 
as you have seen just before (1,00,000).
The number name of 12,78,830 is twelve lakh seventy eight thousand 
eight hundred thirty.
Similarly, the number 15,75,000 in words is fifteen lakh seventy five 
thousand.

What if we press the +10,00,000 button ten times? What number 
will come up? How many zeroes will it have? What should we call it? 
The number will be 100 lakhs, which is also called a crore. 1 crore is 
written as 1,00,00,000 — it is 1 followed by seven zeroes.
1.3 Of Crores and Crores!
The table below shows some numbers according to both the Indian 
system and the American system (also called the International system) 
of naming numerals and placing commas. Observe the placement of 
commas in both systems.

One arab or One 
hundred crores
1,000,000,000
One billion
Notice that in the Indian system, commas are placed to group the 
digits in a 3-2-2-2... pattern from right to left (thousands, lakhs, crores, 
etc.). In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a 
3-3-3-3… pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.).
The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan, 
Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and 
Myanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words 
lakṣha (लक्ष) and koṭi (कोटि‍). The American system is also used in many 
countries.
Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore.
1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes.
1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes.
A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a 
lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand 
is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).
How many zeros does a thousand lakh have? _____

The number 9876501234 can be easily read by placing commas first:
(a)	 9,87,65,01,234 → 9 arab 87 crore 65 lakhs 1 thousand and 234 
or 987 crore 65 lakh 1 thousand 234 (in the Indian system).
(b)	 9,876,501,234 → 9 billion 876 million 501 thousand 234 (in the 
American system).

(a)	 One crore one lakh one thousand ten
(b)	 	One billion one million one thousand one
(c)	 	Ten crore twenty lakh thirty thousand forty
(d)	 Nine billion eighty million seven hundred thousand six hundred
3.	 	Compare and write ‘<’, ‘>’ or ‘=’:
(a)	 	30 thousand ____  3 lakhs
(b)	 	500 lakhs ______ 5 million
(c)	 	800 thousand ____ 8 million 
(d)	 	640 crore ______ 60 billion

What do you think of this conversation? Have you read or heard 
such headlines or statements?
Very often, exact numbers are not required and just an approximation 
is sufficient. For example, according to the 2011 census, the population 
of Chintamani town is 76,068. Instead, saying that the population is 
about 75,000 is enough to give an idea of how big the quantity is.
Bappi, call and 
check if Toofan 
Express is on time.
What 
number 
did you 
call?
I called  the 
rounded off 
number, of course! 
My teacher told 
us that efficient 
people deal with 
rounded off 
numbers.
There are situations where it makes sense to round up a number 
(rounding up is when the approximated number is more than the actual 
number). For example, if a school has 732 people including students, 
teachers and staff: the principal might order 750 sweets instead of 
700 sweets.  
There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down 
is when the approximated number is less than the actual number). For 
example, if the cost of an item is ₹470, the shopkeeper may say that the 
cost is around ₹450 instead of saying it is around ₹500. 
Think and share situations where it is appropriate to (a) round up,  
(b) round down, (c) either rounding up or rounding down is okay and 
(d) when exact numbers are needed.

Nearest Neighbours
With large numbers it is useful to know the nearest thousand, lakh or 
crore. For example, the nearest neighbours of the number 6,72,85,183 
are shown in the table below.
Nearest thousand     
6,72,85,000
Nearest ten thousand     
6,72,90,000
Nearest lakh     
6,73,00,000
Nearest ten lakh     
6,70,00,000
Nearest crore     
7,00,00,000
Similarly, write the five nearest neighbours for these numbers:
(a)	 3,87,69,957
(b)	 29,05,32,481
I have a number for which all five nearest neighbours are 
5,00,00,000. What could the number be? How many such numbers 
are there? 
Roxie and Estu are estimating the values of simple expressions.

know about the number of digits in the product 
of two 2-digit numbers. To know the smallest 
such product I took 10 × 10, so all other products 
will be greater than 100.
To know the greatest such product I 
multiplied the smallest 3-digit numbers (100 
× 100) to get 10,000; so the product of all the 
2-digit multiplications will be less than 10,000.”
Can multiplying a 3-digit number with another 3-digit number give a 
4-digit number?
Can multiplying a 4-digit number with a 2-digit number give a 5-digit 
number?

1.6 Did You Ever Wonder…?
Estu is amused by all these interesting facts about large numbers. While 
thinking about these, he came up with an unusual question, “Could the 
entire population of Mumbai fit into 1 lakh buses?”
What do you think? 
How can we find out?
Let us assume a bus can accommodate 50 people. Then 1 lakh buses 
can accommodate 1 lakh × 50 = 50 lakh people.
18
Large Numbers Around Us
The population of Mumbai is more than 1 crore 24 lakhs (we saw 
this in an earlier table). So, the entire population of Mumbai cannot fit 
in 1 lakh buses.
The RMS Titanic ship carried about 2500 passengers. Can the population 
of Mumbai fit into 5000 such ships?
Inspired by this strange question, Roxie wondered, “If I could travel 
100 kilometers every day, could I reach the Moon in 10 years?” (The 
distance between the Earth and the Moon is 3,84,400 km.)
How far would she have travelled in a year?
How far would she have travelled in 10 years?
Is it not easier to perform these calculations in stages? You can use 
this method for all large calculations.
Find out if you can reach the Sun in a lifetime, if you travel 1000 
kilometers every day. (You had written down the distance between the 
Earth and the Sun in a previous exercise.)
Make necessary reasonable assumptions and answer the questions 
below:
(a)	 	If a single sheet of paper weighs 5 grams, could you lift one 
lakh sheets of paper together at the same time?
(b)	 	If 250 babies are born every minute across the world, will a 
million babies be born in a day?
(c)	 	Can you count 1 million coins in a day? Assume you can count

FOREWORD
The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the 
country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments 
in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims 
to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and 
challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been 
well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 
(NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ 
inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), 
the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the stage for further learning 
at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical 
three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. 
The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the 
skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours 
to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to 
prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse 
curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including 
at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social 
Science, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational 
Education promotes their holistic development. 
Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential 
conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular 
areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content 
and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct 
instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other 
conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to 
establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is 
committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various 
Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, 
comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as 
their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. 
Ganita Prakash, the textbook of Mathematics for Grade 7, Part I, aligns with 
the expectations of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, with respect to creating a 
spark for initiating mathematical thinking. This textbook designed for Grade 
7 students, takes forward its journey through the world of mathematics that 
started in Grade 6. During this journey the concepts and problems emerge 
from daily life situations and so it is expected that students will be able to 
relate to them with ease. The book makes efforts to encourage the students 
to observe and explore the patterns around them and discover mathematical 
concepts on their own. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with 
other subject areas such as science, social science with cross-cutting themes 
like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and 
Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). Colourful illustrations and interactive 
exercises form the basis of this textbook that would develop a strong 
foundation among children in understanding more complex mathematical 
iv
concepts. Throughout the book, stories, conversations and anecdotes have 
been incorporated to make abstract mathematical concepts more relatable 
and accessible to young learners. Puzzles and innovative problems will not 
only engage the students in thoughtfully relating the mathematical concepts 
to the world around them and help them in deepening their understanding 
of mathematics, but also prepare them to understand the concepts of the 
emerging field of computational thinking. The focus is on collaboration and 
active engagement through student-centered approach to education. 
However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be 
encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play 
a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents 
and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to 
do so. 
With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in 
the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations 
of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback 
from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

ABOUT THE BOOK
Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but 
also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem solving, 
and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical 
knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other 
school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical 
Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics can also 
contribute to the development of capacities for making informed choices and 
decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary 
for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. 
Mathematics thus has an important role to play in achieving the overall aims 
of school education.
Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and has to perform 
the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of the 
child and being abstract. It must perform the dual role of developing intuition 
while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It must perform the dual 
role of enhancing critical and logical thinking while also developing artistry 
and creativity and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Finally, Mathematics 
must perform the dual role of providing students plenty of opportunities for 
exploration and discovery of concepts on their own while also teaching best-
known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics.
The present textbook has made an attempt to address the above mentioned 
goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers of this book have 
aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions 
and methods to develop in students both intuition and rigour. The book also 
provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student–teacher 
interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A 
number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout 
the book to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open-
ended to stimulate in-class discussion.
The first chapter of this book, ‘Large Numbers Around Us’, is an introduction 
to the world of lakhs and crores, and millions and billions through engaging 
explorations and contexts. 
Chapter 2, ‘Arithmetic Expressions’, considers expressions having multiple 
operations and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. 
Chapter 3, ‘A Peek Beyond the Point’, introduces the usage of the decimal 
point and additions and subtractions involving decimal numbers. Chapter 
4, ‘Expressions using Letter-Numbers’ builds on the chapter on Arithmetic 
Expressions to guide students to take the first steps into the world of algebra. 
The fundamental notions of letter-numbers and algebraic expressions are 
introduced. Chapter 5, ‘Parallel and Intersecting Lines’, introduces some 
fundamental building blocks of geometry and has a balance of engaging 
activities like paper folding and rigorous mathematical reasoning. Chapter 
6, ‘Number Play’, covers aspects of computational thinking and problem 
solving through puzzles and concepts of parity, the Virahāṅka-Fibonacci 
sequence, and cryptarithms. Chapter 7, ‘A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines’, 
vi
explores, through construction, some of the striking properties of a triangle 
related to the lengths of their sides and angles. Chapter 8, ‘Working with 
Fractions’, builds on the students’ understanding of fractions, and explores 
the multiplication and division of fractions. The methods and formulas of 
the great Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (628 CE) for performing these 
operations on fractions is brought alive with fresh examples and interesting 
puzzles. In all chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections 
with other subjects including Art, History, and Science.
By weaving together storytelling and hands-on activities, we hope that 
an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and 
fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give children 
the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other, provide logical 
arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. 
This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to 
understand what it means to prove something and also become confident 
about underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a 
blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage children to find 
many different ways to solve problems.
As per the NEP 2020, computational thinking has also been gently 
introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage 
such thinking. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving 
contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians 
have been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students 
aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to 
mathematics.
The concepts and problems are related to daily life situations. An attempt 
has been made to use contexts and materials with which the students are 
familiar. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book 
that may be photocopied and used. At many places, exercises or activities are 
given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. The textbook intends 
to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom.
We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in 
subsequent chapters to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. 
We hope that teachers will use this as an opportunity to revise these concepts 
in a spiralling way so that children are able to appreciate the entire conceptual 
structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may give more time to 
the ideas of fractions, negative numbers and other notions that are new to 
students. Many of these are the basis for further learning in mathematics.
Finally, this book aims to be more than just a textbook—it’s a passport 
to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration. Whether used in the 
classroom or at home, we hope that it may inspire students to embark on 
their own mathematical adventures, empowering them to see the beauty 
and relevance of mathematics in everything around them. With its engaging 
approach and comprehensive coverage of Grade 7 mathematics concepts, 
this book hopes and aims to captivate young minds and set them on a lifelong 
journey of mathematical discovery.
vii
I thank again all the writers of and contributors to this textbook for this 
important and valuable contribution and service to the nation’s mathematics 
teachers, learners and enthusiasts.
We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding the book 
and hope that you will send interesting exercises, activities and tasks that 
you develop during the course of teaching and learning, to be included in 
future editions.

NOTE TO THE TEACHER
We hope that this book, Ganita Prakash, will serve as a strong support and 
guide to you in achieving the exciting task that you have before you: that of 
passing on the joy of learning the beautiful subject of Mathematics to the next 
generation.
This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the 
flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms, 
where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or 
written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning 
mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are 
engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing 
patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. 
Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible 
solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have 
led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one 
cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding 
without these conditions.
Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. 
It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be 
thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given 
to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups.
Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges 
their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. 
While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in 
classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve 
efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing 
open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice 
a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students 
to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the 
students view and approach mathematics.
It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That 
takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities 
you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give 
to the students.
To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this 
book are marked using the icon 
. This icon is an indicator of a potential 
opportunity to start off a process of problem solving and exploration in the 
classroom. You will find some of the problems labelled “Math Talk”. Such 
questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion.
An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight 
important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problem-solving 
approaches. These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both 
where the owl is present and also in other similar situations.
xii
To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of 
concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to “cover” all 
of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality 
time on playing with and discussing them.
It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not 
only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening 
procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration.
Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One 
essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand 
mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to 
read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to 
interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the 
big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting 
word problems.
This book contains a number of open-ended problems. It also contains 
new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to solve them or 
follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay! Not everyone knows 
everything. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, 
it will be very useful to take it to the classroom and open it up for discussion. 
After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear 
can be clearly summarised. This process itself can throw a lot of light on the 
content.
In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when 
students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a 
wonderful example for them.
It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful time 
using this book!
Summary of Key Points
Time for Exploration
1.	 It is important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns, or 
challenges to the students and give them sufficient time to play with, 
discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups.
2.	 During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and 
acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured.
3.	 There should be a culture where students pose problems to each other 
and discuss with each other various ways to approach the problems.
About the Problems in the Book
1.	 The exploratory problems in the book not only promote problem 
solving; they also aim to strengthen procedural fluency when children 
start engaging in exploration.
xiii
2.	 Trying to ‘cover’ all the problems in the book must not happen at the 
cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with, 
discussing, and solving them.
Reading
1.	 Encourage students to read the book by themselves and in groups.
2.	 Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and to express 
it to others.
Right of Not Knowing!
1.	 It is perfectly okay if some of the content is not understood immediately. 
Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, it can 
also be taken to the classroom and opened up for discussion. After 
the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear 
can be clearly summarised. In these discussions, you can participate 
as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to 
understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them!
2.	 Learning is a continual process. Indeed, there is so much in 
mathematics that is still not known and requires further exploration!

A NOTE TO STUDENTS!
To be able to appreciate the art of mathematics, it is not enough to just be a 
passive spectator. You need to immerse yourself in its process like a detective 
getting into action to solve a mystery.
This is especially required when you see a new question or when a 
question arises from your own sense of wonder, or when you come across a 
new beautiful pattern. When you encounter these, pause your reading, and 
use your creativity to work out the question or understand and appreciate 
the pattern.
You will find that some questions are accompanied by their answers. Even 
if this is the case, it is worthwhile to work on the problems by yourself or in 
a group before you see the answer.
This will enrich your experience of going through the book!
Whenever there are questions coming up, you will see this icon:

indicates that it is time for figuring things out!
Sometimes you will find many questions collected together in a single 
place under the title ‘Figure it Out’.
Some questions are marked

8.1 Multiplication of Fractions
Aaron walks 3 kilometres in 1 hour. 
How far can he walk in 5 hours?
This is a simple question. We know 
that to find the distance, we need to 
find the product of 5 and 3, i.e., we 
multiply 5 and 3. 
Distance covered in 1 hour = 3 km.
Therefore, 
Distance covered in 5 hours
= 5 × 3 km
= 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 km
= 15 km.
Aaron’s pet tortoise walks at a much slower pace. It can walk only 1
4  
kilometre in 1 hour. How far can it walk in 3 hours?
Here, the distance covered in an hour is a fraction. This does not 
matter. The total distance covered is calculated in the same way, as 
multiplication.
Distance covered in 1 hour = 1
4 km.

Therefore, distance covered in 3 hours = 3 × 1

4 + 1

= 3
4 km.
The tortoise can walk 3
4 km in 3 hours.
Let us consider a case where the time spent walking is a fraction of 
an hour.
We saw that Aaron can walk 3 kilometres in 1 hour. How far can he 
walk in 1
5 hours?
We continue to calculate the total distance covered through 
multiplication.
Distance covered in 1
5 hours = 1
5  × 3 km.
Finding the product:
Distance covered in 1 hour = 3 km.
In 1
5 hours, distance covered is equal to the length we get by dividing 
3 km into 5 equal parts, which is  3
5 km.
This tells us that 1
5 × 3 = 3
5 .

Working with Fractions
Once again, we have —
Distance covered = 2
5 × 3 km.
Finding the product:
1.	 We can first find the distance covered in 1
5 hours.
2.	 Since, the duration 2
5  is twice 1
5, we multiply this distance by 2 to 
get the total distance covered.
Here is the calculation.
Distance covered in 1 hour = 3 km.
1.	 Distance covered in 1
5 hour 
	
= The length we get by dividing 3 km in 5 equal parts	
	
	
	
=  3
5 km.
2.	 Multiplying this distance by 2, we get 
	
2 × 3
5 = 6
5 km.
From this we can see that
2
5 × 3 = 6
5.
Discussion
We did this multiplication as follows:
•	 	First, we divided the 
multiplicand, 3 , by the 
denominator of the multiplier, 5, to get 3
5.

•	 	We then multiplied the result by the numerator of the multiplier, 
that is 2, to get 6
5. 
Thus, 
whenever 
we 
need 
to 
multiply a fraction and a whole 
number, we follow the steps above.
Example 
1: 
A 
farmer 
had 
5 
grandchildren. She distributed 2

of land to each of her grandchildren. 
How much land in all did she give to her grandchildren?

Example 2: 1 hour of internet time costs ₹8. How much will 1 1

Cost of  5
4 hour of internet time = 5

= 5 × 8

= 5 × 2
= 10.
It costs ₹10 for 1 1

So far, we have learnt multiplication of a whole number with a 
fraction, and a fraction with a whole number. What happens when 
both numbers in the multiplication are fractions?
Multiplying Two Fractions
We know, that Aaron’s pet tortoise can walk only 1
4 km in 1 hour. How 
far can it walk in half an hour?
Following 
our 
approach 
of 
using 
multiplication to solve such problems, we 
have,
Distance covered in 1
2 hour = 1
2 × 1
4 km.
Finding the product:
Distance covered in 1 hour = 1
4 km.
Therefore, the distance covered in 1
2 an hour is the length we get by 
dividing 1
4 into 2 equal parts.
To find this, it is useful to represent fractions using the unit square 
to stand for a “whole”.

Now we divide this 1
4 into 2 equal parts. What do we get?
What fraction of the whole is shaded?
Since the whole is divided into 8 equal parts 
and one of the parts is shaded, we can say that 1
8 
of the whole is shaded. So, the distance covered 
by the tortoise in half an hour is 1
8 km.
This tells us that 1
2 × 1
4 = 1
8.
If the tortoise walks faster and it can cover 2
5 km in 1 hour, how far will 
it walk in 3
4 of an hour?
Distance covered = 3
4 × 2
5.
Finding the product:
(i)	
First find the distance covered in 1
4 of an hour.
(ii)	
Multiply the result by 3, to get the distance covered in 3
4 of an 
hour.
(i)	
Distance in km covered in 1
4 of an hour
	
	= The quantity we get by dividing 2
5 into 
4 equal parts.
Taking the unit square as the whole, the 
shaded part (in Fig.   8.1) is a region we get 
when we divide 2
5 into 4 equal parts.
How much of the whole is it?
The whole is divided into
5 rows and 4 columns,
creating 5 × 4 = 20 equal parts.
Number of these parts shaded = 2.
So, the distance covered in 1
4 of an hour = 2
20 .

So, 3
4 × 2

Discussion
In the case of a fraction multiplied by 
another fraction, we follow a method 
similar to the one we used, when 
we multiplied a fraction by a whole 
number. We multiplied as follows:
2
5 ÷ 4 = 2
20 	
Divide the multiplicand by 4.

Using this understanding, multiply 5

2.
First, let us represent 3
2, taking the unit square as 
the whole. Since, the fraction 3
2 is one whole and a 
half, it can be seen as follows:
Following the steps of multiplication, we need to 
first divide this fraction 3
2 into 4 equal parts. It can 
be done as shown in the Fig. 8.2 with the yellow 
shaded region representing the fraction obtained 
by dividing 3
2 into 4 equal parts. What is its value?
We see that the whole is divided into —
2 rows and 4 columns,
creating 2 × 4 = 8 equal parts.
Number of parts shaded = 3.
So the yellow shaded part = 3
8.

Connection between the Area of a Rectangle and Fraction 
Multiplication
In the Fig. 8.3, what is the length and breadth of the shaded rectangle? 
Since we started with a unit square (of side 1 unit), the length and 
breadth are 1
2 unit and 1
4 unit.
What is the area of this rectangle? We see 
that 8 such rectangles give the square of area 
1 square unit. So, the area of each rectangle 
is 1
8 square units.
Do you see any relation between the area and 
the product of length and breadth?
The area of a rectangle of fractional sides equals the product  
of its sides.
In general, if we want to find the product of two fractions, we can 
find the area of the rectangle formed with the two fractions as its sides.

Working with Fractions
Doing this by representing the fractions using a unit square is 
cumbersome. Let us find the product by observing what we did in the 
above cases.
In each case, the whole is divided into rows and columns. 
The number of rows is the denominator of the multiplicand, which 
is 18 in this case.
The number of columns is the denominator 
of the multiplier, which is 12 in this case.
Thus, the whole is divided into 18 × 12 equal 
parts.
So, 1
18 × 1
12 = 
1
(18×12) = 1
216.
Thus, 
when 
two 
fractional 
units 
are 
multiplied, their product is
1
(product of denominators).
We express this as:
1
b × 1
d = 
1
b × d  .

Now, find 5
12 × 7
18. 
Like the previous case, let us find the product 
by performing the multiplication, step by step.
First, the whole is divided into 18 rows and 12 
columns creating 12 × 18 equal parts.
The value we get by dividing 7
18 into 12 equal 
parts is 
7
(12 × 18) .

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Then, we multiply this result by 5 to get 
the product. This is (5 ×  7)
(12 × 18).
So, 5
12 × 7
8 = (5 × 7)
(12 × 18) = 35
216. 
From this we can see that, in general,
a
b × c
d = a × c
b × d .
This formula was first stated in this general form by Brahmagupta in 
his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE. 
The formula above works even when the multiplier or multiplicand 
is a whole number. We can simply rewrite the whole number as a 
fraction with denominator 1. For example,
3 × 3
4 can be written 3
1 × 3
4
= 3×3
1×4 = 9
4.
And,
3
5 × 4 can be written 3
5 × 4
1
=  3 × 4
5 × 1 = 12
5 .
Multiplication of Fractions — Simplifying to Lowest Form
Multiply the following fractions and express the product in its lowest 
form:
12
7  × 5
24 
Instead of multiplying the numerators (12 and 5) and denominators 
(7 and 24) first and then simplifying, we could do the following:
12
7  × 5
24 = 12 × 5
7 × 24
We see that both the circled numbers have a common factor of 12. 
We know that a fraction remains the same when the numerator and 
denominator are divided by the common factor. In this case, we can 
divide them by 12.

When multiplying fractions, we can first divide the numerator 
and denominator by their common factors before multiplying the 
numerators and denominators. This is called cancelling the common 
factors.
A Pinch of History
In India, the process of reducing a fraction to its lowest terms — known 
as apavartana — is so well known that it finds mention even in a  
non-mathematical work. A Jaina scholar Umasvati (c. 150 CE) used it as 
a simile in a philosophical work.

Is the Product Always Greater than the Numbers 
Multiplied?
Since, we know that when a number is multiplied by 1, the product 
remains unchanged, we will look at multiplying pairs of numbers 
where neither of them is 1.
When we multiply two counting numbers greater than 1, say 3 and 
5, the product is greater than both the numbers being multiplied.
3 × 5 = 15 
The product, 15, is more than both 3 and 5.
But what happens when we multiply 1
4 and 8?
1
4 × 8 = 2
In the above multiplication the product, 2, is greater than 1
4, but less 
than 8.

184
Working with Fractions
let us express 3
4 as 15
20 and 2
5 as 8
20. 
From this we can see that the product is less than both the numbers.
When do you think the product is greater than both the numbers 
multiplied, when is it in between the two numbers, and when is it 
smaller than both?
[Hint: The relationship between the product and the numbers 
multiplied  depends on whether they are between 0 and 1 or they 
are greater than 1. Take different pairs of numbers and observe their 
product. For each multiplication, consider the following questions.]
Situation

Create more such examples for each situation and observe the 
relationship between the product and the numbers being multiplied. 
What can you conclude about the relationship between the numbers 
multiplied and the product? Fill in the blanks:
•	 	When one of the numbers being multiplied is between 0 and 1, 
the product is ____________ (greater/less) than the other number.
•	 	When one of the numbers being multiplied is greater than 1, the 
product is _____________ (greater/less) than the other number.

In general, note that the area of a rectangle remains the same even if 
the length and breadth are interchanged. 
The order of multiplication does not matter. Thus,

This can also be seen from Brahmagupta’s formula for multiplying

Discussion
In each of the division problems above, observe how we found the 
answer. Can we frame a rule that tells us how to divide two fractions?
Let us consider the previous problem.
In every division problem we have 
a dividend, divisor and quotient. The 
technique we have been using to get 
the quotient is:
1.	 	First, find the number which gives 
1 when multiplied by the divisor. 
We see that the resulting number is 
a fraction whose numerator is the 
divisor’s denominator and denominator is the divisor’s numerator.
	
For the divisor 3
5 this fraction is 5
3. We call 5
3 the reciprocal of 3
5. 
When we multiply a fraction by its reciprocal, we get 1. So, the first 
step in our technique is to find the divisor’s reciprocal.

2.	 	We then multiply the dividend with this reciprocal to get the 
quotient.
	
Summarising, to divide two fractions:
•	 	Find the reciprocal of the divisor
•	 	Multiply this by the dividend to get the quotient.
            So,	
 a
b ÷ c
d = d
c × a
b = d × a
c × b.
This can be rewritten as:
a
b ÷ c
d = a
b × d
c = a × d
b × c. 
As with methods and formulas for addition, subtraction, and 
multiplication of fractions that you learnt earlier, this method and 
formula for division of fractions, in this general form, was first explicitly 
stated by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (628 CE).
So, to evaluate, for example, 2
3 ÷ 3
5 using Brahmagupta’s formula 
above, we write:
2
3 ÷ 3
5 = 2
3 × 5
3 = 2 × 5
3 × 3 = 10
9 .
Dividend, Divisor and the Quotient
When we divide two whole numbers, say 6 ÷ 3, we get the quotient 2. 
Here the quotient is less than the dividend.
6 ÷ 3 = 2, 2 < 6
But what happens when we divide 6 by 1
4 ?
6 ÷ 1
4 = 24. 
Here the quotient is greater than the dividend!
What happens when we divide 1
8 by 1
4 ?
1
8 ÷ 1
4 = 1
2. 
Here too the quotient is greater than the dividend.
When do you think the quotient is less than the dividend and when 
is it greater than the dividend?
Is there a similar relationship between the divisor and the quotient?

8.3 Some Problems Involving Fractions
Example 3: Leena made 5 cups of tea. She used 1
4 litre of milk for this. 
How much milk is there in each cup of tea?
Leena used 1
4 litres of milk in 5 cups of tea. So, in 1 cup of tea the 
volume of milk should be:
1
4 ÷ 5.
Writing this as multiplication, we have:
5 × (milk per cup) = 1
4.
We perform the division as follows as per Brahmagupta’s method:
The reciprocal of 5 (the divisor) is 1
5.
Multiplying this reciprocal by the dividend ( 1
4 ), we get
1
5 × 1
4 = 1
20.
So, each cup of tea has 1
20 litre of milk.
Example 4: Some of the oldest examples of working with non-unit 
fractions occur in humanity’s oldest geometry texts, the Śhulbasūtra. 
Here is an example from Baudhāyana’s Śhulbasūtra (c. 800 BCE).

2 square units with square bricks each of whose 
sides is 1
5 units.

How many such square bricks are needed?
Each square brick has an area of 1
5 × 1
5 = 1
25 square units.
The total area to be covered is 7 1
2 sq. units = 15
2  sq. units.
As (Number of bricks) × (Area of a brick) = Total Area,
Number of bricks = 15
2  ÷ 1
25. 
The reciprocal of the divisor is 25.
Multiplying the reciprocal by the dividend, we get
25 × 15
2  = 25 × 15
2
 = 375
2 .
Example 5: This problem was posed by Chaturveda Pṛithūdakasvāmī 
(c. 
860 
CE) 
in 
his 
commentary 
on 
Brahmagupta’s 
book 
Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta.
Four fountains fill a cistern. The first fountain can fill the cistern in a 
day. The second can fill it in half a day. The third can fill it in a quarter of 
a day. The fourth can fill the cistern in one fifth of a day. If they all flow 
together, in how much time will they fill the cistern? 
Let us solve this problem step by step.
In a day, the number of times —
•	 	the first fountain will fill the cistern is 1÷ 1 = 1
•	 	the second fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ 1
2 = _____
•	 	the third fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷  1
4= _____
•	 	the fourth fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ 1
5 = _____
The number of times the four fountains together will fill the cistern 
in a day is ___ + ____ + ___ + ____ = 12.
Thus, the total time needed by the four fountains to fill the cistern 
together is 1
12 days.

A Dramma-tic Donation
The 
following 
problem 
is 
translated 
from 
Bhāskarāchārya’s  
(Bhāskara II’s) book, Līlāvatī, written in 1150 CE. 
“O wise one! A miser gave to a beggar 1
5 of 1
16 of 1
4 of  1
2 of 2
3 of 3
4 of 
a dramma. If you know the mathematics of fractions well, tell me O 
child, how many cowrie shells were given by the miser to the beggar.”
Dramma refers to a silver coin used in those times. The tale says that 
1 dramma was equivalent to 1280 cowrie shells. Let’s see what fraction 
of a dramma the person gave:
(
1
2 × 2
3 × 3
4 × 1
5 × 1
16 × 1
4)
th
 part of a dramma.
193
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Evaluating it gives 
6
7680 . 
Upon simplifying to its lowest form, we get
6
7680 = 
1
1280.
So, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar.
You can see in the answer Bhāskarāchārya’s humour! The miser had 
given the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie).
Around the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in 
different kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used 
were gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called 
drammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and 
cowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied 
depending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of 
coins and their purity. 
Gold coins had high-value and were used in large transactions and 
to store wealth. Silver coins were more commonly used in everyday 
transactions. Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller 
transactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were 
used in very small transactions and as change.
If we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4 
copper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells, 
1 copper pana = 1
48 gold dinar (
1
12 × 1
4)
1 cowrie shell =____ copper panas
1 cowrie shell =____ gold dinar.
A Pinch of History  
As you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing 
a critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing 
and dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions 
as we use them today — equipped with the arithmetic operations of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in 
India. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Śhulbasūtra — which 
go back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction 
of fire altars for rituals — used general non-unit fractions extensively, 
including performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3.
Fractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of 
India as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to 
the reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of 
the revered Jain scholar Umasvati.
194
Working with Fractions
General rules for performing arithmetic operations on fractions — 
in essentially the modern form in which we carry them out today — 
were first codified by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 
628 CE. We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting 
general fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta 
wrote: 
“Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the 
product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.” 
(Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.1.3)
That is,	 	
	
	
	
a
b × c
d = a × c
b × d .
For division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote:
“The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator 
and denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then 
multiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new) 
denominator.”
Bhāskara II in his book Līlāvatī in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s 
statement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal:
“Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of 
the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Līlāvatī, Verse 2.3.40)
Both of these verses are equivalent to the formula: 
a
b ÷ c
d = a
b ×d
c = a × d
b × c .
Bhāskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣhya on 
Aryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the 
geometric interpretation of multiplication 
of fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms 
of the division of a square into rectangles 
via equal divisions along the length and 
breadth. 
Many 
other 
Indian 
mathematicians, 
such as Śhrīdharāchārya (c. 750 CE), 
Mahāvīrāchārya (c. 850 CE), Caturveda 
Pṛithūdakasvāmī (c. 860 CE), and Bhāskara II 
(c. 1150 CE) developed the usage of arithmetic 
of fractions significantly further. 
The Indian theory of fractions and 
arithmetic operations on them was 
transmitted to, and its usage developed further, by Arab and African 
mathematicians such as al-Hassâr (c. 1192 CE) of Morocco. The theory 
was then transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few 
Bhāskara I’s visual explanation that

indispensable today in modern mathematics.

Chess Puzzles —  
Non-attacking Queens
Chess is a popular 2-player strategy game. This game has its origins 
in India. It is played on an 8 × 8 chequered grid. There are 2 sets of 
pieces — black and white — one set for each player. Find out how 
each piece should move and the rules of the game.
Here is a famous chess-based puzzle. From its current position, 
a Queen piece can move along the horizontal, vertical or diagonal. 
Place 4 Queens such that no 2 queens attack each other. For example, 
the arrangement below is not valid as the queens are in the line of 
attack of each other.
Now, place 8 queens on this 8 × 8 grid so that no 2 queens attack

PARALLEL AND 
INTERSECTING 
LINES

5.1 Across the Line
Take a piece of square paper and fold it in different ways. Now, on 
the creases formed by the folds, draw lines using a pencil and a scale. 
You will notice different lines on the paper. Take any pair of lines and 
observe their relationship with each other. Do they meet? If they do 
not meet within the paper, do you think they would meet if they were 
extended beyond the paper?
Fig. 5.1
In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between lines on a 
plane surface. The table top, your piece of paper, the blackboard, and 
the bulletin board are all examples of plane surfaces.
Let us observe a pair of lines that meet each other. You will notice 
that they meet at a point. When a pair of lines meet each other at a 
point on a plane surface, we say that the lines intersect each other.
Let us observe what happens when two lines intersect.
How many angles do they form? 
In Fig. 5.2, where line l intersects line m, we can see that four angles 
are formed.

Can two straight lines intersect at more than one point?
Activity 1
Draw two lines on a plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure 
the four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of 
intersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of 
intersection.
What patterns do you observe among these angles?
In Fig. 5.2, if ∠a is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of ∠b, ∠c 
and ∠d, without drawing and measuring them?
We know that ∠a and ∠b together measure 180°, because when they 
are combined, they form a straight angle which measures 180°. So, if 
∠a is 120°, then ∠b must be 60°.
Similarly, ∠b and ∠c together measure 180°. So, if ∠b is 60°, then ∠c 
must be 120°. And ∠c and ∠d together measure 180°. So, if ∠c is 120°, 
then ∠d must be 60°.
Therefore, in Fig. 5.2, ∠a and ∠c measure 120°, and ∠b and ∠d 
measure 60°.
When two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled 
a, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then ∠a and ∠c are equal, and ∠b and ∠d 
are equal!
Is this always true for any pair of intersecting lines?
Check this for different measures of ∠a. Using these measurements, 
can you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of ∠a?
We can generalise our reasoning for Fig. 5.2, without assuming the 
values of ∠a.
Since straight angles measure 180°, we must have ∠a + ∠b = ∠a + ∠d 
= 180°. Hence, ∠b and ∠d are always equal. Similarly, ∠b + ∠a = ∠b + 
∠c = 180°, so ∠a and ∠c must be equal.  
Adjacent angles, like ∠a and ∠b, formed by two lines intersecting 
each other, are called linear pairs. Linear pairs always add up to 180°.
107
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Opposite angles, like ∠b and ∠d, formed by two lines intersecting 
each other, are called vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite 
angles are always equal to each other.
From the above reasoning, we conclude that whenever two lines 
intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. Such a justification is 
called a proof in mathematics.
Figure it Out
List all the linear pairs and vertically opposite angles you 
observe in Fig. 5.3:

Opposite Angles

Measurements and Geometry
You might have noticed that when you measure linear pairs, sometimes 
they may not add up to 180°. Or, when you measure vertically opposite 
angles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this?
There could be different reasons:
•	 Measurement errors because of improper use of measuring 
instruments — in this case, a protractor
•	 Variation in the thickness of the lines drawn. The “ideal” line in 
geometry does not have any thickness! But it is not possible for us 
to draw lines without any thickness
In geometry, we create ideal versions of “lines” and other shapes 
we see around us, and analyse the relationships between them. For 
example, we know that the angle formed by a straight line is 180°. 
So, if another line divides this angle into two parts, both parts should 
add up to 180°. We arrive at this simply through reasoning and not 
by measurement. When we measure, it might not be exactly so, for 
the reasons mentioned above. Still the measurements come out very 
close to what we predict, because of which geometry finds widespread 
application in different disciplines such as physics, art, engineering 
and architecture.
5.2 Perpendicular Lines
Can you draw a pair of intersecting lines such that all four angles are 
equal? Can you figure out what will be the measure of each angle?

If two lines intersect and all four angles are equal, then each angle 
must be a right angle (90°).
Perpendicular lines are a pair of lines which intersect each other 
at right angles (90°). In Fig. 5.4, we can say that lines l and m are 
perpendicular to each other.
5.3 Between Lines
Observe Fig. 5.5 and describe the way the line segments meet or cross 
each other in each case, with appropriate mathematical words (a point, 
an endpoint, the midpoint, meet, intersect) and the degree measure of 
each angle.
For example, line segments FG and FH meet at the endpoint F at an 
angle 115.3°.

109
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
What is common to the lines in the pictures above? They do not seem 
likely to intersect each other. Such lines are called parallel lines.
Parallel lines are a pair of lines that lie on the same plane, and do 
not meet however far we extend them at both ends.
Name some parallel lines you can spot in your classroom.
Parallel lines are often used in artwork and shading.

drawn on a table and a line drawn on the board may never meet but that does 
not make them parallel.

Activity 2
Take a plain square sheet of paper (use a newspaper for this activity). 
•	 How would you describe the opposite edges of the sheet? They 
are _________________________ to each other.
•	 How would you describe the adjacent edges of the sheet? The 
adjacent edges are _________________________ to each other. They 
meet at a point. They form right angles.
•	 Fold the sheet horizontally in half. A new line is formed  
(see Fig. 5.7).
•	 How many parallel lines do you see now? How does the new line 
segment relate to the vertical sides?
Fig. 5.7
•	 Make one more horizontal fold in the folded sheet. How many 
parallel lines do you see now?
•	 What will happen if you do it once more? How many parallel 
lines will you get? Is there a pattern? Check if the pattern extends 
further, if you make another horizontal fold.
•	 Make a vertical fold in the square sheet. This new vertical line is 
___________ to the previous horizontal lines.
•	 Fold the sheet along a diagonal. Can you find a fold that creates a 
line parallel to the diagonal line?
111
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Here is another activity for you to try.
•	 Take a square sheet of paper, fold it in the middle and unfold it.
•	 Fold the edges towards the centre line and unfold them.
•	 Fold the top right and bottom left corners onto the creased line to 
create triangles. Refer to Fig. 5.8.
•	 The triangles should not cross the crease lines.
•	 Are a, b and c parallel to p, q and r respectively? Why or why not?

Notations
In mathematics, we use an arrow mark (>) to show that a set of lines is 
parallel. If there is more than one set of parallel lines (as in Fig. 5. 9), the 
second set is shown with two arrow marks and so on. Perpendicular 
lines are marked with a square angle between them.

Note to the Teacher: It is easier to draw vertical and horizontal lines and the 
ones inclined at 45° (on rectangular dot sheets), but drawing a line parallel to 
one which has a different orientation is slightly harder. Let students use their 
intuition for this.
From previous exercises we observed that sometimes it is difficult 
to be sure whether two lines are parallel. To determine this we use the 
idea of transversals.

5.5 Transversals
We saw what happens when two lines intersect in different ways. Let 
us explore what happens when one line intersects two different lines.

m
Fig. 5.14
In Fig. 5.14, line t intersects lines l and m. t is called a transversal. 
Notice that 8 angles are formed when a line crosses a pair of lines.
Is it possible for all the eight angles to have different measurements? 
Why, why not?
What about five different angles — 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2?
In Fig. 5.14, since ∠1 and ∠3 are vertically opposite angles,  they are 
equal. Are there other pairs of vertically opposite angles? We can see 
that there are a total of four pairs of vertically opposite angles and in 
each pair, the angles are equal to each other.
Thus, when a transversal intersects two lines, it forms eight angles 
with a maximum of four distinct angle measures.
5.6 Corresponding Angles
In Fig. 5.14, we notice that the transversal t forms two sets of angles — 
one with line l and another with line m. There are angles in the first set 
that  correspond to angles in the second set based on their position. ∠1 
and ∠5 are called corresponding angles. Similarly, ∠2 and ∠6, ∠3 and 
∠7, ∠4 and ∠8 are the corresponding angles formed when transversal 
t intersects lines l and m.
Activity 3
Draw a pair of lines and a transversal such that they form two 
distinct angles.
115
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Step 1: Draw a line l and a transversal t intersecting it at point X.
Fig. 5.15

l
t
 
Step 2: Measure ∠a formed by lines l and t (let us say it is 60°).
 
a = 60°
l
X
t
Fig. 5.16
How many distinct angles have formed now?
If one angle is 60°, the other angle of the linear pair should be 120°. 
So, we already have two distinct angles.
So, when we draw another line intersecting the transversal t we 
wish to form only two angles, 60° and 120°. 
Step 3: Mark a point Y on line t.
a = 60°
l
X
t
Y
Fig. 5.17
Step 4: Draw a line m through point Y that forms a 60° angle to line t. 
This can be done either by copying ∠a with a tracing paper or you can 
use a protractor to measure the angles.
 
a = 60°
b = 60°

Y
Fig. 5.18
What do you observe about lines l and m? Do they appear to be 
parallel to each other?
Yes, they do appear to be parallel to each other.
Angles, ∠a and ∠b are corresponding angles formed by the transversal 
t on lines l and m. These corresponding angles are equal to each other.
116
Parallel and Intersecting Lines
From this we can observe:
When the corresponding angles formed by a transversal on a pair 
of lines are equal to each other, then the pair of lines are parallel 
to each other.
Suppose, we have a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. What 
can be said about the corresponding angles?
Activity 4
Fig. 5.19 has a pair of parallel lines l and m (what is the notation used 
in the figure to indicate they are parallel?) . Line t is the transversal 
across these two lines. ∠a and ∠b are corresponding angles. Take a 
tracing paper and trace ∠a on it. Now place this tracing paper over 
∠b and see if the angles align exactly. You will observe that the angles 
match. Check the other corresponding angles in the figure using a 
protractor. Are all the corresponding angles equal to each other?
l
a

t
Fig. 5.19
Corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair 
of parallel lines are always equal to each other.
Activity 5
In Fig. 5.20, draw a transversal t to the lines l and m such that one pair 
of corresponding angles is equal. You can measure the angles with a 
protractor.
l
m
Fig. 5.20
Are you finding it hard to draw a transversal such that the 
corresponding angles are equal?
117
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
When a pair of lines are not parallel to each other, the corresponding 
angles formed by a transversal can never be equal to each other.
5.7 Drawing Parallel Lines
Can you draw a pair of parallel lines using a ruler and a set square?
Fig. 5.21 shows how you can do it.
Draw a line l with a scale. By sliding your set square you can make 
two lines perpendicular to line l.
Are these two lines parallel to each other? How are we sure that they 
are parallel to each other? What angles are formed between these lines 
and line l?
l
Fig. 5.21
Since we used a set square, the angles measure 90°. The position 
of the lines is different, but they make the same angle with l. If line l 
is seen as a transversal to the two new lines, then the corresponding 
angles measure 90°.
Fig. 5.22
l
As we know these are corresponding angles and they are equal, we 
can be sure that the lines are parallel.
Draw two more parallel lines using the long side of the set square as 
shown in Fig. 5.22.
118
Parallel and Intersecting Lines
How do you know these two lines are parallel? Can you check if the 
corresponding angles are equal?
Note to the Teacher: Students should be encouraged to check the equality of 
corresponding angles both by using the tracing method and using protractors to 
measure the angles. Pay attention to the language used to make the relationship 
between corresponding angles and parallel lines. Equality of corresponding 
angles is both necessary and sufficient for the pair of lines to be parallel to 
each other.
Figure it Out
Can you draw a line parallel to l, that goes through point A? How will 
you do it with the tools from your geometry box? Describe your method.

Making Parallel Lines through Paper Folding
Let us try to do the same with paper folding. For a line l (given as a 
crease), how do we make a line parallel to l such that it passes through 
point A?
We know how to fold a piece of paper to get a line perpendicular to l. 
Now, try to fold a perpendicular to l such that it passes through point 
A. Let us call this new crease t.
Now, fold a line perpendicular to t passing through A again. Let us 
call this line m. The lines l and m are parallel to each other.

5.8 Alternate Angles
In Fig. 5.25, ∠d is called the alternate angle of ∠f, and ∠c is the alternate 
angle of ∠e. 
a

d
c

g

f
Fig. 5.25
You can find the alternate angle of a given angle, say ∠f, by first 
finding the corresponding angle of ∠f, which is ∠b and then finding the 
vertically opposite angle of ∠b, which is ∠d.
Activity 6
In Fig. 5.25, if ∠f is 120° what is the measure of its alternate angle ∠d?
We can find the measure of ∠d if we know ∠b because they are 
vertically opposite angles. Remember, vertically opposite angles are 
equal.
What is the measure of ∠b? It is 120° because it is the corresponding 
angle of ∠f.
So, ∠d also measures 120°.
In fact, ∠f = ∠b irrespective of the measure of ∠f. Why? Because ∠b 
is the corresponding angle of ∠f.
Similarly, ∠b = ∠d irrespective of the measure of ∠b. Why? Because 
∠d is the vertically opposite angle of ∠b. So, it must always be the 
case that
∠f = ∠d
Using our understanding of corresponding angles without any 
measurements, we have justified that alternate angles are always equal.
Alternate angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair of 
parallel lines are always equal to each other.
Example 1: In Fig. 5.26, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the 
transversal t. If ∠6 is 135°, what are the measures of the other angles?

1
Fig. 5.26
Solution: ∠6 is 135°, so ∠2 is also 135°, because it is the corresponding 
angle of ∠6 and the lines l and m are parallel. 
∠8 is 135°, because it is the vertically opposite angle of ∠6. ∠4 is 135° 
because it is the corresponding angle of ∠8.
∠2 is 135° because is the vertically opposite angle of ∠4. So, ∠2, ∠4, 
∠6, and ∠8 are all 135°.
∠5 and ∠6 are a linear pair, together they measure 180°. If ∠6 is 
135°, then
∠5 = 180 – 135 = 45°
We can similarly find out that ∠1, ∠3, and ∠7 measure 45°.
Example 2: In Fig. 5.27, lines l and m are intersected by the transversal 
t. If ∠a is 120° and ∠f is 70°, are lines l and m parallel to each other?

120°
70°
Fig. 5.27
Solution: ∠a is 120°, so ∠b is 60° because ∠a and ∠b form a linear pair.
∠b is a corresponding angle of ∠f. If l and m are parallel, ∠b should be 
equal to ∠f, however, they are not equal.
Therefore, lines l and m are not parallel to each other as the corresponding 
angles formed by the transversal t are not equal to each other.
Example 3: In Fig. 5.28, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the 
transversal t. If ∠3 is 50°, what is the measure of ∠6?

121
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Solution: ∠3 is 50°; therefore, ∠2 is 130°, because ∠2 and ∠3 form a 
linear pair, and linear pairs always add up to 180°.
∠2 and ∠6 are corresponding angles, and they need to be equal since 
lines l and m are parallel.
So, ∠6 is 130°.
Angles ∠3 and ∠6 are called interior angles.
 
Is there a relation between ∠3 and ∠6? You could try to find the 
relationship by taking different values for ∠3 and see what ∠6 is. 
Once you find a relation, try to justify it or prove that this relation 
holds always. You will find that the sum of the interior angles on 
the same side of the transversal always add up to 180°.
Example 4: In Fig. 5.29, line segment AB is parallel to CD and AD is 
parallel to BC. ∠DAC is 65° and ∠ADC is 60°. What are the measures of 
angles ∠CAB, ∠ABC, and ∠BCD?
Solution: Let us observe the parallel lines AB and CD. AD is a 
transversal of these two lines.	
65°
60°
A
B
C
D
Fig. 5.29
We know that the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal 
on a pair of parallel lines adds up to 180°. So
∠ADC + ∠DAB = 180° 
60° + ∠DAB = 180°. 
So ∠DAB = 120°.
Can we find ∠CAB from this?
∠DAB = ∠DAC + ∠CAB. 
So 120° = 65° + ∠CAB.
So ∠CAB = 55°.
Let us observe the parallel line segments AD and BC. They are 
intersected by a transversal CD. So, ∠ADC + ∠BCD = 180°, because they 
are interior angles on the same side of the transversal. Since ∠ADC is 
given as 60°, ∠BCD = 120°
Similarly, we find ∠ABC = 60°.
Therefore, in Fig. 5.29, ∠CAB = 55°, ∠ABC = 60°, and ∠BCD = 120°.

5.9 Parallel Illusions
There do not seem to be any parallel lines here. Or, are there?
 	
 What causes these illusions?
125
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
•	 When two lines intersect, they form four angles. The vertically 
opposite angles are equal and the linear pairs add up to 180°.
•	 When two lines intersect and the angles formed are 90° (i.e., all four 
angles are equal), the lines are said to be perpendicular to each other.
•	 When two lines never intersect on a plane, they are called parallel 
lines.
•	 When a line t intersects another pair of lines, it is called a transversal 
and it forms 2 sets of 4 angles. Each of the 4 angles in the first set has 
a corresponding angle in the second set.
•	 When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the 
corresponding angles are equal. When a transversal intersects a pair 
of lines and the corresponding angles are equal, then the pair of lines 
is parallel.
•	 When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the alternate 
angles are equal.
•	 The interior angles on the same side formed by a transversal 
intersecting a pair of parallel lines always add up to 180°.

Remember the children from the Grade 6 textbook of mathematics? 
Now, they call out numbers using a different rule.

based on the new arrangement.
Could you figure out what these numbers convey? Observe and try to 
find out.

them who are taller than them. Check if the number each child says 
matches this rule in both the arrangements.

6.2 Picking Parity
Kishor has some number cards and is working on a puzzle: There 
are 5 boxes, and each box should contain exactly 1 number card. The 
numbers in the boxes should sum to 30. Can you help him find a way 
to do it?

Can you figure out which 5 cards add to 30? Is it possible? 
There are many ways of choosing 5 cards from this collection. 
Is there a way to find a solution without checking all possibilities? 
Let us find out.
Add a few even numbers together. What kind of number do you get? 
Does it matter how many numbers are added?
Any even number can be arranged in pairs without any leftovers. 
Some even numbers are shown here, arranged in pairs.
 
As we see in the figure, adding any number of even numbers
will result in a number which can still be arranged in pairs 
without any leftovers. In other words, the sum will always be an 
even number.
Now, add a few odd numbers together. What kind of number do you 
get? Does it matter how many odd numbers are added?
Odd numbers can not be arranged in pairs. An odd number is one 
more than a collection of pairs. Some odd numbers are shown below:
 
129
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Can we also think of an odd number as one less than a collection 
of pairs?
This figure shows that the sum of two odd numbers must always 
be even! This along with the other figures here are more examples 
of a proof!
We can see that 
two odd numbers added 
together can always be 
arranged in pairs.
What about adding 3 odd numbers? Can the resulting sum be arranged 
in pairs? No. 
Explore what happens to the sum of (a) 4 odd numbers, (b) 5 odd 
numbers, and (c) 6 odd numbers.
Let us go back to the puzzle Kishor was trying to solve. There are 
5 empty boxes. That means he has an odd number of boxes. All the 
number cards contain odd numbers.
They should add to 30, which is an even number. Since, adding any 
5 odd numbers will never result in an even number, Kishor cannot 
arrange these cards in the boxes to add up to 30.
Two siblings, Martin and Maria, were born exactly one year apart. 
Today they are celebrating their birthday. Maria exclaims that the sum 
of their ages is 112. Is this possible? Why or why not?
As they were born one year apart, their ages will be (two) consecutive 
numbers. Can their ages be 51 and 52? 51 + 52 = 103.  Try some other 
consecutive numbers and see if their sum is 112.
The counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... alternate between even and odd 
numbers. In any two consecutive numbers, one will always be even 
and the other will always be odd!
What would be the resulting sum of an even number and an odd 
number? We can see that their sum can’t be arranged in pairs and thus 
will be an odd number.
130
Number Play
Since 112 is an even number, and Martin’s and Maria’s ages are 
consecutive numbers, they cannot add up to 112.
We use the word parity to denote the property of being even or odd. 
For instance, the parity of the sum of any two consecutive numbers is 
odd. Similarly, the parity of the sum of any two odd numbers is even.
Figure it Out
1.	 Using your understanding of the pictorial representation of odd 
and even numbers, find out the parity of the following sums:
(a)	 Sum of 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers (e.g., even + even 
+ odd + odd)
(b)	 Sum of 2 odd numbers and 3 even numbers
(c)	 Sum of 5 even numbers
(d)	 Sum of 8 odd numbers
2.	 Lakpa has an odd number of ₹1 coins, an odd number of ₹5 coins 
and an even number of ₹10 coins in his piggy bank. He calculated 
the total and got ₹205. Did he make a mistake? If he did, explain 
why. If he didn’t, how many coins of each type could he have?
3.	 We know that:
(a)	 even + even	 = even
(b)	 odd + odd	
= even
(c)	 even + odd	 = odd
Similarly, find out the parity for the scenarios below:
(d)	 even – even	 =  ___________________

Small Squares in Grids
In a 3 × 3 grid, there are 9 small squares, 
which is an odd number. Meanwhile, in 
a 3 × 4 grid, there are 12 small squares, 
which is an even number.
Given the dimensions of a grid, can you 
tell the parity of the number of small 
squares without calculating the product?

Come up with expressions that always have odd parity.
Come up with other expressions, like 3n + 4, which could have either 
odd or even parity.
The expression 6k + 2 evaluates to 8, 14, 20,... (for k = 1, 2, 3,...) — many 
even numbers are missing. 
Are there expressions using which we can list all the even numbers?
Hint: All even numbers have a factor 2.
Are there expressions using which we can list all odd numbers?
We saw earlier how to express the nth term of the sequence of 
multiples of 4, where n is the letter-number that denotes a position in 
the sequence (e.g., first, twenty third, hundred and seventeenth, etc.).
What would be the nth term for multiples of 2? Or, what is the nth even 
number?
Let us consider odd numbers.
What is the 100th odd number?
To answer this question, consider the following question:
132
Number Play
What is the 100th even number?
This is 2 × 100 = 200.
Does this help in finding the 100th odd number? Let us compare the 
sequence of evens and odds term-by-term.
Even Numbers:	
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,...
Odd Numbers:	
1, 3, 5, 7,  9,  11,...
We see that at any position, the value at the odd number sequence 
is one less than that in the even number sequence. Thus, the 100th odd 
number is 200 – 1 = 199.
Write a formula to find the nth odd number.
Let us first describe the method that we have learnt to find the odd 
number at a given position:
(a)	 Find the even number at that position. This is 2 times the 
position number. 
(b)	 Then subtract 1 from the even number.
Writing this in expressions, we get
(a)	 2n
(b)	 2n – 1
Thus, 2n is the formula that gives the nth even number, and 2n – 1 is 
the formula that gives the nth odd number.
6.3 Some Explorations in Grids
Observe this 3 × 3 grid. It is filled following a simple 
rule — use numbers from 1 – 9 without repeating 
any of them. There are circled numbers outside the 
grid.
Are you able to see what the circled numbers 
represent?
The numbers in the yellow circles are the sums of the corresponding 
rows and columns.

Make a couple of questions like this on your own and challenge your 
peers.
Try solving the problem below.
You might have realised that it is not possible to 
find a solution for this grid. Why is this the case?
The smallest sum possible is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. The 
largest sum possible is 24 = 9 + 8 + 7. Clearly, any 
number in a circle cannot be less than 6 or 
greater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26. 
Therefore, this is impossible!
In the earlier grids which we solved, 
Kishor noticed that the sum of all the 
numbers in the circles was always 90. Also, 
Vidya observed that the sum of the circled 
numbers for all three rows, or for all three 
columns, was always 45. Check if this is true 
in the previous grids you have solved.
Why should the row sums and column sums 
always add to 45?
From this grid, we can see that all the 
row sums added together will be the same 
as the sum of the numbers 1 – 9. This can be 
seen for column sums as well. The sum of 
the numbers 1 – 9 is
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.
A square grid of numbers is called a 
magic square if each row, each column and 
each diagonal, add up to the same number. 
This number is called the magic sum. 
Diagonals are shown in the picture.   
Trying to create a magic square by randomly filling 
the grid with numbers may be difficult! This is because 
there are a large number of ways of filling a 3 × 3 grid 
using the numbers 1 – 9 without repetition. In fact, it 
can be found that there are exactly 3,62,880 such ways. 
Surprisingly, the number of ways to fill in the grid can be 
found without listing all of them. We will see in later years how to do this.
Instead, we should proceed systematically to make a magic square. 
For this, let us ask ourselves some questions.
1.	 What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number?

Let us focus, for the moment, only on the row sums. We have seen that 
in a 3 × 3 grid with numbers 1 – 9, the total of row sums will always be 
45. Since in a magic square the row sums are all equal, and they add up 
to 45, they have to be 15 each. Thus, we have the following observation.
Observation 1: In a magic square made using the numbers 1 – 9, the 
magic sum must be 15.
2.	 What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a 
magic square?
Let us consider the possibilities one by one. 
Can the central number be 9? If yes, then 8 must 
come in one of the other squares. For example,
In this, we must have 8 + 9 + other number = 15.
But this is not possible! The same issue will 
occur no matter where we place 8.
So, 9 cannot be at the centre. Can the central 
number be 1?
If yes, then 2 should come in one of the other 
squares. 
Here, we must have 2 + 1 + other number = 15.
But this is not possible because we are only 
using the numbers 1 – 9. The same issue will 
occur no matter where we place 1.
So, 1 cannot be at the centre, either.
Using such reasoning, find out which other 
numbers 1 – 9 cannot occur at the centre.
This exploration will lead us to the following 
interesting observation.
Observation 2: The number occurring at 
the centre of a magic square, filled using 1 – 9, 
must be 5.
Let us now see where the smallest number 1 
and the largest number 9 should come in a magic 
square. Our second observation tells us that 
they will have to come in one of the boundary 
positions. Let us classify these positions into two categories:  
8
9
1
2
5
135
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Can 1 occur in a corner position? For example,
can it be placed as follows?
If yes, then there should exist three ways of 
adding 1 with two other numbers to give 15. 
We have 1 + 5 + 9 = 1 + 6 + 8 = 15. Is any other 
combination possible?
Similarly, can 9 can be placed in a corner position?
Observation 3: The numbers 1 and 9 cannot occur in any corner, so 
they should occur in one of the middle positions.
Can you find the other possible positions for 1 and 9?
Now, we have one full row or column of the magic square!
Try completing it! 
[Hint: First fill the row or columns containing 1 and 9]
Figure it Out
1.	 How many different magic squares can be made using the 
numbers 1 – 9? 
2.	 Create a magic square using the numbers 2 – 10. What strategy 
would you use for this? Compare it with the magic squares 
made using 1 – 9.
3.	 Take a magic square, and 
(a)	 increase each number by 1
(b)	 double each number
In each case, is the resulting grid also a magic square? How do the 
magic sums change in each case?
4.	 What other operations can be performed on a magic square to 
yield another magic square?
5.	 Discuss ways of creating a magic square using any set of 9 
consecutive numbers (like 2 – 10, 3 – 11, 9 – 17, etc.).  
Generalising a 3 × 3 Magic Square

Magic Squares in History and Culture
The first magic square ever recorded, the Lo Shu Square, dates 
back over 2000 years to ancient China. The legend tells of a 
catastrophic flood on the Lo River, during which the gods sent 
a turtle to save the people. The turtle carried a 3 × 3 
grid on its back, with the numbers 1 to 9 arranged in 
a magical pattern.
Magic squares were studied in different parts of 
the world at different points of time including India, Japan, 
Central Asia, and Europe.
Indian mathematicians have worked extensively on magic 
squares, describing general methods of constructing them. 
The work of Indian mathematicians was not just limited to 3 × 3 and 
4 × 4 grids, which we considered above, but also extended to 5 × 5 and 
other larger square grids. We shall learn more about these in 
later grades.
The occurrence of magic squares is not limited to scholarly 
mathematical works. They are found in many places in India. 
The picture to the right is of a 3 × 3 magic square found on 
a pillar in a temple in Palani, Tamil Nadu. The temple dates 
back to the 8th century CE.
3 × 3 magic squares can also be found in homes and shops in 
India. The Navagraha Yantra is one such example shown below.

6.4 Nature’s Favourite Sequence: The Virahāṅka–
Fibonacci Numbers!
The sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . .  (Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers) 
is one of the most celebrated sequences in all of mathematics — it 
occurs throughout the world of Art, Science, and Mathematics. Even 
though these numbers are found very frequently in Science, it is 
remarkable that these numbers were first discovered in the context of 
Art (specifically, poetry)! 
The Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers thus provide a beautiful 
illustration of the close links between Art, Science, and Mathematics.
Discovery of the Virahāṅka Numbers
The Virahāṅka numbers first came up thousands of years ago in the 
works of Sanskrit and Prakrit linguists in their study of poetry!
In the poetry of many Indian languages, including, Prakrit, Sanskrit, 
Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, each syllable is classified as 
either long or short. 
A long syllable is pronounced for a longer duration than a short 
syllable — in fact, for exactly twice as long. When singing such a poem, 
a short syllable lasts one beat of time, and a long syllable lasts two 
beats of time.
This leads to numerous mathematical questions, which the ancient 
poets in these languages considered extensively. A number of important 
mathematical discoveries were made in the process of asking and 
answering these questions about poetry. 
One of these particularly important questions was the following.
How many rhythms are there with 8 beats consisting of short syllables 
(1 beat) and long syllables (2 beats)? That is, in how many ways can one

Here are some possibilities:

short short short short short short short short
short long long short long
long long short short long
	
      .
	
      .
	
      .
Can you find others?
Phrased more mathematically: In how many different ways can one 
write a number, say 8, as a sum of 1’s and 2’s?
For example, we have:
	
	
	
	
	
8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2,
	
	
	
	
	
8 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1,
	
	
	
	
	
8 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2,
	
	
	
	
	
8 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2,
	
	
	
	
	
etc.
Do you see other ways?
Here are all the ways of writing each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
as the sum of 1’s and 2’s.

Try writing the number 5 as a sum of 1s and 2s in all possible ways 
in your notebook! How many ways did you find? (You should find 8 
different ways!) Can you figure out the answer without listing down all 
the possibilities? Can you try it for n = 8? 
Here is a systematic way to write down all rhythms of short and long 
syllables having 5 beats. Write a ‘1+’ in front of all rhythms having 4 
beats, and then a ‘2+’ in front of all rhythms having 3 beats. This gives 
us all the rhythms having 5 beats:     
140
Number Play
n = 5
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 2
1 + 1 + 2 + 1
1 + 2 + 1 + 1
1 + 2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 2
2 + 2 + 1
Thus, there are 8 rhythms having 5 beats!
The reason this method works is that every 5-beat rhythm must begin 
with either a ‘1+’ or a ‘2+’. If it begins with a ‘1+’, then the remaining 
numbers must give a 4-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. 
If it begins with a 2+, then the remaining number must give a 3-beat 
rhythm, and we can write all those down. Therefore, the number of 
5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat rhythms, plus the number of 
3-beat rhythms.
How many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will 
be the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms, 
i.e., 8 + 5 = 13. Thus, there are 13 rhythms having 6 beats.
Use the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write 
6 as the sum of 1’s and 2’s in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways?
This beautiful method for counting all the rhythms of short syllables 
and long syllables having any given number of beats was first given by 
the great Prakrit scholar Virahāṅka around the year 700 CE. He gave 
his method in the form of a Prakrit poem! For this reason, the sequence 
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . is known as the Virahāṅka sequence, and 
the numbers in the sequence are known as the Virahāṅka numbers. 
Virahāṅka was the first known person in history to explicitly consider 
these important numbers and write down the rule for their formation.
Other scholars in India also considered these numbers in the 
same poetic context. Virahāṅka was inspired by earlier work of the 
legendary Sanskrit scholar Piṅgala, who lived around 300 BCE. After 
Virahāṅka, these numbers were also written about by Gopala (c. 1135 
CE) and then by Hemachandra (c. 1150 CE).
In the West, these numbers have been known as the Fibonacci 
numbers, after the Italian mathematician who wrote about them in 
the year 1202 CE — about 500 years after Virahāṅka. As we can see, 
Fibonacci was not first, nor the second, not even the third person to 
write about these numbers! Sometimes the term “Virahāṅka–Fibonacci 
numbers” is used so that everyone understands what is being referred 
to.
So, how many rhythms of short and long syllables are there having 
8 beats? We simply take the 8th element of the Virahāṅka sequence:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... 
Thus, there are 34 rhythms having 8 beats.
141
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Write the next number in the sequence, after 55.
We have seen that the next number in the sequence is given by 
adding the two previous numbers. Check that this holds true for the 
numbers given above. The next number is 34 + 55 = 89.
Write the next 3 numbers in the sequence:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 , 55, 89, ____, ____, ____, …
If you have to write one more number in the sequence above, can 
you tell whether it will be an odd number or an even number (without 
adding the two previous numbers)?
What is the parity of each number in the sequence? Do you notice any 
pattern in the sequence of parities?
Today, the Virahāṅka–Fibonacci numbers form the basis of many 
mathematical and artistic theories, from poetry to drumming, to 
visual arts and architecture, to science. Perhaps the most stunning 
occurrences of these numbers are in nature. For example, the number 
of petals on a daisy is generally a Virahāṅka number.
How many petals do you see on each of these flowers?
A daisy with 13 
petals
A daisy with 21 
petals
A daisy with 34 
petals
There

Let us look at one more example shown on the right. 
Here K2 means that the number is a 2-digit number

M correspond to? 
Both the tens place and the units place of the sum have the same

Number Play
In this chapter, we have explored the following:
•	 In the first activity, we saw how to represent information about how 
a sequence of numbers (e.g., height measures) is arranged without 
knowing the actual numbers.
•	 We learnt the notion of parity — numbers that can be arranged in 
pairs (even numbers) and numbers that cannot be arranged in pairs 
(odd numbers).
•	 We learnt how to determine the parity of sums and products.
•	 While exploring sums in grids, we could determine whether filling 
a grid is impossible by looking at the row and column sums. We 
extended this to construct magic squares.
•	 We saw how Virahāṅka numbers were first discovered in history 
through the Arts. The Virahāṅka sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 
55, ... 
•	 We became math-detectives through cryptarithms, where digits are 
replaced by letters.

Let us read
scholar: a 
learned person
I
Doctor Dolittle was sitting in his kitchen talking with the Cat’s-
food-Man who had come to see him with a stomach-ache.
“Why don’t you give up being a people’s doctor, and be an 
animal doctor?” asked the Cat’s-food-Man.
The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out 
at the rain and singing a sailor song to herself. She stopped 
singing and started to listen.
“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-food-Man went on, “you know all 
about animals—much more than what these vets here do. 
That book you wrote—about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t 
read or write myself—my wife, Theodosia, is a scholar, and 
she read your book to me. You might have been a cat yourself. 
You know the way they think.” 
When the Cat’s-food-Man had gone the parrot flew off the 
window on to the Doctor’s table and said, “That man’s got 
sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal doctor. Give 
the silly people up—if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re 
the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—
they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal doctor.”
“Oh, there are plenty of animal doctors,” said John Dolittle, 
putting the flowerpots outside on the windowsill to get the 
rain.
“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are 
any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. 
Did you know that animals can talk?”
“I knew that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.
“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages—people’s language 
and bird language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly 
wants a cracker’, you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oi-
ee, fee-fee?”
“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”
“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’—in bird language.”
“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that 
way to me before.”
“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting 
some cracker crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have 
understood me if I had.”
“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he 
rushed over to the drawer and came back with a book and 
a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down.
This is interesting—very interesting—something quite new. 
Give me the Birds’ A.B.C. first—slowly now.”
So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals 
had a language of their own and could talk to one 
another. And all that afternoon, while it was 
raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table 
giving him bird words to put down in the 
book.
At teatime, when the dog, Jip, came in, 
the parrot said to the Doctor, “See, he’s 
talking to you.”
“Looks to me as though he were 
scratching his ear,” said the Doctor.
“But animals don’t always speak 
with their mouths,” said the parrot 
in a high voice, raising her eyebrows. 
“They talk with their ears, with their 
feet, with their tails—with everything. 
Sometimes they don’t want to make a

noise. Do you see now the way he’s twitching up one side of his 
nose?”
“What’s that mean?” asked the Doctor.
“That means, ‘Can’t you see that it has stopped raining?’” 
Polynesia answered. “He is asking you a question. Dogs nearly 
always use their noses for asking questions.”
After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the 
language of the animals so well that he could talk to them himself 
and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a 
people’s doctor altogether.
Let us discuss

	 Doctor Dolittle reacts to Polynesia’s information about animal languages 
with both excitement and ____________ (certainty/curiosity). He rushes 
to ____________ (write/memorise) the bird words she provides and is 
interested in learning more.
	III	 Do you think Doctor Dolittle would be famous as an animal doctor? 
If yes, why? If not, why not?
II
As soon as the Cat’s-food-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle 
was going to become an animal doctor, old ladies began to bring 
him their pet pugs and poodles who had eaten too much cake; 
and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.
One day a plough horse was brought to him; and the poor thing 
was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse language.
“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows 
nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now—for 
something or the other. What I need is spectacles. I am going 
blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear 
glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill 
never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills. 
I tried to tell him, but he couldn’t understand a word of horse 
language. What I need is spectacles.”
“Of course—of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”
“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse—“only green. 
They’ll keep the Sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the field.”
“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”
“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough horse as the 
Doctor opened the front door to let him out—“the trouble is that 
anybody thinks he can doctor animals—just because the animals 
don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man 
to be a really good animal doctor than it does to be a good people’s 
doctor.”
“Well, well!” said the Doctor.
“When will my glasses be ready?”
47
Wit and Humour
Poorvi
Then John Dolittle got a fine, big pair of green spectacles; and 
the plough horse stopped going blind in one eye and could see 
as well as ever.
And soon it became a common sight to see farm animals 
wearing glasses in the countryside, round Puddleby; and a 
blind horse was a thing unknown.
And so it was with all the other animals that were brought to 
him. As soon as they found that he could talk their language, 
they told him where the pain was and how they felt, and of 
course it was easy for him to cure them.
Now all these animals went back and told their brothers and 
friends that there was a doctor in the little house with the big 
garden who really was a doctor. And whenever any creatures 
got sick—not only horses and cows and dogs—but all the little 
things of the fields, like harvest mice, badgers, and bats, all 
came at once to his house on the edge of the town, so that his 
big garden was nearly always crowded with animals trying to 
get in to see him.
There were so many that came that he had to have special 
doors made for the different kinds. He wrote ‘HORSES’ over 
countryside:

the front door, ‘COWS’ over the side door, and ‘SHEEP’ on the 
kitchen door. Each kind of animal had a separate door—even 
the mice had a tiny tunnel made for them into the cellar, where 
they waited patiently in rows for the Doctor to come round 
to them.
And so, in a few years’ time, every living thing for miles and 
miles got to know about John Dolittle, M.D. And the birds who 
flew to other countries in the winter told the animals in foreign 
lands about Dolittle who could understand their talk and help 
them in their troubles. In this way he became famous among 
the animals—all over the world. He was happy and liked his 
life very much.

One day a funny kind of man 
Came walking down this street 
He wore a shoe upon his head 
And hats upon his feet.
He raised the shoe and smiled at me, 
His manners were polite; 
But never had I seen before 
Such a funny sounding sight.
He said, “Allow me to present 
Your Highness with a rose.” 
And taking out a currant bun 
He held it to my nose.
I staggered back against the wall 
And then I answered, “Well! 
I never saw a rose with such 
A funny looking smell.”
He then began to sing a song, 
And sat down on the ground; 
You never heard in all your life 
Such a funny feeling sound.
“My friend, why do you wear two hats 
Upon your feet?” I said. 
He turned the other way about, 
And hopped home on his head.

Let us learn
Read the following phrases from the poem.
	 •	 walking down	
•	 taking out	
•	 sat down
These are phrasal verbs. 
Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb with a preposition or 
adverb that together function as a single unit. They often have 
meanings that are different from the individual words used alone. 
The same verb followed by different prepositions or adverbs conveys 
different meanings. 
	
	 Now, fill in the blanks with suitable phrasal verbs from the table given  
in I. You may change the tense of the verb, if required.
	
1.	 The new technology is set to _________________ traditional methods of 
communication.
	
2.	 I tried hard to _________________ what the writer wanted to say but 
was unsuccessful.
	
3.	 Arjun decided to _________________ painting as a hobby.

	 The man says, “God, how long is a million years?”
	
	 God replies, “For me, it’s about a minute.”
	
	 The man asks, “How much is a million rupees?”
	
	 God smiles and replies, “It’s less than a rupee for me.”
	
	 The man quickly requests, “God, may I have a rupee?”
	
	 God promptly says, “Wait a minute.”
	
	 Work in pairs and take turns to tell the joke.

1. There was an Old Man with a beard, 
Who said, “It is just as I feared! 
Two Owls and a Hen, 
Four Larks and a Wren, 
Have all built their nests in my beard!”

Now, read another limerick
2. There were two friends in Bengaluru’s lanes, 
One loved books, the other flew planes. 
They’d laugh and they’d play, 
In their own unique way, 
Creating stories and flying in dreams’ trains.
	
	 Remember all limericks have the same rhyme scheme AABBA.

Let us explore
	 I	 In ancient Indian literature and mythology, there are several humorous 
or funny characters who play important roles in the stories. These 
characters often represent wit, humour and mischief while conveying 
deeper moral lessons. Here are a few well-known funny characters:
	
	 	 Tenali Rama	
Birbal	
Mullah Nasruddin 
	
	 	 King Vikramaditya and Betal
	
	 Take any story to read and share it with your classmates and the teacher.
	 II	 We can identify the acts of the funny man with certain modern-
day activities that have playfulness, or unconventional behaviour.  
For example:
	
	 Street Performers or Clowns: Like the funny man in the poem, modern-
day street performers or clowns often dress in unusual ways and do 
unexpected acts to entertain people. 
67
Wit and Humour
	
	 Performance Art or Abstract Theatre: The funny man’s actions, such 
as singing a song and hopping on his head, resemble performance art 
or abstract theatre, where artists break conventional rules to create 
thought-provoking, often humorous experiences.
	
	 Children’s Entertainment and Comedy Shows: The funny man’s behaviour 
is reflected in children’s shows to evoke laughter.
	
	 In these examples, the common theme is humour, imagination, and 
defying logic or expectation, which is exactly what the funny man in the 
poem represents.
	III	 Sukumar Ray, an Indian poet and illustrator, wrote poems in a similar 
style in his book Abol Tabol.
	
	 You may also share a similar poem from your native language with your 
classmates and the teacher.

	IV	 Read and enjoy the poem.
My Lost Pencil
Oh pencil, dear pencil, where have you gone? 
I just had you here a minute at dawn! 
You were sharp and perfect, ready to write, 
Now you’re missing—gone from sight! 
 
Did you roll off my desk? Did you fall to the floor? 
Did someone swipe you for sure? 
It’s always the same, I’ve lost fifty this year, 
By the end of the month, they just disappear! 
 
Next time, I’ll tie you with tape or a string, 
Because losing my pencils is a real thing.

Say the Right Thing
Let us do these activities before we read.
	 I	 Work in pairs and discuss. 
	
1.	 What does ‘Athithi Devo Bhava’ mean?
	
2.	 Why is it important to be polite to guests?
	 II	 Choose the statements that display polite behaviour when you have 
guests at home.
	
1.	 Offer the guests a glass of water.
	
2.	 Enquire about the well-being of the guests.
	
3.	 Ask the guests when they would leave.
	
4.	 Comment critically about the habits of guests.
	
5.	 Accompany the guests to the door when they leave.
	III	 Sometimes you find that a few friends in class are rude while disagreeing 
with each other on certain issues. Work in groups. How would you deal 
with such a situation? Share at least three ways in which you can do this.

Mrs. Harding and Mrs. Lee will soon be here, and 
they don’t want to see that.
Mary	
:	 You’re always telling me to put things away.
Mrs. Shaw	:	 Yes, I am. You leave your clothes all over the house.
Mary	
:	 I’m not a child!
Mrs. Shaw	:	 No, you’re not. So please keep your clothes in your 
own room.
Mary	
:	 Why are those two women coming here? Who’s Mrs. 
Harding?
Mrs. Shaw	:	 She’s the wife of a wealthy man, Mr. Harding. He 
has just bought a big house in Lanfield. They lived in 
London before. She’s coming to have a talk. I met her 
in a shop and asked her to come.
Mary	
:	 Oh, I’ve seen her children. They often come along the 
road. Who’s Mrs. Lee?
Mrs. Shaw	:	 She’s Mr. Harding’s sister. She has been staying with 
them for a while.
Mary	
:	 What are you going to talk about?
Mrs. Shaw	:	 I don’t know. All kinds of things. One day you’ll have 
to go to some of these houses yourself and talk to the 
people there.
Mary	
:	 I can talk now. I’ve been able to talk for a long time.
Mrs. Shaw	:	 Yes, that’s true. You always talk too much. But does 
anyone want to hear the things that you say?
Mary	
:	 I can talk very well when I like. I’ll stay with you 
today and talk to them when they come.
Mrs. Shaw	:	 Oh, I don’t think so. You can go out for a walk. It will 
be better if you do that. 
Mary	
:	 Why?
Mrs. Shaw	:	 If you stay with me, you may not say the right thing.
Mary	
:	 I know the right things to say: “Good afternoon”, 
“How are you?” and things like that. Let me stay 
today. I can do it very well. I’ll show you. Anyone  
can talk.
Wit and Humour
73
Mrs. Shaw	:	 You may stay if you like. But take 
care. I want to know Mrs. Harding 
well. I want her to ask me to go to 
their house. There isn’t much to 
do here in Lanfield, and I want to 
know some more people. I want 
some more friends here. So take 
care when you say anything.
Mary	
:	 Tell me what to say.
Mrs. Shaw	:	 I can’t tell you everything, but 
you’ll always be right if you’re 
kind to people. Say things that 
will please them. Then they’ll like 
you. Laugh a lot, and try to make 
them laugh too. And if everyone stops talking, say 
something to make them talk again. They don’t want 
to sit here and look at the floor without speaking. 
Think of something to say.
Mary	
:	 I can do that. There’s always something to say. Must I 
do anything else?
Mrs. Shaw	:	 When they are ready to leave, don’t jump out of your 
chair and look gladly at the door. You must look sorry 
when they want to leave.
Mary	
:	 What shall I do when they want to go?
Mrs. Shaw	:	 Ask them to stay a little while longer. Just say, “Must 
you go? Can’t you stay?” or something like that. You 
like them and you want them to stay, and you must 
let them understand that.
Mary	
:	 That’s not very hard, is it? I’ll remember that. “Must 
you go? Can’t you stay? Must you go? Can’t you stay?”
Mrs. Shaw	:	 That’s right. Now take your coat to your room 
and change into a clean dress. You must look nice 
when they come. And if everyone stops talking, say 
something kind to make them talk again. And don’t 
say anything that will make them angry. 
Mary	
:	 I will remember. I’ve often done harder things than this.

Mrs. Shaw	
:	 So you like Lanfield, Mrs. Harding! I’m very glad.
Mrs. Harding	:	 Yes, we like it very much. It’s not the same as

here, and we’ve found a good house. (No one says 
anything more, and Mrs. Shaw looks at Mary.)
Mary	
:	 What beautiful children you have, Mrs. Harding! 
I’ve often seen them walking along the road.
Mrs. Harding	:	 Oh, I haven’t any children.
Mary

a little girl.
Mrs. Harding	:	 (not very pleased) I have no children; believe me. 
Mary	
:	 Oh!
Mrs. Shaw	
:	 (quietly) They must be someone else’s children. 
Have you met Mr. Best? He’s a nice man. He lives 
near you.
Mary	
:	 Oh, Mr. Best! He lives here and he works in 
London. He goes all the way to London by train 
every morning, and then he comes all the way 
back by train every night. He lives in trains! (she 
laughs) What kind of life is that? Why do people 
do things like that? They do not know how to live. 
And he reads two newspapers in the train every 
day. He never reads a book. But he’s only a banker, 
and bankers can’t think. 
Mrs. Lee	
:	 My brother’s a banker. He goes to London by train 
every morning and comes back every night. He 
reads two newspapers in the train in the morning, 
and another every night.
Mary	
:	 Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know.
Mrs. Shaw	
:	 Bankers always have to read a lot of newspapers. 
Do you know Mrs. Best? She’s a nice woman. I like 
her.
Mary	
:	 But have you seen her clothes? She goes out in a 
blue dress with a red coat over it. (she laughs)
Poorvi
Mrs. Harding	:	 I have a blue dress, and I often put on my red coat 
at the same time.
Mrs. Shaw	
:	 (quickly) I like blue dresses and red coats. (No one 
says anything.)
Mary	
:	 I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon. I met her in the 
street. No one sees her in the morning because she 
always stays in bed then. And she’s always asking 
the doctor to go to see her. I can’t understand 
women who stay in bed in the morning. And why 
must she always ask for the doctor? I’ve never 
been to a doctor in my life.
Mrs. Harding	:	 I stay in bed in the morning myself.
Mrs. Lee	
:	 I often go to the doctor.
Mary	 :	
Oh, I’m sorry. (No one speaks.)
Mrs. Shaw	 :	
Do you know Mrs. Grantley? She’s 
one of my best friends.
Mary : 	
But she’s so talkative! 
Talkative women aren’t 
very interesting, are they?

very 
talkative woman.
Mary :	 Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

Mary :	 (looking out of the window): 
Oh, there’s that dog again! It 
always looks very dirty. I don’t

keep dogs? Who wants a dog? 
Why doesn’t its owner keep it

horses. He rides a horse every day, and practises 
shooting. Why must he do that? What have they 
done to Mr. Pomeroy? Why do some men like 
horses more than they like people? It’s hard to 
understand men.
Mrs. Lee	
:	 My brother practises shooting when he has the 
time, and he rides his horse when he can. He sold 
his house in London and bought a house here 
because he wanted to ride and practise shooting. 
Mrs. Harding	:	 (looking at Mrs. Lee) It’s getting a little late. We 
must go now, Mrs. Shaw. It has been very nice to 
have a little talk. (She looks at Mary.)

word endings are called suffixes. 
	
•	 humour	
+	 -ous
	
•	 hilarious	 +	 -ly
	
•	 come

(Transcript for the teacher on pg. 89 )
	
1.	 How did the son behave in the grocery queue?
	
(i)

(ii)	impatiently	
(iii)	 politely
	
2.	 The mother finally refers to her son as a __________________.
	
(i)	
polite young man	
(ii)	responsible son	
(iii)	 grateful person
	 II	 You will once again listen to the conversation. As you listen, select four 
true statements from 1– 7 given below.
	
1.	 The mother uses the grocery store incident as an opportunity to teach 
her son about patience and fairness.
	
2.	 The son recognises the value of apologising and understands 	that 
it shows he notices others.
	
3.	 The son is gradually learning the importance of polite words and 
actions from his mother’s guidance.
	
4.	 The mother discourages her son from speaking softly in public, 
suggesting that people should adjust to his voice level.
	
5.	 The son feels that covering his mouth when coughing is only 
important when he’s at home.
	
6.	 The son receives all advice readily while understanding its 
importance.
	
7.	 The mother uses praise to support the polite behaviours she wants 
her son to continue practising.
	
Let us speak
	
	 As you know
	
•	 Intonation is the rise and fall of the pitch of tone while speaking.
	
	 Let us learn about sentence stress.
	
•	 Sentence stress is laying emphasis on certain word(s) in a sentence. 
	
→	The emphasis on particular words helps to convey the meaning 
and importance of the sentence. 
Wit and Humour
85
	
→	Content words like book, run, beautiful, quickly, etc., are mostly 
stressed instead of function words like she, in, is, etc., in a sentence.
	 I	 Speak the given declarative sentence aloud.
	
	 I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon. 
	
•	 Use falling intonation towards end of the sentence as declarative 
sentences usually have falling intonation. 
	
•	 Stress the words ‘Mrs. Cotter’. 
	
	 Remember, stress does not mean to say the word louder than others. It 
means to say a word with more emphasis than others.
	 II	 Speak the following declarative sentences with falling intonation and 
stress the highlighted words.
	
1.	 The room looks cleaner now.	
2.	 You always talk too much.
	
3.	  You leave your clothes all over the house.
	III	 Work in pairs and speak the following sentences 1–5 aloud, as Mary. 
Apply stress and falling intonation. Match each of the sentences to the 
meaning they convey in (i)–(v).
	
	 Sentences
	
1.	 I didn’t hurt anyone today.	
2.	 I didn’t hurt anyone today.
	
3.	 I didn’t hurt anyone today.	
4.	 I didn’t hurt anyone today.
	
5.	 I didn’t hurt anyone today.
	
	 Meaning conveyed
	
(i)	
I might have done other things but did not hurt anyone.
	
(ii)	 I might cause hurt usually, but not anyone on this day.
	
(iii)	 The action of hurting anyone did not occur.
	
(iv)	 I, specifically, did not hurt anyone, possibly implying someone 
else might have.
	
(v)	 I may have spoken a lot many things but not a single person 
was hurt.
Poorvi
	
	 The rising intonation makes it sound like a question. It asks whether I 
was the person who actually saw Mrs. Cotter: Did I see Mrs. Cotter this 
afternoon?
	
Let us write
Rewrite the play ‘Say the Right Thing’ as a short story, focusing on Mary’s 
interactions with her mother and the guests.  
	 •	 Ensure the story captures the main events, character emotions, and 
humorous moments effectively. 
	 •	 Use paragraphs to organise your story and include descriptive language 
to bring the characters and events to life. 	
You may refer to the following hints:
	 •	 Begin with an introduction: describe Mary and Mrs. Shaw, their 
relationship and the setting of the story.
	 •	 Explain Mrs. Shaw’s instructions to Mary before the guests arrive and 
Mary’s confidence in handling the situation.
	 •	 Narrate the events when Mrs. Harding and Mrs. Lee visit, highlighting 
Mary’s remarks and the guests’ reactions.
	 •	 Include key moments of humour and awkwardness to maintain the tone 
of the play.
	 •	 Conclude by commenting on how the visit ended and Mary’s impact on 
the situation.
	 	
Let us explore
	 I	 Work in groups. Enact your favourite part of the play.
	
	 Points to remember:
	 •	 Allot a specific role to each member in the group. 
For example: director, narrator, and characters
Remember
The way we use stress and intonation in a sentence can change the 
meaning of what we wish to say if we are not careful.
86
	IV	 Now, speak the given declarative sentence with rising intonation towards 
the end of sentence and stress the highlighted words. 
	
	 I saw Mrs. Cotter this afternoon.
	 •	 Include the actions and expressions as indicated 
in brackets in the play.
	 II	 Find out how people greet guests who visit their 
homes in different languages. Share it with your 
classmates and the teacher. 
	III	 ‘Vasudhaiva Kuṭumbakaṁ’ (olq/So dqVqEcde) is a 
Sanskrit phrase which means the world is one family. Vasudha (olq/k) 
means Earth; eva (,o) translates to ‘is thus’ and Kuṭumbakaṁ (dqVqEcde) 
means ‘family’. The phrase originates from ancient Indian texts like 
the Maha Upanishad and the Hitopadesha.
	
	 This saying highlights the interconnectedness of all people, 
suggesting that humanity is part of a single global family. It 
encourages unity, cooperation, and treating others with kindness 
and empathy, regardless of differences in nationality, race, or 
religion. The message is often used to promote global peace and 
mutual understanding among diverse cultures and nations. 
‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ was chosen as the theme for the G20 
Summit which captured the essence of global unity, common bonds, 
and shared aspirations for a better future.

all the topics I needed to cover.
Once I finished my lunch, I got up to put my shoes away in my 
room and placed my plate in the kitchen. However, being so 
preoccupied, I ended up doing the opposite! I walked to my room 
with my plate in hand and left it on my desk. Then, I took my 
shoes and placed them in the kitchen!
As I stood there, confused, I realised what I had done. I couldn’t 
help but laugh at myself. I shook my head, recovered my shoes 
from the kitchen and kept the plate in the kitchen.

Mother	 :	Well, that’s when we practise patience. And when it’s 
our turn, what do we say to the shopkeeper?

right?
Mother	 :	Yes! Those are polite words. Why do you think they’re 
important?

important to apologise.
Mother	 :	That’s true. Why do you think it’s important to 
apologise?
Son	
:	Um… so people know I didn’t mean to do it and that I 
care?
Mother	 :	Yes, it shows you’re responsible. And how about when 
we’re in places like the library? What kind of voice 
should we use?
Son	
:	Oh, I know this! We speak softly so we don’t bother 
others.
Mother	 :	Right again! It’s called using an ‘inside voice’.
Son	
:	I know. I also know that we should cover our mouth 
when we yawn, sneeze or cough in a gathering or a 
public place.
Mother	 :	Absolutely! You’re getting really good at remembering 
these things. And when we talk at home or school, what 
should we do when someone else is speaking?
Son	
:	We wait for our turn. It’s not well-mannered to 
interrupt.

young man.

Let us read
I
“Who put that water bag here?” roared my father from the 
front doorstep. “Your burglar alarm,” I hissed to my brother 
Anand, who was getting ready to disappear from the house. 
Ma rushed in to see what the racket was all about and found 
Papa standing there, sopping wet and scowling.
“I want to know who is behind this nonsense,” Papa said 
grimly.
“I think it’s supposed to be a burglar alarm,” Ma said, in a 
soothing voice.
“I don’t care what it’s supposed to be,” Papa said. 
“Where’s that boy? I’m sure he rigged this up.”
Anand had vanished by this time and reappeared only after 
dinner when Papa had cooled down.
Before this story, let me put you in the picture. I am Anita, 
fourteen years old. My brother Anand, one year younger 
than me, caused all that hoo-ha with his burglar alarm. 
And this is not the first time he’s got on Papa’s 
nerves or frightened someone half to death in 
the house. The trouble with him is that he 
thinks he is a scientist. He loves tinkering with 
all sorts of electrical gadgets, tools, dynamos, 
planks of wood, and things like that. And he 
keeps creating ‘inventions’ that never work 
out as they are supposed to. 
Recently there had been a rush of thefts in 
the colony and Anand had got it into his 
head that what was needed was a burglar 
alarm. So, the minute Papa left for the 
office and Ma for the market, he started 
on his latest scheme. As usual I had to 
be involved, though I’d have preferred 
to finish my novel. “If you get a shelling, 
don’t bring me in,” I warned Anand. 
“Nothing will go wrong this time. I’ve 
planned it out carefully. See the blueprint.” 
racket: a loud 
and disturbing 
noise
scowling: having

frowning

rigged up:

tinkering:

dynamos:

sopping: soaking
93
my own doubts about the alarm’s guessing powers, but kept 
them to myself because when Anand is in one of his inventive 
moods, nothing stops him.
“You see,” Anand explained smugly, “A thief tries to open the 
door stealthily. I’ve rigged it up so that the alarm works only 
when the door is opened gently.”
I was sceptical. “Remember, if Papa asks, I’m not involved,” I 
warned. “Now clean up this mess before anyone gets home.”
As you already know, my doubts about the alarm were 
quite justified. Papa, who always opens the door softly, was 
thoroughly soaked and angry as angry could be. Anyway, for 
a week after this, Anand did not dare try out anything new. 
Then we saw this film ‘Back to the Future’. I don’t know if you 
have seen it, but it’s all about a time machine. Well, that was 
stealthily: 
quietly or 
carefully so that 
one is not seen 
or heard
sceptical: 
doubtful
smugly: proudly
clanging: a loud 
ringing sound 
like that of a 
metal being hit
elaborate: 
detailed
Anand loves words like blueprint—it makes 
him feel professional! Anyway, I looked at the 
elaborate drawing of doors, wires, and bells 
and asked, “How does this thing work?”
“It’s quite simple. The moment the door opens, 
this alarm is tripped off and makes a clanging 
sound. Then this water bag here is loosened 
and falls on the thief’s head. By then we call 
the police—simple!”
“But how does the alarm know that a burglar is 
opening the door?”
“I’ve taken care of that,” Anand said loftily. I had 
the end of peace and quiet in 
the house. 
My brother decided that he 
had to make a time machine 
too. Papa locked up his tool 
box and hid the key while Ma 
kept a wary eye on her oven 
and mixer. Because, as I told 
you, when Anand is on one 
of his inventing binges, he 
takes apart all the gadgets in 
the house to collect parts. You 
can’t imagine the noise that 
Dreams and Discoveries

was going on—hammering and sawing and clattering. Anand’s 
room, next to our room, was transformed into a network of 
wires, springs, levers, and bulbs. There was an enormous 
panel which was to be control switchboard. As for Anand, he 
went around looking like a savage. When Ma didn’t notice, the 
fellow didn’t even comb his hair. 
Anand just wouldn’t let anyone into his room. Finally, after a 
fortnight of frantic activity, the time machine was ready. “We 
can try it out tonight,” Anand announced to everyone at home 
at lunch time.
“I don’t know what you’ve been up to in that room, but you’re 
not trying out anything new,” Papa said firmly. 
“But it’s a time machine! I’ve invented it,” Anand protested. 
“When I say NO, I mean NO,” Papa said, glaring. 
“Poor boy,” Ma said noticing Anand’s crestfallen look. 
“At least let’s take a look at it.”
Papa sighed. “All right, but if the house falls, it’s your fault.”
As it turned out, we could not try out the time machine that 
day at all. The next day, Papa and Ma were going to Kharagpur, 
a few hours away from Calcutta (now Kolkata), for a wedding. 
Ma was worried about leaving us alone, but we reassured her. 
“We’re old enough to look after ourselves, Ma,” I said. “And we 
can go next door to Sharma Aunty if we need anything.”
“And it’s only one night,” Anand added. 
“All right. But promise me you won’t do anything with that 
time machine till we come back,” Ma said sternly, looking at 
Anand. He promised half-heartedly, offended at this lack of 
respect for his creation. I breathed a sigh of relief.

They left by the afternoon train and were coming back the 
following evening. Anand fell asleep immediately, but I stayed 
up to finish a novel. At about eleven thirty I thought I heard 
a scratching at the front door. Telling myself it was only my 
imagination, I went back to the book. A little later there was 
a rattle and a click. I was really scared, I can tell you, what 
with a murder story before me and then strange noises in the 
middle of the night! I shook Anand and whispered, “Listen, 
there’s someone at the door.”
“Go and open it then,” he muttered groggily.
“You silly! Someone’s trying to get in,” I said.
Anand sat up. “Who? What?”
“I don’t know,” I said. “What shall we do?”
“Let’s holler for help,” he said. Before we could do anything, 
the door swung open and we found ourselves looking 
at a ruffianly fellow with a green scarf around his neck.
Anand gasped.
“Hey, it’s Boppa!” I whispered. It was indeed the fellow who 
had recently begun sweeping out the compounds in our row of 
houses. So, he was the thief, and no wonder. He knew exactly 
when the occupants were out, leaving the coast clear.
The fellow gave an evil grin. “One squeak out of you and see 
what happens,” he said, brandishing his cudgel and backing 
out of the room. We heard him slide the latch in. 
“What do we do now?” I asked in a low voice.

“Let’s shout anyway,” Anand suggested.
The door opened suddenly again in the middle of our 
discussion.
“No noise from you! Now, where is your father’s room?”
I was about to direct him upstairs when Anand said quickly, 
“The one next to this one.”
“You silly goose!” I said angrily as soon as the man had gone.
“That’s your room. He’ll come back as mad as mad can be.” 
“At least it will give us some time to think of something,” Anand 
said. “He’ll take a while to locate the light switch. Let’s shout.” 
All of a sudden there was a crash followed by a loud scream. 
More strange noises emerged from the next room—a few 
muffled thumps, an eerie whine, and a low, humming sound. 
“My time machine, he’s started it!” Anand gasped. “I wish we 
could get out of this room and see what is happening out there.”
There was another howl, much fainter this time, and a great 
deal of clattering. We shouted for all we were worth. In a few 
minutes, we heard footsteps running up our drive. Thankfully 
we recognised Mrs. Sharma’s voice, along with her husband 
and Dr. Mohan—also a neighbour.
“Anand! Anita! Children, what’s the matter? Where are you?”

“What on earth has been happening here, children?” Sharma

explain. “Where is the fellow now?”
“The last we heard, he was in the time machine,” I explained 
hastily, seeing everyone looking rather puzzled.
We entered the room cautiously and turned on the lights. The 
time machine was still humming softly but otherwise there 
was no other sound from the room. 
“Well, where is he?” Dr. Mohan asked, peering behind the 
door. “Did you imagine this?”
“Oh no,” I protested. “How could both of us have imagined the 
same thing?”
“Maybe he ran out,” Anand suggested.
“I’m sure we’d have seen him. There’s only one way out of this 
house and we came the same way as soon as we heard you,” 
Sharma Uncle sounded very sure.
“Look!” Anand said, pointing to the floor. “He was wearing 
that.” Near the panel of switches was the green scarf.

“Let’s search the house—perhaps he’s still around,” Dr. Mohan 
said, going upstairs.
Boppa was nowhere to be seen. “Well maybe he did run out 
and we missed him,” Mrs. Sharma said at last, “I can’t imagine 
what else could have happened.”
“My time machine! He’s gone through that!” Anand burst out, 
his eyes shining.
“What an imagination this boy has!” Mr. Sharma said, smiling 
indulgently. “Now off to bed, both of you. I’ll spend the night 
here so you needn’t worry about any more intruders now.”

Needless to say, Boppa was never 
seen again. Anand insists that his time 
machine worked and he disappeared 
into the past. The machine itself was 
dismantled because Papa thought it 
wasn’t safe (maybe he also had a niggling 
suspicion that it worked), so we couldn’t 
try it out. 
As for Anand, he is convinced that he 
is a genius and has launched a new 
project—something about a telephone 
to contact creatures in outer space. Tell

Creativity is ‘thinking new things’; innovation is ‘doing new things’ and 
an invention is ‘bringing ideas or objects together in a novel way to create 
something that did not exist before’. All it takes is a simple idea.
Human beings are naturally very curious and creative, and this has led to 
many scientific and technological inventions. You must have heard about 
many famous inventions. Some of them are mentioned below. You may look

them and know who I am.
I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our 
garden, and hope that these blooms of the dawn will 
be carried safely to land in the night.
I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and 
see the little clouds setting the white bulging sails.
I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends 
them down the air to race with my boats!
When night comes I bury my face in my arms and 
dream that my paper boats float on and on under

The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the 
lading is their baskets full of dreams.

Hi everyone,
You won’t believe where I am!
I’m way up north, at the Thajiwas glacier in Kashmir. The 
glaciers are white and blue and we have to wear four layers of 
clothes. Appa and Amma love it here, and they like throwing 
snowballs at each other. But they say there was much more 
snow last year.
I also like the snow, but my hands are shaking from not 
wearing gloves, so I don’t think I can write any more.

Hi everyone,
Did you know that Arunachal Pradesh is far away 
from Himachal Pradesh? Himachal is in the north 
but Arunachal is all the way in the east. I thought 
all the Pradesh states sat next to each other.
We took two trains and drove a long time to get here. 
This morning, we walked through a forest to reach our 
treehouse. The forest here is so thick that if you blink or 
stop to tie your shoelaces, you will get lost.
I love Arunachal the best so far and am beginning to enjoy 
myself. I hope we get to see red pandas.
With love,

Dear class,
We took another train yesterday and reached Himachal 
Pradesh. It is very quiet, and we can see so many 
mountains from our cabin. Colourful birds wake me 
with their chirping when the Sun rises in the east.
chirping: short, 
sharp sound 
made by birds
snoring: 
making a loud 
noise as one 
breathes while 
sleeping
I also think I hear bears 
growling in the west when it 
gets dark. But Amma says that’s 
just Appa snoring. I would love 
to meet a bear and give it a hug.
With love from your best friend,
Shaana

Dear classmates,
It did not take any time at all to travel south west and get 
to the Sundarbans in West Bengal. Today, Amma and Appa 
took me out onto the river in a small boat. Amma tells 
me that places like the Sundarbans are called wetlands.  
I never knew such a place existed, and that it was possible 
for trees called mangroves to grow in seawater! But Amma 
is sad about how much this place floods today.
We also saw crocodiles and a lonely snake while boating.  
I hope they don’t follow us home.
How is everyone? Are you missing me yet?

Hi everyone,
We travelled across the country, all the way from 
east to west, from West Bengal to Gujarat, and it 
took us two-and-a-half days!
I don’t know why my Amma and Appa brought me to 
the middle of the desert. It’s hot, dry, and there’s sand 
everywhere. It’s like a beach without the sea! But I do really 
love the clothes here. They’re so pretty and colourful.
I am sure you’re all busy with your holiday 
homework. Amma gave me a surprise test 
today, and I passed with 88 per cent.

Dear class, 
Today was the best day ever! We drove east from the 
desert to the Narmada river, which flows all the way to 
the centre of India, and it only took us six hours. In the 
afternoon, Amma, Appa, and I went rafting in the river 
and you won’t believe how wild and scary it was. I always 
thought rivers were calm, but up close they’re really fast. 
Appa says that there used to be a lot more water, and 
rafting was much scarier then.
I was fully wet by the time I was done, and Appa was 
so scared that he decided never to go rafting ever again.  
I love the water so much and can’t wait to go back.

here, and beaches too.
There are also a lot of tunnels that the 
train goes through. I used to be afraid of 
tunnels, but I’m not any more. Someday, 
I wish we could all go on a tour of the 
plateaus. Maybe when we’re in Class 11.

Dear friends,
I can’t believe we’re in the same state again! We travelled 
south, and I will be home soon.
We reached Chennai yesterday, and on the way to 
Puducherry, we decided to learn how to surf. I think I’m 
good at it now because I only fell down twice. Amma and 
Appa splashed water on each other and behaved like 
children. It’s a good thing I was there to control them.
The beaches here are not like the ones we have 
on our island. The waves are a lot rougher and 
the water is browner, but I still like it here.

Dear classmates,
I thought Amma and Appa would be tired from all our 
travelling, but we made one last stop at the Olaikaadu 
beach before we reached home. And I’m so happy we 
did.
Amma wanted to teach me how to dive, but they did not 
have diving suits my size, so I spent the day floating and 
looking at the fish while my parents dove below me.
We found all sorts of pebbles on the beach, and I can’t 
wait to give them to you in person tomorrow.

	IV	 Read the following sentences from the text and underline the subject 
and the verb.
	
1.	 Amma and Appa are fast asleep.
	
	 (When the subject of a sentence has two or more nouns or pronouns 
that are connected by ‘and’, we use a plural verb).
	
2.	 It’s hot, dry, and there is sand everywhere.
	
	 (In case the subject is ‘it’, the verb that follows is either ‘is’ or ‘was’ 
depending on the tense of the sentence).
	
3.	 There are so many hills here, and beaches too.
	
	 (When we begin a sentence with ‘there’, the subject comes after the 
verb). 
The subject of a sentence is closely linked to the verb. The verb 
form changes depending on whether the subject is singular or 
plural and if it is in the third person. Choosing the correct verb 
based on the subject is called subject-verb agreement.
	
	 Let us understand subject-verb agreement better.
	
•	A subject and its verb must agree, even if other words or phrases come 
between them.
	
	The formation of paragraphs is important in writing.
	
•	When the subjects are considered individually, we use a singular verb.
	
	Every man and woman has the right to vote.
	
•	Collective nouns such as ‘class’, ‘committee’, ‘audience’, ‘team’ can be 
singular or plural, based on the context of the sentence. If the sentence 
implies the group is acting as one unit, the noun is singular and takes 
a singular verb.
	
	The committee decides on the new policy tomorrow.
	
•	The indefinite pronouns ‘each’, ‘either’, ‘every’, ‘much’, and ‘neither’ 
always require singular verbs.
	
	Each of the children was given a gift.
	
•	Subjects that look plural because they end in ‘s’ but refer to one thing 
are singular. 
	
	Mathematics is an interesting subject.
	
•	Some nouns (like glasses, scissors, pants, and tongs) are plural but take 
a singular verb when the phrase ‘pair of’ is placed before it. Here, 
‘pair’ is the subject.
	
	This pair of scissors is sharp.
130
Poorvi
	
•	When subjects are joined by ‘or’ or ‘nor’, the verb should match the 
subject that is closer to it.
	
3	 Neither the students nor the teacher wants to cancel the trip.
	
3	 Either the manager or the employees are responsible for the 
mistake.
	 V	 Choose the correct option from the words given in the brackets. 
	
1.	 A pair of sunglasses _________ (is/are) essential when travelling to 
sunny destinations.
	
2.	 Either the tour guide or the tourists _________ (has/have) to arrive 
first at the meeting point.
	
3.	 The information on travel expenses _________ (is/are) useful for first-
time travellers.
	
4.	 Neither the flight crew nor the pilot _________ (was/were) aware of 
the delay.
	
5.	 The news about the heavy rains _________ (makes/make) many people 
reconsider their vacation plans.
	
6.	 A pair of binoculars _________ (is/are) useful for spotting wildlife on a 
safari.
	
7.	 The hill stations in India _________ (remains/remain) a popular travel 
destination during winter.
	
8.	 Keeping accounts _________ (is/are) important for spending money 
wisely during travel.
	
9.	 Either the ticket or the bus passes _________ (need/needs) to be used

is located at Patan, Gujarat and is 
also on the World Heritage list by 
UNESCO. Stepwells are a distinctive 
form of water resource and storage 
systems on the Indian subcontinent, 
and were constructed during ancient 
times. They evolved over time from 
what was basically a pit in sandy 
soil towards elaborate multi-storey 
works of art and architecture.

Father	:	Sai dear! What are you working on there with all that paper?

Father	:	Ah, origami! I remember doing that when I was your age. 
You know, Sai, origami has a really interesting history.
Sai	
:	Really? I thought it was just something fun to do with 
paper.
Father	:	It is fun, but it’s also an age-old art form. Origami started 
in Japan over a thousand years ago. Back then, paper 
was really expensive, so it was only used for special 
occasions, like religious ceremonies.
Sai	
:	Wow, I didn’t know that. So, it wasn’t just for doing crafts?
Father	:	It wasn’t until the seventeenth century that people began 
making animals, flowers and other designs just for fun.
Sai	
:	So, people have been making paper cranes for hundreds 
of years?
Father	:	Yes, and the crane is especially important in Japanese 
culture. It’s a symbol of peace and long life. There’s even 
a belief that if you fold a thousand paper cranes, you can 
make a wish, and it will come true.
Sai	
:	A thousand cranes? That’s a lot! But it sounds like a really 
nice tradition.
Father	:	It is. Origami isn’t just about the final shape—it’s about 
the process, the patience and the creativity involved. 
And over the years, it’s spread all over the world, with 
people adding their own styles and techniques.
Sai	
:	I had no idea origami had such a long history. It makes 
folding this crane feel even more special.
Father	:	I’m glad you think so, Sai. Perhaps we can start with 
something simpler next time. How about we make an

	 You will listen to a girl speak about the story of how Agartala got its name 
and the importance of agar. As you listen, choose the correct option for 
the questions given below.
Hi everyone,
We all know that Agartala is the capital of Tripura. But did you 
know how Agartala got its name? It’s made up of two words: 
‘agar’, which is a type of tree, and ‘tala’, meaning underneath. 
So, Agartala means ‘under the agar tree’. These trees are also 
called aloeswood, eaglewood, or gharuwood. It is also referred 
to as ‘wood of the gods’.
Agarwood, the wood from these trees, is really special. It smells 
amazing—like a mix of woody and flowery scents. It is one of 
the rarest and the most expensive woods in the world. People 
have used it for thousands of years in medicines, perfumes and 
rituals. It has been described as early as 1400 BCE in the Vedas. 
The Egyptians are believed to have used agarwood incense as 
part of their rituals more than 3,000 years ago. 
Here’s something even more remarkable—agarwood only forms 
when the tree is hurt or infected with a bug or virus. Instead of 
dying, the tree creates this dark, sticky, sweet-smelling substance 
called agar oil which protects it from further infection.
Agarwood is very important to people in Agartala. It’s used to 
make perfumes, incense, and the hand carvings which Tripura 
is famous for. 
And here’s the best part: the tree was once almost extinct, but 
now, thanks to people taking care of it, you can find it in almost 
every house in northern Tripura. How great is that!

It was almost noon, and the jungle was very still, very silent. 
Heat waves shimmered along the railway embankment where 
it cut a path through the tall evergreen trees. The railway lines 
were two straight black serpents disappearing into the tunnel 
in the hillside.
Suraj stood near the cutting, waiting for the midday train. It 
wasn’t a station, and he wasn’t catching a train. He was waiting 
so that he could watch the steam engine come roaring out of 
the tunnel.
He had cycled out of the town and taken the jungle path until 
he had come to a small village. He had left the cycle there, and 
walked over a low scrub-covered hill and down to the tunnel 
exit.
Now he looked up. He had heard, in the distance, the shrill 
whistle of the engine. He couldn’t see anything, because 
the train was approaching from the other side of the hill;

but presently a sound like distant thunder issued from the 
tunnel, and he knew the train was coming through.
A second or two later, the steam engine shot out of the tunnel, 
snorting and puffing like some green, black, and gold dragon, 
some beautiful monster out of Suraj’s dreams. Showering 
sparks left and right, it roared a challenge to the jungle.
Instinctively, Suraj stepped back a few paces. Waves of hot 
steam struck him in the face. Even the trees seemed to flinch 
from the noise and heat. And then the train had gone, leaving 
only a plume of smoke to drift lazily over the tall shisham 
trees.
The jungle was still again. No one moved.
Suraj turned from his contemplation of the drifting smoke and 
began walking along the embankment towards the tunnel.
The tunnel grew darker as he walked further into it. When 
he had gone about twenty yards, it became pitch dark. Suraj 
had to turn and look back at the opening to reassure himself 
that there was still daylight outside. Ahead of him, the tunnel’s 
other opening was just a small round circle of light.
The tunnel was still full of smoke from the train, but it would 
be several hours before another train came through. Till then, 
the cutting belonged to the jungle again.
Poorvi

Suraj didn’t stop, because there was nothing to do in the tunnel 
and nothing to see. He had simply wanted to walk through, so 
that he would know what the inside of a tunnel was really 
like. The walls were damp and sticky. A bat flew past. A lizard 
scuttled between the lines.
Coming straight from the darkness into the light, Suraj was 
dazzled by the sudden glare and put a hand up to shade his 
eyes. He looked up at the tree-covered hillside and thought he 
saw something moving between the trees.

It was just a flash of orange and gold, 
and a long swishing tail. It was there 
between the trees for a second or 
two, and then it was gone.
About 
fifteen 
metres 
from 
the 
entrance to the tunnel stood the 
watchman’s hut. Marigolds grew in 
front of the hut, and at the back there 
was a small vegetable patch. It was 
the watchman’s duty to inspect the 
tunnel and keep it clear of obstacles. 
Every day, before the train came 
through, he would walk the length of 
the tunnel. If all was well, he would 
return to his hut and take a nap. If something was wrong, 
he would walk back up the line and wave a red flag, and the 
engine driver would slow down. At night, the watchman lit 
an oil lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel. Of 
course, he would not stop the train if there was a porcupine 
on the line. But if there was any danger to the train, he’d go 
back up the line and wave his lamp to the approaching engine. 
If all was well, he’d hang his lamp at the door of his hut and 
go to sleep.
He was just settling down on his cot for an afternoon nap 
when he saw the boy emerge from the tunnel. He waited until 
Suraj was only a metre or so away and then said, “Welcome, 
welcome. I don’t often have visitors. Sit down for a while, and 
tell me why you were inspecting my tunnel.”
“Is it your tunnel?” asked Suraj.
Travel and Adventure
143
“It is,” said the watchman. “It is truly my tunnel, since no one 
else will have anything to do with it. I have only lent it to the 
Government.”
Suraj sat down on the edge of the cot.
“I wanted to see the train come through,” he said. “And then, 
when it had gone, I thought I’d walk through the tunnel.”
“And what did you find in it?”
“Nothing. It was very dark. But when I came out, I thought I 
saw an animal—up on the hill—but I’m not sure, it moved off 
very quickly.”
“It was a leopard you saw,” said the watchman. “My leopard.” 
“Do you own a leopard too?”
“I do.”
“And do you lend it to the Government?” 
“I do not.”
“Is it dangerous?”
“No, it’s a leopard that minds its own business. It comes to this 
range for a few days every month.”
“Have you been here a long time?” asked Suraj. 
“Many years. My name is Sunder Singh.”
“My name’s Suraj.”
“There is one train during the day. And there is one train

during the night. Have you seen the night mail come through 
the tunnel?”
“No. At what time does it come?” 
“About nine o’clock, if it isn’t late. You could come and sit here 
with me, if you like. And after it has gone, instead of going to 
sleep I will take you home.”
“I’ll ask my parents,” said Suraj. “Will it be safe?”
“Of course. It is safer in the jungle than in the town. Nothing 
happens to me out here. But last month, when I went into 
town, I was almost run over by a bus.”
Sunder Singh yawned and stretched himself out on the cot. 
“And now I am going to take a nap, my friend. It is too hot to 
be up and about in the afternoon.”
“Everyone goes to sleep in the afternoon,” complained Suraj. 
“My father lies down as soon as he’s had his lunch.”
“Well, the animals also rest in the heat of the day. It is only the 
tribe of boys who cannot, or will not, rest.”
Sunder Singh placed a large banana leaf over his face to 
keep away the flies, and was soon snoring gently. Suraj stood 
up, looking up and down the railway tracks. Then he began 
walking back to the village.

The following evening, towards dusk, as the flying foxes 
swooped silently out of the trees, Suraj made his way to the 
watchman’s hut.
It had been a long hot day, but now the earth was cooling, and 
a light breeze was moving through the trees. It carried with it 
the scent of mango blossoms, the promise of rain.
Sunder Singh was waiting for Suraj. He had watered his small 
garden, and the flowers looked cool and fresh. A kettle was 
boiling on a small oil stove.
“I am making tea,” he said. “There is nothing like a glass of hot 
tea while waiting for a train.”
They drank their tea, listening to the sharp notes of the 
tailorbird and the noisy chatter of the seven sisters.

As the brief twilight faded, most of the birds fell silent. Sunder 
Singh lit his oil lamp and said it was time for him to inspect the 
tunnel. He moved off towards the tunnel, while Suraj sat on 
the cot, sipping his tea. In the dark, the trees seemed to move 
closer to him. And the nightlife of the forest was conveyed on 
the breeze—the sharp call of a barking deer, the cry of a fox, 
the quaint tonk-tonk of a nightjar. There were some sounds 
that Suraj didn’t recognise—sounds that came from the trees, 
creakings and whisperings, as though the trees were coming to 
life, stretching their limbs in the dark, shifting a little, flexing 
their fingers.
Sunder Singh stood inside the tunnel, trimming his lamp. 
The night sounds were familiar to him and he did not give 
them much thought; but something else—a padded footfall, a 
rustle of dry leaves—made him stand still for a few seconds, 
peering into the darkness. Then, humming softly to himself, he 
returned to where Suraj was waiting. Ten minutes remained 
for the night mail to arrive.
As Sunder Singh sat down on the cot beside Suraj, a new sound 
reached both of them quite distinctly—a rhythmic sawing 
sound, as if someone cutting through the branch of a tree.
“What’s that?” whispered Suraj.
“It’s the leopard,” said Sunder Singh. “I think it’s in the tunnel.”
“The train will soon be here,” said Suraj.
“Yes, my friend. And if we don’t drive the leopard out of the 
tunnel, it will be run over and killed. I can’t let that happen.”
“But won’t it attack us if we try to drive it out?” asked Suraj, 
beginning to share the watchman’s concern.
“Not this leopard. It knows me well. We have seen each other 
many times. It has a weakness for goats and stray dogs, but it 
will not harm us. Even so, I’ll take my axe with me. You stay 
here, Suraj.”
“No, I’m coming with you. It will be better than sitting here 
alone in the dark!” 
“All right, but stay close behind me. And remember, there is 
nothing to fear.”

Raising his lamp, Sunder Singh advanced into the tunnel, 
shouting at the top of his voice to try and scare away the 
animal. Suraj followed close behind, but he found he was 
unable to do any shouting. His throat was quite dry.
lithe: thin, 
graceful
sinewy: lean 
and muscular

They had gone about twenty paces into the tunnel when the 
light from the lamp fell upon the leopard. It was crouching 
between the tracks, only five metres away from them. It was 
not a very big leopard, but it looked lithe and sinewy. Baring 
its teeth and snarling, it went down on its belly, tail twitching.
Suraj and Sunder Singh both shouted together. Their voices 
rang through the tunnel. And the leopard, uncertain as to how 
many terrifying humans were there in the tunnel with him, 
turned swiftly and disappeared into the darkness.
To make sure that it had gone, Sunder Singh and Suraj walked 
the length of the tunnel. When they returned to the entrance, 
the rails were beginning to hum. They knew the train was 
coming.
Suraj put his hand to one of the rails and felt its tremor. He 
heard the distant rumble of the train. And then the engine 
came round the bend, hissing at them, scattering sparks into 
the darkness, defying the jungle as it roared through the steep 
defying:

sides of the cutting. It charged straight at the tunnel, and into it, 
thundering past Suraj like the beautiful dragon of his dreams.
And when it had gone, the silence returned and the forest 
flickering:  
burning 
unsteadily
fringe: edge
shrill: sharp 
sound
seemed to breathe, to live again. Only the 
rails still trembled with the passing of 
the train.
They trembled again to the passing of the 
same train, almost a week later, when 
Suraj and his father were both travelling 
in it.
Suraj’s father was scribbling in a 
notebook, doing his accounts. Suraj sat 
at an open window staring out at the 
darkness. His father was going to Delhi 
on a business trip and had decided 
to take the boy along. (“I don’t know 
where he gets to, most of the time,” he’d 
complained. “I think it’s time he learnt 
something about my business.”)
The night mail rushed through the forest with its hundreds of 
passengers. The carriage wheels beat out a steady rhythm on 
the rails. Tiny flickering lights came and went, as they passed 
small villages on the fringe of the jungle.
Suraj heard the rumble as the train passed over a small bridge. 
It was too dark to see the hut near the cutting, but he knew 
they must be approaching the tunnel. He strained his eyes 
looking out into the night; and then, just as the engine let out 
a shrill whistle, Suraj saw the lamp.
He couldn’t see Sunder Singh, but he saw the lamp, and he 
knew that his friend was out there.
The train went into the tunnel and out again; it left the jungle 
behind and thundered across the endless plains.
Suraj stared out at the darkness, thinking of the lonely cutting 
in the forest and the watchman with the lamp, who would 
always remain a firefly for those travelling thousands as he lit 
up the darkness for steam engines and leopards.

III 	 Read what the watchman Sunder Singh did regularly at the tunnel as 
part of his duty. Notice the use of ‘would’.
	
	 Every day, before the train came through, he would walk the length of 
the tunnel. If all was well, he would return to his hut and take a nap. If 
something was wrong, he would walk back up the line and wave a red flag 
and the engine driver would slow down. At night, the watchman lit an oil 
lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel. 
	
1.	 Why is the word ‘would’ used here?
	
(i)	 to make a polite request
	
(ii)	 to express a desire
	
(iii)	 to talk about a habit in the past 
	
	 In these sentences, the word ‘would’ is used to speak about a past habit.
‘Would’ is used in these sentences to describe repeated activities for 
a period of time in the past. We call them ‘habitual or routine actions 
in the past’.
	
	 Would and used to both describe something that happened regularly in 
the past. However, ‘used to’ indicates a past action that doesn’t happen 
any longer.
	
•	I used to paint when I was in Grade 4.
	
•	Riya used to eat a lot of junk food, but she stopped last year.

	IV	 We use punctuation marks to make our writing clear. You already know 
how to use full stops and commas. Let us look at three more punctuation 
marks—brackets, semicolon, and colon.
	
	 Colon (:) is used to introduce a list or an explanation. 
	
•	You need the following ingredients to make Ela Ada: ghee, coconut, 
jaggery, and rice flour.
	
•	He has one goal: to win the championship.
	
	 Semicolon (;) is used to connect two clauses which are closely related 
without a conjunction. 
	
•	She loves reading; he prefers watching movies.
	
•	Suraj followed close behind; but he found he was unable to do any 
shouting.
	
	 Now, use semicolons and colons to punctuate the following paragraph.

Let us read
The railroad track is miles away, 
    And the day is loud with voices speaking, 
Yet there isn’t a train goes by all day 
    But I hear its whistle shrieking.
All night there isn’t a train goes by, 
    Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming, 
But I see its cinders red on the sky, 
    And hear its engine steaming.
My heart is warm with the friends I make, 
    And better friends I’ll not be knowing; 
Yet there isn’t a train I wouldn’t take, 
    No matter where it’s going.

	 II	 Now, listen to the announcement again and rectify the sentences. 
	
Let us speak 
When speaking in English, small differences in pronunciation can change the 
overall meaning of the words. One such difference is in the pronunciation of 
the consonant ‘c’. 
For example: cat (uses /k/ sound for ‘c’) and city (uses the /s/ sound for ‘c’)
The poem uses the word ‘cinders’, which is pronounced with a /s/ sound.
The letter ‘c’ has two sounds. It can be pronounced as a /k/ or /s/ sound. 
But which is right depends on the next letters of the words. 
	
•	Letter ‘c’ produces /s/ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘e’, ‘i’, 
or ‘y’. For example, city (‘c’ is followed by ‘i’). This /s/ sound is 
known as the soft ‘c’ sound.
	
•	Letter ‘c’ produces /k/ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘a’, ‘o’, 
or ‘u’ or a consonant at the end of the word. For example, cat (‘c’ 
is followed by ‘a’). This /k/ sound is known as the hard ‘c’ sound.
That is why ‘cinders’ is pronounced with a /s/ sound. The letter ‘c’ is followed 
by ‘i’!
Now, work in pairs. Pronounce the given words aloud. Keep the rules of the 
soft and hard ‘c’ pronunciation in mind.

This is a story that narrates the triumph of will, 
courage, determination, and dedication. Arunima 
Sinha’s journey from a devastating accident to 
scaling the highest peak in the world stands as a 
beacon of hope and resilience. In 2011, at the age 
of 24, Arunima Sinha, a national-level volleyball 
player, faced a life-altering event. It challenged 
her in ways she could never have imagined. As 
she lay in the hospital bed with one leg amputated, 
Arunima made a vow that many would deem 
impossible: not only to walk again with a 
prosthetic leg but to scale Mount Everest. In 2013, 
she did just that, becoming the first Indian female 
amputee to achieve this feat. Hence, in 2015, she 
was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest 
civilian award in India. She was also awarded the 
Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award and

National Award for Best Female Mountaineer.
Arunima hails from Ambedkar Nagar, a small district in Uttar 
Pradesh. Her father was an army engineer, and her mother 
worked as a health supervisor. Sports were a significant part 
of Arunima’s life, with her family having a natural inclination 
towards athletics. After completing her law degree following 
her post-graduation, Arunima decided to pursue a job in the 
paramilitary forces, which would allow her to continue her 
passion for sports while having a regular income.
On the fateful night of 11 April 2011, she met with a train 
accident. The hours that followed were harrowing. She never 
imagined she would survive that night, but survive she did, 
miraculously, displaying an extraordinary will to live. Arunima 
received a prosthetic leg and underwent physiotherapy. It was 
during this period that she made a profound decision. Inspired 
by an article about Mount Everest, she resolved to conquer 
the highest peak in the world. 
To pursue her ambition, Arunima Sinha completed a 
basic mountaineering course at the Nehru Institute of 
Mountaineering in Uttarkashi, followed by eighteen months 
of rigorous training. Arunima approached Bachendri Pal, the 
Poorvi
first Indian woman to summit Everest, to guide her in the 
endeavour. Bachendri Pal instilled confidence in Arunima 
and said, “My child, you decided to climb Mount Everest in 
these situations with a prosthetic leg—you have conquered 
the Everest within you; the world will realise it later.”
On 21 May 2013, after 52 exhausting days, Arunima Sinha 
reached the summit of Mount Everest. Standing at the top 
of the world, she felt a surge of emotions—pride, relief, and 
an overwhelming sense of achievement. She displayed the 
Indian flag at the summit and left behind a photograph of her 
idol, Swami Vivekananda, whose teachings had inspired her 
throughout her journey.
Arunima’s feat did not end with Everest. By July 2016, she 
had summited seven peaks in Europe, Africa, Australia, 
South America, North America, and 
of course, Mount Everest in Asia. 
In January 2019, she climbed the 
seventh peak on Antarctica and 
became world’s first female amputee 
to climb Mount Vinson. Her goal to 
complete the Seven Summits was 
achieved.
Throughout her journey, Arunima 
has faced numerous challenges and 
setbacks. Yet, her story is not just about 
physical endurance but 
also about mental 
endeavour: an 
attempt to do 
something
surge: a sudden 
and great 
increase

Arunima’s autobiography, Born Again on the Mountain: A Story 
of Losing Everything and Finding It Back records her incredible 
journey to the top of the world. It is a story of triumph over 
adversity, a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to rise 
above the most challenging circumstances. 
She was conferred with the honorary doctorate by the 
University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK. In her words, “Failure 
is not when we fall short of achieving our goals. It is when 
we don’t have goals worthy enough. Never forget your goal, 
respect it, work hard, and you will be the winner.” Dr. Arunima 
Sinha has not only conquered mountains but has also won 
people’s hearts the world over, inspiring them to reach their 
own summits.

school trip to the National Science Centre. As you listen, circle the words 
that are not correct. 
Good morning students!
I have some very exciting news to share with you all. The much-
awaited educational trip to the National Science Centre will be 
held on 16 September, that is in two weeks! As you know this 
would be a fantastic opportunity to explore and learn more 
about the world around us. 
We will be starting from school at 8.00 in the morning and return 
by 5.30 in the evening. All of you must be in proper school uniform. 
Don’t forget to carry your identity cards. Light refreshments will 
be provided at the museum. But do carry a water bottle and a 
packed lunch. You are not permitted to wear any jewellery or 
carry mobile phones. You may carry a notebook and a pen to 
make notes. Interested students must bring a permission slip 
signed by your parent and submit them to their class teachers 
by 10 September. It is going to be a fun trip so don’t miss out. If 
you have any more questions, please contact Mr. Mukherjee, the 
excursion in-charge.

There are three extra statements that you do not need.
Speaker (i): 	 As a parent, I fear the risks involved, especially 
with activities like rock climbing or paragliding.

Travel and Adventure
I’m quite worried about the safety risks of adventure 
sports. It’s important to consider these risks before 
letting children participate.
Speaker (ii): 	 Adventure sports are thrilling! All my friends 
agree; it is amazing. It’s not just about fun; it’s about 
pushing your limits and experiencing something 
new. I think it’s worth trying, of course, with a 
trainer. 
Speaker (iii):	As organisers of adventure camps, we take safety 
very seriously. Our team ensures all equipment is 
regularly checked and maintained. Participants are 
given thorough training and are always supervised 
by professionals. We focus on minimising risks 
while still providing an exciting experience.
Speaker (iv): At our school, we organise adventure camps with 
activities like trekking and zip-lining. However, we 
stick to basic sports that are safe and manageable 
for students. We always prioritise safety, ensuring 
that all necessary precautions and measures are in 
place. Being careful is what we promote.
Speaker (v): In my opinion, sports should be about fitness and 
enjoyment, like track and field or swimming. Why 
risk your life for a fleeting moment of thrill just for 
a feeling of adventure? Traditional sports are safer 
and just as fulfilling!

A big bright tear splashed down her nose. And another. 
A kingfisher swept down, its wings an arrow of blue in the 
sunlight. And a green lizard slithered down to the river’s edge 
to bask in the sun.
“Dear, dear!” said a sleepy, murmuring voice, “What’s the 
matter?”
Jahnavi was startled, because she was sure she had been quite 
alone. It couldn’t have been the lizard. And the kingfisher was 
up in the thicket of bamboo eating the fish it had caught. It 
couldn’t be the parrots, because parrots shrieked and this was 
such a sleepy voice. She looked around her. There wasn’t a 
soul in sight. She was rather scared and wanted to run away.
“You shouldn’t cry, you know,” the voice went on. “And you 
really shouldn’t be scared, when you have been coming here 
to see me every day, well, almost every day.”

She was puzzled. It was such a voice, like 
the river. It couldn’t be the river!
“Well, tell me all about it,” said the River, 
for it was the River. “I’ve got to hurry to reach 
the sea, you know.”
“They won’t let me go to school,” said Jahnavi. 
“I asked my mother, ‘Why can’t I go to school 
like Ettan and Meena?’ And Mother had 
replied, ‘You are too small, baby. Maybe 
later.’ ” But when she was five, little 
Ramu was born and Mother still said, 
“Maybe next year. Jahnavi, mind your 
little brother while I go to the fields.” 
Now, she was nearly ten and minding 
Little Appu, who was the smallest. “They 
don’t want me. They only...”—she stopped with a sob...
“I am scared to go to school. And I’m so old now, they’ll never 
let me go. But I want to go. I want to learn to read like Ettan 
and Meena.” Jahnavi called her brother ‘Ettan’.  Ettan means 
‘Elder brother’, but his real name was Gopi. “I want to know 
why spiders are yellow in yellow flowers, why bamboo 
trees rustle, why the moon always comes from 
behind the hills, never the other way, why 
the baby fish in the field water become 
frogs, why...”
“Stop!” said the River. “You make me 
breathless. So many whys! I can tell 
you where the moon goes,” the River 
said conspiratorially. “It goes down 
towards the sea. I’ve seen; it always 
takes the same way—over the 
mountains and down to the sea, 
like me!”

“Even little Ramu goes to school,” said Jahnavi, “pity, the school 
isn’t by the sea,” said the River. “Then I could take you along, 
you know. But, I suppose I couldn’t really. You’d get your feet 
wet. And that would never do! I’m afraid there’s only one thing 
you can do.”
“Can I do something?” asked Jahnavi. “Well, it’s up to you,” 
said the River. “Seems to me little girls can do as much as little 
boys—they swim as fast as little boys. You just slip along one 
morning and sit there in the school and listen to what’s going 
on, and maybe the teacher will let you stay.”
“I couldn’t,” gasped Jahnavi. “I couldn’t! They’d scare me! 
They’d chase me out.”
The River laughed. “You? Scared?” the River said, “when you’re 
not afraid of the green lizard, or of the snake in the bamboo 
clump, (Jahnavi startled) or the big trains rattling past that 
bridge.” “Trains are noisy; I prefer ships,” said the River.
Jahnavi never knew the snake lived in the bamboo clump.
“What are ships?” she asked.
“Big boats,” said the River, “so big that they can take hundreds 
of people, and they sail along the sea with lights that shine all 
night.”
Jahnavi held her breath. “Will they come here?” she asked. 
“I’m afraid not,” said the River. “Too large, you know. Chandu’s 
catamaran is good enough for me. Chandu can take you to see 
a ship, someday.”
“They’d never let me!” wailed Jahnavi. 
“Try going to school first,” said the River. “Remember—it’s up 
to you!”

Jahnavi gathered courage. The next day she reached the school, 
panting and out of breath and stood by the door listening while 
the teacher read out the lesson. It was a story about a prince 
called Asˊ hoka, who became a great king. Little Appu had fallen 
asleep on her shoulder. She crept nearer and nearer till she was 
in the back row, squatting with the others on the earthen floor. 
Little Appu made no noise and she listened.
“Where did you spring from, little girl?” asked the teacher. “And 
what is your name? You’re new in my class.” 
“She’s Gopi’s sister, Gopi is in the next class,” said one of the boys. 
“It’s Jahnavi,” said another. “So, you’re Gopi’s little sister? Nice 
lad, Gopi.”
“If you really, really want to come to my school, Jahnavi,” the 
teacher had said, “we’ll talk to your father about it. Don’t you 
worry. We’ll find a way.”
Jahnavi saw the teacher walking up the steps to their gate the 
next evening when she was lighting the lamp. She could see her 
father scratching his cheek the way he did when he was worried 
and the teacher was nodding and saying something she couldn’t 
make out. And Mother said, “Little Jahnavi, I shall miss you when 
you go to school. Girls should learn as much as they want. When I 
was your age, I wanted to go to school, but your grandmother said 
‘No’, but now, I am glad the teacher came to talk to your father.”

And Jahnavi said, “Mother, when I grow up, I’ll be 
a teacher and I’ll go from house to house in our 
village and ask all the little girls to come to my 
school. And I’ll teach them all that I’m going to 
learn.”
And she went down the path between the fields 
the next morning before school began, to meet 
the River. “I did it!” she told the River. “I was 
scared, but I did it! And they’re letting me go. I’m 
going to learn to write my name and do sums and 
find out why our little fishes in the rice fields turn 
into frogs.” She heard the river’s sleepy chuckle, 
“Come again, little girl, and I’ll tell you all about 
the ships that sail the sea.”

Let us read
King Bruce of Scotland flung himself down 
In a lonely mood to think; 
‘Tis true he was monarch, and wore a crown, 
But his heart was beginning to sink.
For he had been trying to do a great deed, 
To make his people glad; 
He had tried and tried, but couldn’t succeed 
And so he became quite sad.
He flung himself down in low despair, 
As grieved as man could be; 
And after a while he pondered there, 
“I’ll give it all up,” said he.
Now just at that moment a spider dropped, 
With its silken, filmy clue; 
And the King, in the midst of his thinking, stopped 
To see what the spider would do.
‘Twas a long way up to the ceiling dome, 
And it hung by a rope so fine; 
That how it would get to its cobweb home, 
King Bruce could not divine.

It soon began to cling and crawl 
Straight up with strong endeavour; 
But down it came with a slippery sprawl, 
As near to the ground as ever.
Up, up it ran, not a second to stay, 
To utter the least complaint; 
Till it fell still lower, and there it lay, 
A little dizzy and faint.
Its head grew steady — again it went, 
And travelled a half-yard higher; 
‘Twas a delicate thread it had to tread, 
And a road where its feet would tire.
Again it fell and swung below, 
But again it quickly mounted; 
Till up and down, now fast, now slow, 
Nine brave attempts were counted.
“Sure,” cried the King, “that foolish thing 
Will strive no more to climb; 
When it toils so hard to reach and cling, 
And tumbles every time.”
But up the insect went once more, 
Ah me! ‘tis an anxious minute; 
He’s only a foot from his cobweb door, 
Oh say, will he lose or win it?
Steadily, steadily, inch by inch, 
Higher and higher he got; 
And a bold little run at the very last pinch 
Put him into his native cot.
“Bravo, bravo!” the King cried out, 
“All honour to those who try; 
The spider up there, defied despair; 
He conquered, and why shouldn’t I?”
And Bruce of Scotland braced his mind, 
And gossips tell the tale, 
That he tried once more as he tried before, 
And that time did not fail.

Let us read 
I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me 
through mere touch. I feel the delicate symmetry of a 
leaf. I pass my hands lovingly about 
the smooth skin of a silver birch, or 
the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. In 
spring, I touch the branches of trees 
hopefully in search of a bud, the first 
sign of awakening Nature after her 
winter’s sleep. Occasionally, I am very 
fortunate; I place my hand gently on a 
small tree and feel the happy quiver of 
a bird in full song. 
At times, my heart cries out with 
longing to see all these things. If I can 
get so much pleasure from mere touch, 
how much more beauty must be revealed by sight. And 
I have imagined what I should most like to see if I were 
given the use of my eyes, say, for just three days. 
I should divide the period into three parts. On the first 
day, I should want to see the people whose kindness and 
companionship have made my life worth living. I do not 
know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through 
that ‘window of the soul’, the eye. 
I can only ‘see’ through my fingertips the outline of a face. 
I can detect laughter, sorrow and other obvious emotions. 
I know my friends from the feel of their faces.

At midnight, permanent night would close in on me again. 
Naturally in those three short days I should not have seen all 
I wanted to see. Only when darkness had again descended 
upon me should I realise how much I had left unseen.
I who am blind can give one hint to those who can see: use 
your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind. And 
the same method can be applied to your other senses. Hear 
the music of voice, the song of a bird, the mighty strains of an 
orchestra, as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch 
each object as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell 
the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if 
tomorrow you could never smell and taste again. Make the 
most of every sense; glory in all the facets of pleasure and 
beauty, which the world reveals to you through the several 
means of contact, which Nature provides. But of all the senses, 
I am sure that sight must be the most delightful.

a person. Therefore, she refers to the eye as ‘window of the soul’. 
How is the narrator able to understand the feelings of a person? 
 
Let us think and reflect
	 I	 Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow.
	
1.	 I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf. I pass my hands lovingly about 
the smooth skin of a silver birch, or the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. 
In spring, I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud, the 
first sign of awakening Nature after her winter’s sleep. Occasionally, I 
am very fortunate; I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the 
happy quiver of a bird in full song.

by which night is transformed into day. I should behold with awe 
the magnificent panorama of light with which the sun awakens the 
sleeping earth. This day I should devote to a hasty glimpse of the world, 
past and present. I should want to see the pageant of man’s progress, 
and so I should go to the museums.

2.	 They might arrive late due to traffic. 
Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express necessity, possibility, 
permission, or ability. They are used before the main verb to give 
additional information about the function of the main verb. Common 
modal verbs include can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, 
must, and ought to.
	
Let us learn
	 I	 Sensory words are descriptive—they describe how we experience the 
world: how we see, hear, smell, taste or feel something.
	
	 Complete the following table with sensory words from the text in Column

•	 The next day I should arise with the dawn…
	
•	 I should behold with awe…
	
	 The words you have underlined are a combination of two verbs. In 
each of these sentences, ‘should’ is the modal verb (suggestion), and the

	 I	 Do you know how persons with 
visual challenges are able to read 
and write? They read through 
touch with the help of Braille, a 
code of raised dots that represents 
the letters of the alphabet. This 
tactile code was developed over 
a period of nine years by Louis 
Braille, who became blind at a very 
young age due to an accident.

Let us listen (refer to page 12)
	 I	 Read the words given in the box below. You will listen to five people 
speak about school life. As you listen, circle the words that are used by 
the speakers. There are two words you do not need. 
Speaker (i):		 (Father) Should girls attend school? Yes, they 
should. I do my best to ensure that both my son and 
daughter get equal opportunities. I look forward 
to their successful careers and rewarding lives. I 
feel education gives freedom to make choices in 
life. Whether my daughter wants to work in an 
organisation or be a homemaker, it should be her 
choice and the same applies to my son. 
Speaker (ii):	 (Grandmother) I went to school but many girls at 
that time could not attend school because some 
elders in the village felt that girls should help in 
the house and take care of their little brothers and 
sisters. I am happy that the situation has changed 
today.
Speaker (iii):	(Teacher) 
The 
school 
prepares 
students 
for 
meaningful and useful participation in the world 
of work by learning hands-on abilities and skills, 
developing equal respect for head-hands-heart, 
valuing the dignity of labour, and understanding 
vocational choices for the future. 
Speaker (iv):	(Student) I like to go to school. I feel that by coming 
to school and reading the books, I learn about things 
from all over the world. I also have friends with 
whom I can share my feelings.

Speaker (v)	:	 (Principal) Everyone should attend school. You 
must’ve noticed that the girls are doing very well. 
However, as the Head of an institution, I know that 
all students can work hard. My message to students 
is that they should attend school regularly and take 
part in every school activity without bothering 
whether it is for girls or boys. The idea is to focus on 
learning.

Try Again
	
Let us listen (refer to page 24)
	 1.	 You will listen to a story about an ant. Read the questions given below 
and before you listen, guess the answers to these questions. 
	
	 Hello everyone,
	
	 I’m sure you have enjoyed learning about King Bruce and the spider. Let 
me share another story with you. 
In a thick green forest, there lived a little ant. She was known for 
her determination and never-give-up attitude. One sunny day, 
the ant found a delicious piece of roti that was too big for her to 
carry alone.
“This crumb is huge, but I must get it back to the anthill. My 
family will be so happy!” she thought to herself.
She tried to lift the crumb with all her might, but it was too heavy. 
She tried pushing it, pulling it and even rolling it, but nothing 
seemed to work. Exhausted and saddened, she sat down and 
began to cry.
As the ant sat there, feeling beaten, she noticed a small bird 
nearby. The bird was trying to build a nest. It picked up twigs 
and leaves, but every time it tried to place them, the wind would 
blow them away. However, the bird did not give up. It kept trying, 
over and over again, until finally, it managed to build a strong 
nest.
Poorvi
40
“If that bird can keep trying and succeed, then I shouldn’t give 
up either,” she thought, feeling inspired.
Determined once more, the ant gathered all her strength and 
decided to try again. She called her fellow ants for help. Together, 
they formed a chain and lifted the crumb with their combined 
strength. Slowly but surely, they carried the crumb back to the 
anthill.
“We did it! Thank you, everyone! We showed that with teamwork 
and never giving up, we can achieve anything!” the ant shouted, 
excited and grateful.
She and her friends celebrated their success. 
We too should learn this lesson from the ant’s experience—never 
give up, no matter how difficult the situation may seem. 
Hope you all liked the story. 
Thank you!

answers are correct. Rectify wherever needed.

her books doesn’t look like ours. It’s different. She told 
us that it’s called Braille.
Mother	:	It’s great to know that your school has facilities to 
address the needs of the visually impaired. Thanks to 
the Digital India Initiative, which is paving the way for 
inclusion of the visually impaired.
Learning Together

Anuj	
:	Oh, Digital India! That’s about being computer literate, 
isn’t it? 
Mother	:	Well, Digital India is about more than just internet 
access. It aims to include everyone, including people 
with disabilities, by providing digital infrastructure 
and services. For the visually impaired, it means access 
to assistive technologies like screen readers, voice-over-
enabled smartphones and apps that can make daily 
activities easier.
Anuj	
:	Ohh... interesting. What is a screen reader, Ma?
Mother	:	I knew you’d ask about it! Well, a screen reader is a 
software application that helps people who are visually 
impaired use computers and smartphones. It reads out 
the text displayed on the screen and provides audio 
feedback.
Anuj	
:	That’s amazing! So, Tara can use a computer just like 
we do?
Mother	:	Yes, she can. 
Anuj	
:	So, it makes a big difference in their daily lives.
Mother	:	It certainly does. It ensures that people who are visually 
impaired can use digital services independently, without 
help from others. This can improve their quality of life. 
It also opens up more job opportunities in fields like IT, 
banking, and more, where they can work just efficiently 
like anybody else.
Anuj	
:	Wow! So that means people who are visually impaired 
can work and do things on their own? I’m so proud of 
my school.
Mother	:	Yes, and this way, we can ensure that the benefits of 
Digital India reach everyone, helping them to participate 
fully in all areas of life.
	
	 Remember, inclusion is not just about having the right tools, but also 
about having the right mindset.

Textbook of English for Grade 7
FOREWORD
The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the 
country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments 
in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time 
preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and 
challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been 
well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 
(NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the 
students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human 
existence, the pañchakośhas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages 
have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle 
Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and 
the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. 
The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the 
skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours 
to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and 
to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A 
diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at 
least two languages native to India—Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, 
Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education 
promotes their holistic development. 
Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential 
conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different 
curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating 
between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious 
balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and 
inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher 
preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and 
across curricular areas. 
The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is 
committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various 
Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, 
comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as 
their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. 
Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 7 is one of these. Its content 
comprises stories, poems, and narratives that ensure a reflection of their 
social, cultural, and geographical landscapes wherein students are sure to 
find traces of their lived experiences. Poorvi also weaves into its contents 
iv
iv
snippets from the vast treasure-trove of Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s 
artistic and cultural heritage, and embeds values alongside ecological 
sensitivity, gender equality, digital skills, etc. For all practical purposes, it 
has, to my mind, succeeded in its Curricular Goals: first, to foster natural 
curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, 
develop among them the core competencies in listening, speaking, reading, 
and writing by intelligently designing various activities around them, 
thereby seamlessly integrating vocabulary and grammar within meaningful 
contexts. 
However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also 
be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries 
play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of 
parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging 
students to do so. 
With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in 
the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations 
of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback 
from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

Poorvi, a textbook of English for Grade 7, is developed in alignment with 
the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National 
Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language 
education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression and 
appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are very closely linked with 
language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language 
development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and 
practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others 
to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. 
The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well 
beyond the Preparatory Stage. 
Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the 
guiding principles while developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) 
cover a range of competencies. The NCF-SE 2023 has stated the following 
Curricular Goals:
CG-1: 	 Develops independent reading, comprehension, and summarising 
skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, 
articles, and news reports).
CG-2: 	 Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings, and experiences 
of social events.
CG-3: 	 Develops the capacity for effective communication using language 
skills for questioning, describing, analysing, and responding.
CG-4: 	 Explores different literary devices and forms of literature.
CG-5: 	 Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and 
sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression. 
CG-6:	 Develops an appreciation of the distinctive features of the language, 
including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other 
wordplays and games unique to the language (pp. 245–246).
The Curricular Goals have been covered through a variety of themes 
and an array of activities. There are five thematic units that comprise 
stories, poems, conversation, narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes 
such as learning together, wit and humour, dreams and discoveries, 
travel and adventure and homage to bravehearts have been included. 
Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage,

unit has three literary pieces―story, poem, conversation or non-fiction. 
ABOUT THE BOOK
vi
vi
There are in-text questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the 
text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are 
designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, etc.
Unit 1 — ‘Learning Together’ encourages students to explore the 
interconnectedness of nature and human life. The story, ‘The Day the River 
Spoke’, emphasises the importance of respecting and listening to nature. 
The river encourages Jahnavi to overcome her fears and societal barriers 
by boldly pursuing her desire for education, assuring that her courage can 
make a difference. The poem, ‘Try Again’ inspires resilience and the power 
of perseverance, encouraging students to view challenges as stepping stones 
to success. The poem leaves a powerful impact on the readers, inspiring 
them to achieve their best goal in life. ‘Three Days to See’ presents a touching 
narrative of a girl who cannot see and that invites learners to appreciate 
their senses and value the beauty of the world around them.
Unit 2 — ‘Wit and Humour’ engages students with a light-hearted story, 
poem, and play. These delightful works showcase the charm of intelligence, 
humour and laughter. The amusing tale of ‘Animals, Birds, and Dr. Dolittle’ 
will help students explore the idea of a doctor who learns animal language. 
He not only communicates with animals but also treats their ailments with 
empathy. The story is a fable that entertains and also educates about animal 
care. The poem, ‘A Funny Man’ celebrates humour which can be unfamiliar 
that can spark curiosity and amusement. ‘Say the Right Thing’ highlights the 
comic consequences of miscommunication. The play focuses on the fact that 
it is important to say the right thing at the right time. We must listen carefully 
to what others are saying and we must think before we speak.
Unit 3 — ‘Dreams and Discoveries’ captures the essence of wonder and 
imagination of children. It also sparks curiosity and creativity, encouraging 
students to explore how dreams and discoveries shape the world. ‘My 
Brother’s Great Invention’ is a humorous story about a boy who likes to 
discover new things around him. This leads to an unexpected encounter 
with a thief. The story highlights determination, creativity, and sibling bonds, 
teaching students the value of trial and error in discovery. The poem ‘Paper 
Boats’ uses the imagery of paper boats to symbolise dreams and aspirations. 
Students will reflect on the joy of simple pleasures and the universal desire 
to connect with the unknown. ‘North, South, East, West’ will help students 
appreciate the diversity that exists in our country. The narrative presents 
postcards from a girl exploring India’s diverse landscapes with her parents. 
The vibrant observations will foster an appreciation for the country’s rich 
cultural and natural heritage.
vii
Unit 4 — ‘Travel and Adventure’ ignites the spirit of exploration and 
aims to cultivate curiosity, resilience, and a sense of wonder. The story, ‘The 
Tunnel’ will take students on an adventurous episode in a tunnel, highlighting 
the excitement of discovery and the courage to face the unknown. It also 
conveys the concept of maturing through self-exploration. The poem, ‘Travel’ 
revolves around the theme of exploring the unknown and a strong desire to 
travel. Train is used as a symbol to embark on to new adventures with new 
people. The sun’s journey is used as a metaphor for constant movement and 
the human urge for exploration. ‘Conquering the Summit’ is a non-fiction 
piece on Arunima Sinha, the first female amputee to scale Mount Everest 
to accomplish her dream. This will inspire students with her extraordinary 
determination and perseverance.
Unit 5 — ‘Bravehearts’ instills a sense of patriotism and gratitude in 
students, celebrating the courage and sacrifices of the valiant who have 
selflessly laid down their lives for the nation. ‘A Homage to Our Brave Soldiers’ 
is a tribute to the real heroes of our nation—our soldiers, the embodiment 
of patriotism. The poem ‘My Dear Soldiers’ is a heartfelt acknowledgement 
of the courage, dedication, and sacrifice of the soldiers who tirelessly defend 
the nation, often in harsh and unforgiving conditions. The graphic story of 
‘Rani Abbakka’ is a tale of a fearless queen, who defied Portuguese colonial 
powers with resilience and military acumen. She exhibited indomitable 
courage, valour, and determination. 
These literary pieces serve not only as sources of entertainment but 
also as repositories of valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth and 
equipping children with skills to navigate social situations with confidence. 
By resonating with children’s daily experiences, the selected pieces promote 
positive values such as resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence, 
thereby exerting a profound impact on their overall development. 
The primary focus lies in cultivating competencies in listening, speaking, 
reading, and writing while concurrently developing vocabulary and 
grammar in context. Language learning truly comes to life when connected 
to the immediate environment of learners, allowing them to express their 
thoughts, feelings, and experiences through experiential learning. All the 
activities are conveniently colour coded under headings such as―‘Let 
us discuss’, ‘Let us think and reflect’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us listen’, ‘Let us 
learn’, ‘Let us write’ and ‘Let us explore’. ‘Let us Explore’ extends learning 
beyond the text, staying within the unit’s theme. It aims to connect students 
with the Indian Knowledge System, fostering an appreciation for our rich 
heritage and culture, encouraging students to delve deeper, engage in 
viii
viii
meaningful discussions, and broaden their understanding. In-text activities 
and exercises at the end of each chapter are thoughtfully designed to be 
engaging, fostering joyful learning experiences while serving as tools for 
assessment as and for learning. Illustrations have been carefully crafted to 
depict context and enhance comprehension.
We sincerely hope that students will enjoy doing these activities, and 
develop language competencies.

Dear Ananda,
Hope you are all doing well!
Do you remember our last conversation about war and the 
importance of peace? We talked about how India had to 
struggle for its Independence from the British for many 
centuries. Post-independence our country has had to fight 
several wars to protect its borders, territorial integrity, and its 
people. This made me wonder, who were these brave Indian 
people? They fought to protect our country and sacrificed their 
lives so that we could lead our lives in peace. What were their 
names? Where did they come from? Does anyone remember 
anything about them?
Last week I got the answers to some of my questions during 
an educational trip to New Delhi organised by our school. You 
may recall, I was looking forward to this trip and our visit 
to many places of historical and educational significance. 
I learnt several new and interesting things, and I am excited 
to share them with you.
Let me begin by asking you to guess the name of the monument 
that I found most inspiring. Let’s see if you can guess. The 
construction of this monument started in April 2018 and 
was completed in February 2019. It was envisioned and then 
inaugurated by India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi

in February 2019. In terms of location and size, it is spread 
over 40 acres of land near the iconic India Gate. But more 
importantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest Indians. I’m 
sure you’ve guessed! It’s the ‘National War Memorial’. Won’t 
you say, a long-desired aspiration was fulfilled?
Our visit to the National War Memorial began with our teacher 
explaining that even after Independence, India has had to fight 
many wars to protect herself, and the freedom and security 
we enjoy today is because of the many brave men and women 
who have served in the Indian Armed Forces over decades. 
Sadly, she said, war always takes its toll, and therefore, many 
brave soldiers have had to sacrifice their lives for the country 
even after our Independence in 1947.
This is what makes monuments like the National War Memorial 
extremely important, so that we should never forget the cost 
of freedom. We are aware, always, of the pain and horrors 
of war. We learnt that each brick of the memorial is called a 
tablet, and it bears the names of soldiers who fought for India 
and made the supreme sacrifice in different wars from 1947 
till date, including the Indo-China conflict of 1962, the Indo-
Pak Wars in 1965 & 1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There 
are 29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names of fallen 
soldiers have been etched.
It was heartening to know that our government has recognised 
the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our teacher told us about the 21 
bravehearts who were awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), 
India’s highest wartime gallantry medal, for their service to 
the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), 
Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC), and Shaurya Chakra (SC).
Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India’s 
first PVC in the Battle of Badgam in 1947. Later some more 
PVCs were awarded for exceptional gallantry during the India-
China Conflict of 1962, and the India-Pakistan War of 1965. 
Besides, a PVC was also awarded for service during the UN 
Peace Keeping Operations in Congo.
In the 1971 war, some of the heroes who were awarded the 
PVC (posthumously) include Lance Naik Albert Ekka, Flying 
Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, Second Lieutenant Arun 
Khetarpal, and Major Hoshiar Singh. Some Navy personnel

Lance Naik Albert Ekka, (No. 4239746), 14 Guards
Lance Naik Albert Ekka was in the left forward company of a 
Battalion of the Brigade of Guards during their attack on the enemy 
defence at Gangasagar on the eastern front. This was a well-fortified 
position held in strength by the enemy. The assaulting troops were 
subjected to intense shelling and heavy small arms fire, but they 
charged on to the objective and were locked in bitter hand-to-hand 
combat. Lance Naik Albert Ekka noticed an enemy Light Machine 
Gun inflicting heavy casualties on his company. With complete 
disregard to his personal safety, he charged the enemy bunker, 
bayoneted two enemy soldiers and silenced the Light Machine Gun. 
Though seriously wounded in this encounter, he continued to fight 
alongside his comrades through the mile deep objective, clearing 
bunker after bunker with undaunted courage. Towards the northern 
end of the objective, one enemy Medium Machine Gun opened up 
from the second storey of a well-fortified building inflicting heavy 
casualties and holding up the attack. Once again, this gallant soldier 
without worrying about his personal safety, despite his serious 
injury and the heavy volume of enemy fire, crawled forward till he 
reached the building and lobbed a grenade through the loophole of 
including Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla were also awarded 
MVC for their exemplary courage and leadership.
Then the teacher shared with us the citation of Param Vir Chakra 
awardee Lance Naik Albert Ekka. It touched my heart and also 
motivated me. We were awestruck and humbled by his bravery. 
I aspire to be courageous like him when I join the army!

the bunker, killing one enemy and injuring the other. 
The Medium Machine Gun, however, continued to fire. With 
outstanding courage and grim determination, Lance Naik Albert 
Ekka scaled a side wall and entering the bunker, bayoneted the 
enemy who was still firing and thus silenced the Machine Gun, 
saving further casualties to his company and ensured the success 
of the attack. 
In this process, however, he received serious injuries and succumbed 
to them after the capture of the objective. In this action, Lance Naik 
Albert Ekka displayed the most conspicuous valour, determination 
and made the supreme sacrifice in the best traditions of the Army.

As we continued our visit around the National War Memorial, 
we came across another important installation called Amar 
Jawan Jyoti that commemorates our soldiers. The name, as 
you may have guessed, represents an immortal flame that 
is kept ablaze all through the day and night to revere the 
sacrifices of our soldiers. Earlier the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which 
also displayed a rifle and a helmet, was alighted under the 
arch of India Gate in January 1972 to commemorate India’s 
victory in the India-Pakistan War of 1971.

The National War Memorial now includes Amar 
Jawan Jyoti in the obelisk, which is surrounded by 
four Chakras. During the inauguration, the Prime 
Minister lit a new flame to commemorate the fallen 
heroes. Later, the old flame at India Gate was also 
merged with the new flame at the National War 
Memorial. Here is a picture of the new Amar Jawan 
Jyoti if you haven’t seen it. 
You can see the obelisk surrounded by wreaths 
that have been placed as a mark of respect. The 
lighting design is planned in such a way that it 
transforms the monument’s landscape as sunlight 
changes from dawn to dusk. It truly is a majestic 
site that filled me with pride for our nation. I was 
also overwhelmed by the interminable flame as a 
metaphor for eternal stories of courage and valour.

Our teacher also explained the significance of the Chakras to 
us. I found it interesting and hence I am sharing with you.
The National War Memorial consists of four concentric circles, 
which are known as Amar Chakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra, 
and Raksha Chakra around a 15-metre-tall central obelisk 
with the eternal flame—the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It also houses 
bronze and stone murals and graphic panels. Isn’t it amazing! 
The innermost circle represents the Amar Chakra, also 
known as the ‘Circle of Immortality’. This has the Obelisk with 
Eternal Flame. The Amar Jawan Jyoti flame symbolises the 
immortality of the spirit of fallen soldiers with the assurance 
that the nation will never forget their sacrifice.
The second circle is called the Veerta Chakra, which is also 
known as the ‘Circle of Bravery’. There is a covered gallery 
that exhibits six murals crafted in bronze, depicting valiant 
battle actions of our Armed Forces.
The third circle represents the Tyag Chakra, also known 
as the ‘Circle of Sacrifice’. The circular concentric walls of 
honour symbolise the ancient war formation, which is called 
Chakravyuh. The walls are covered with granite tablets and 
murals: large

The outermost circle represents the Raksha Chakra, which 
is also known as the ‘Circle of Protection’. In this chakra the 
row of trees is a reassurance to the citizens of the country 
about their safety against any threat. Each tree represents the 
soldiers who ensure the territorial integrity of the nation. 
We spent the whole day, from morning to evening, at the 
National War Memorial and the surrounding areas, marked by 
majestic lawns and grand buildings of Kartavyapath. We were 
immersed in the ambience that was solemn and a reminder 
of what a free nation could achieve. The overall environment 
created an emotive experience that was visually inspiring. I 
felt as if I had developed a bond with the place.
I learnt a lot, but I also have to admit that the various discourses 
during the day brought tears to my eyes. It was sad to think 
about the massive devastation and loss of life caused by wars. 
It motivated me to live a life worthy of the sacrifices of our 
heroes.
After our visit, the class decided to make presentations on 
stories of valour of the bravehearts we came across at the 
National War Memorial. We divided ourselves into five 
groups. We decided to make 
presentations 
depicting 
the 
courageous 
stories 
of 
the 
soldiers. 
Our 
teacher 
has 
also advised us to share our 
experience during the school 
assembly. I am delighted that 
all the students of our school 
will get to know about the 
National War Memorial and 
the soldiers it commemorates.

a 
presentation on the story of 
Major Padmapani Acharya, 
who fought for India in the 
1999 Kargil War and was 
awarded the Maha Vir Chakra.
Major Padmapani Acharya (MVC) 
Poorvi
186
Before he went into battle, he wrote a letter to his father that 
he wasn’t afraid or scared about losing his life while trying to 
protect the motherland. Quoting Shrimad Bhagavad Gita he went 
on to say:
Gazette Notification: 17 Pres/2000,15.8.99 Operation:
Op Vijay- Kargil Date of Award: 15 Aug 1999
Citation
Major Padmapani Acharya (IC-55072) 2 Rajputana Rifles
(Posthumous)
On 28 June 1999, Major Padmapani Acharya as a Company Commander, 
was assigned the formidable task of capturing an enemy position 
which was heavily fortified, strongly held and covered with mines and 
sweeping machine gun and artillery fire.
Success of the battalion and brigade operation hinged on the early 
capture of this position. However, the company attack almost faltered at 
the very beginning when the enemy’s artillery fire came down squarely 
on the leading platoon, inflicting large number of casualties.
With utter disregard to his personal safety, Major Padmapani Acharya 
took the reserve platoon of his company and led it through raining 
artillery shells. Even as his men were falling to the murderous enemy 
fire, he continued to encourage his men and charged at the enemy up 
the steep rock face with his reserve platoon.
Unmindful of the hail of bullets from the enemy’s position, Major 
Padmapani Acharya crawled up to the enemy position and lobbed 
grenades. In this daring assault, Major Acharya was severely injured. 
Despite being seriously injured and unable to move, he ordered his men 
to leave him and charge at the enemy while he continued to fire at the 
enemy. The enemy position was finally over-run and the objective was 
captured.
After completion of the mission, the officer however, succumbed to his 
injuries.
Major Padmapani Acharya displayed exceptional courage, leadership 
and spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy.

Dear Soumya,
It was such a pleasure to receive your letter. I enjoyed reading 
your experience of the visit to the National War Memorial in 
Delhi, as well as your observations and feelings during the 
visit. You really have an eye for detail, and being the sensitive 
person that you are, you have been able to capture the essence 
of the emotions associated with this memorial.
I was happy to hear that you got an opportunity to visit the 
National War Memorial. I have heard a lot about it. Some 
people might see a war memorial as just a monument, 
statue, an edifice to celebrate our war heroes or victory and 
commemorate those who lost their lives or got injured in the 
war. In my view, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for 
the supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers defending 
the sovereignty and integrity of the country. I feel motivated 
and I am seriously thinking of joining the Armed Forces to 
serve my motherland.
I also feel it is our duty to periodically visit such places to 
honour our valiant soldiers, who have made great sacrifices 
for us. Their sacrifices enable us to walk freely in our country 
without fear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher and 
school to arrange this visit to give you all a chance to learn 
about India’s heroes and also pay your respect to them. The 
idea of your class to make a presentation at the school and 
make everyone a part of your experience is wonderful! Best of

luck for your presentation, I hope it goes well and motivates the 
school students to join the Indian Armed Forces. 
Your letter has reminded me of a time when we visited the war 
memorial in our city. While visiting one of Chandigarh’s gardens, 
we saw a lot of activity around the Bougainvillea Garden in Sector 3. 
As we approached the garden, we saw people offering flowers and 
prayers. We joined the group out of curiosity and quickly realised 
that they were all there to pay respect to the soldiers at the War 
Memorial located in the heart of the garden.
When I think back about my visit where everyone was dedicating 
flowers as a mark of respect to our soldiers, I was reminded of 
the following poem:
Pushp ki Abhilasha
Chaah Nahi, Main Sur Bala Ke Gehanon 
Mein Goontha Jaaun, 
Chaah Nahi, Premi-Mala Mein Bandh 
Pyaari Ko Lalchaaun!
Chaah Nahi, Samraaton Ke Shav
Par, Hey Hari, Dala Jaaun,
Chaah Nahi Devon Ke Sir Par
Chadhoon, Bhagya Par Ithlaun!
Mujhe Tod Lena, Vanmali!
Us Path Per Dena Tum Phaink,
Matrabhoomi Per Sheesh Chadhane
Jis Path Jaavein Veer Anek!

I hope you like the poem. I must say, I was inspired by your 
idea of presenting the valourous stories of India’s soldiers. 
There are so many stories of courage, bravery and sacrifice 
which remind us that many of the challenges we face in our 
lives are inconsequential. We can enjoy peace in our country 
and the luxury of exchanging ideas with our friends because 
our Armed Forces are alert and work hard to create that 
environment for us. 
Very recently, I read in the 
newspaper that Captain Anuj 
Nayyar, MVC, an Indian Army 
officer of the 17 Jat regiment was 
posthumously awarded the Maha 
Vir Chakra, India’s second highest 
gallantry award, for exemplary 
valour during the Kargil War in 
1999. I look forward to learning 
more about him. Meanwhile, I learnt that his mother Meena 
Nayyar has written a memoir titled Tiger of Drass– Capt. Anuj 
Nayyar – 23 – Kargil Hero, which I shall certainly go through. 
I am sharing with you an excerpt of her interview with IANS.
Captain Anuj Nayyar, MahaVir Chakra
“Writing about the smallest things about your child who is not with 
you really used to shake me, but gradually I came to terms with it 
by telling myself that if I didn’t write about him no one would know 
about Anuj’s sacrifice.”

Next week, I am going to share this idea with my classmates and 
my teacher. I think it would be great to create a collage capturing 
the lives and stories of people that can inspire us each day.
I know that we can email each other. I really like to receive 
letters from you, not just because of the ideas that you share 
but also because the envelope of your letters often comes with 
beautiful stamps, which make me happy. I don’t know if I ever 
shared it before, but collecting stamps is one of my favourite 
hobbies. I’ve been doing it for years. But I learnt recently that the 
act of collecting stamps is called ‘philately’. This time I received 
a stamp that celebrates India’s independence, a theme related to 
your letter. 
Okay, that’s all from me for now. 
But before I conclude, guess what 
we had for breakfast! Fluffy idlis 
and we all remembered you. Give 
my regards to your parents.
I am inspired by your letter!
Hope to hear from you soon 
about your new adventures and 
experiences.

Homage to Our Brave Soldiers
	
Let us listen (refer to page 196)
	
	 You will listen to a girl speak about why she wishes to join the Armed 
Forces when she grows up. As you listen, answer the questions given 
below in two–three exact words you hear.
Good morning, respected teachers and my dear friends.
Today, I, Gunjan, of Grade 7-C, stand before you to share why I 
dream of joining the Indian Armed Forces when I grow up. 
Serving our country is the most honourable job one can have. 
It means protecting and securing our nation, even if it means 
risking one’s life. The thought of wearing the uniform, which 
can only be earned through hard work, fills me with pride and a 
strong desire to serve India.
The Armed Forces teach you to live a disciplined and organised 
life. This keeps both the mind and body active. Soldiers are always 
ready to face challenges because of this discipline. Additionally, 
regular exercise and training keep soldiers physically fit and 
ready for any situation. This preparation is something I greatly 
admire and wish to achieve.
Lastly, being a soldier means having new experiences and 
adventures everyday. Each day brings new challenges, teaching 
important lessons, and helping one grow. The Armed Forces 
offer a life filled with honour, self-respect, safety, and security 
for both the soldier and their families. It is a life that teaches 
loyalty, duty, service, and honesty. 
This is why I want to join the Indian Armed Forces. 
Thank you.

In fields so vast, our soldiers stand, 
With hearts so brave, and firm command, 
They guard our land both night and day, 
To keep our fears and foes at bay.
With every dawn and setting sun, 
Their duty calls, it must be done, 
Through stormy skies and blazing heat, 
They march along with steady feet.
For love of land, they fight and strive, 
To keep our hopes and dreams alive, 
With pride and honour, they defend, 
Our India, till the very end.

Let us listen (refer to page 220)
	You will listen to the teacher speak about a braveheart. As you listen, 
complete the bio-table given below. 
Hello children, you all have read about Rani Abbakka. Let me 
share with you some details about one more braveheart. Her 
name is Rani Gaidinliu.
Gaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915, in the present-day 
Tamenglong district of Manipur. She was a Naga leader who led 
an armed uprising against the British in Manipur, Nagaland, and 
Assam. Gaidinliu belonged to the Rongmei tribe, also known as 
the Kabui tribe.
224
Poorvi
In 1927, at the age of 13, Gaidinliu joined the Heraka movement. 
This movement aimed at the revival of the Naga tribal religion 
and the establishment of self-rule for the Nagas, ending  
British rule.
Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 when she was just 16 and was 
sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. Between 
1932 and 1947, she was kept in several prisons across the 
Northeast.
After being released in 1947, she continued to work for the 
betterment of her community. The then Prime Minister described 
Gaidinliu as the ‘Daughter of the Hills’ and gave her the title ‘Rani’ 
for her courage. She was also awarded the Padma Bhushan in 
1982.
In 1991, Rani Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace, where she 
died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78. Rani Gaidinliu was 
conferred the Birsa Munda Award posthumously. 
The State Government has developed a park along with a statue 
to honour Rani Gaidinliu in Silchar, Assam. Not only that, the 
Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996 
and a commemorative coin in 2015. 
What a braveheart indeed!

foreword
The National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends that 
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the 
school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of 
bookish learning which continues to shape our system and 
causes a gap between the school, home and community. The 
syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify 
an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt 
to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp 
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these 
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of 
a child-centred system of education outlined in the National 
Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that 
school principals and teachers will take to encourage 
children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue 
imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise 
that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new 
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to 
them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole 
basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other 
resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating 
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat 
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed 
body of knowledge. 
These aims imply considerable change in school routines 
and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is 
as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar 
so that the required number of teaching days are actually 
devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and 
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook 
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, 
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers 
have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by 
Reprint 2024-25

restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages 
with greater consideration for child psychology and the time 
available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this 
endeavor by giving higher priority and space to opportunities 
for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, 
and activities requiring hands-on experience. 
NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook 
development committee responsible for this book. We wish 
to thank the Chairperson of the Advisory Group on Social 
Science, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor 
for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya for guiding 
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to 
the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their 
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to 
the institutions and organisations, which have generously 
permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and 
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of 
the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the 
Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of 
Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship 
of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G. P. Deshpande, for 
their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation 
committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement 
in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments 
and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further 
revision and refinement.

Rationalisation of Content  
in the Textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce 
content load on students. The National Education Policy 
2020, also emphasises upon reducing the content load and 
providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative 
mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken 
the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. 
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across 
classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view 
of the following
•	
Overlapping with similar content included in other subject 
areas in the same class
•	
Similar content included in the lower or higher class  
in the same subject
•	
High difficulty level
•	
Content, which is easily accessible to students without 
much interventions from teachers and can be learned by 
children through self-learning or peer-learning.
•	
Content, which is not relevant in the present context or 
outdated.
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying 
out the changes given above.

Understanding Delhi under the Sultans
Histories are known as 
 (singular)/
 
(plural), in Persian, the language of administration 
under the Delhi Sultans.
The authors of 
 were learned men: 
secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, 
who both recounted events and advised rulers on 
governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. 
The circle of justice 
Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century:   
 A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot 
live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected 
from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when 
they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king 
promotes justice and honest governance.
Do you think the 
circle of justice 
is an appropriate 
term to describe 
the relationship 
between the king 
and his subjects? 
Birthright
Privileges claimed 
on account of 
birth. For example, 
people believed 
that nobles 
inherited their 
rights to govern, 
because they were 
born in certain 
families.
Gender 
distinctions
Social and 
biological 
differences 
between women 
and men. Usually, 
these differences 
are used to argue 
that men are 
superior to women. 
Keep the following additional details in mind:  
(1) the authors of 
 lived in cities (mainly 
Delhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote 
their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards.  
(3) These authors advised rulers on the need to 
preserve an “ideal” social order based on birthright 
and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared 
by everybody.
 In 1236 Sultan Iltutmish’s daughter, Raziyya, 
became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, 
Minhaj-us-Siraj, recognised that she was more able 
comfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the 
nobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. 
She was removed from the throne in 1240.
33
DELHI: 12TH TO 15TH... 
What Minhaj-us-Siraj thought about  
Raziyya: What other important  
female rulers of India did?
Minhaj-us-Siraj thought that the queen’s rule went 
against the ideal social order created by God, in which 
women were supposed to be subordinate to men. He 
therefore asked: “In the register of God’s creation, since 
her account did not fall under the column of men, how 
did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?” 
On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned 
that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. 
This was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi  
(1262–1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, 
part of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi 
changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended 
she was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in 
Kashmir (980–1003). Her title is interesting: it comes 
from “didi” or “elder sister”, an obviously affectionate 
term given to a loved ruler by her subjects. 
Express Minhaj’s ideas in your own words. Do you 
think Raziyya shared these ideas? Why do you 
think it was so difficult for a woman to be a ruler? 
?
A Closer Look: Administration under 
the Khaljis and Tughluqs
The consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the    
Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and 
administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats 
and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi 
Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special 
slaves purchased for military service, called 
 
in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some

the Sultan could trust and rely upon them.

Can you think of any reason why a slave would

The Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use 
 
and also raised people of humble birth, who were often 
their clients, to high political positions. They were 
appointed as generals and governors. However, this 
also introduced an element of political instability. 
Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and 
patrons, but not to their heirs. Sultans had their own 
servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch 
The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi 
Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors

Officials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq 
Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, 
a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka 
Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and 
Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, 
a mid-fourteenth-century chronicler, reported their 
appointments as a sign of the Sultan’s loss of political 
judgement and his incapacity to rule. 
Why do you think Barani criticised the Sultan?

Like the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq 
monarchs appointed military commanders as 
governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands 
were called

harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed 
during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad 
Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to 
check the amount of revenue collected by the 
. 
Care was taken that the 
 collected only the taxes 
prescribed by the state and that he kept the required 
number of soldiers. 
As the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of 
the cities under their control, they forced the landed 
chieftains – the 
aristocrats – and rich landlords 
to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the 
state brought the assessment and collection of land 
revenue under its own control. The rights of the local 
chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were 
also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan’s administrators 
measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of 
the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate 
as revenue collectors and assessors. There were 
three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called 
 
and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant’s 
produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses.
It is important to remember that large parts of 
the subcontinent remained outside the control of 
provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after 
annexing southern India, the entire region became 
independent. Even in the Gangetic plain, there

these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji

these areas but only for a short duration.

Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol 
attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the 
reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of 
Muhammad Tughluq’s rule. This forced the two rulers 
to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed 
a huge administrative challenge.

uling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent  
 with such a diversity of people and cultures was an 
the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their predecessors, 
the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what 
had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods 
of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century, 
they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, 
until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly 
all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of 
administration and ideas of governance that outlasted 
their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding 
rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today 
the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on 
Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort 
in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors.

Who were the Mughals?
The Mughals were descendants 
of two great lineages of rulers. 
From their mother’s side they were 
descendants of Genghis Khan (died 
1227), the Mongol ruler who ruled 
over parts of China and Central 
Asia. From their father’s side, they 
were the successors of Timur (died 
1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and  
modern-day Turkey. However, 
the Mughals did not like to be 
called Mughal or Mongol. This was 
because Genghis Khan’s memory 
was associated with the massacre 
of innumerable people. It was also 
linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol 
competitors. On the other hand, the 
Mughals were proud of their Timurid 
ancestry, not least of all because 
their great ancestor had captured

he was only 12 years old. He 
was forced to leave his ancestral 
throne due to the invasion of 
another Mongol group, the Uzbegs. 
After years of wandering, he 
seized Kabul in 1504. In 1526 he

41
THE MUGHALS
Mughal Traditions of Succession 
The Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture, 
where the eldest son inherited his father’s estate. 
Instead they followed the Mughal and Timurid 
custom of coparcenary inheritance, or a division of 
the inheritance amongst all the sons. Which do you 
think is a fairer division of inheritance: primogeniture 
or coparcenary?
Mughal Relations with Other Rulers
The Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against 
rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as 
the Mughals became powerful many other rulers 
also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good 
example of this. Many of them married their daughters 
into Mughal families and received high positions. But 
many resisted as well. 
Mughal marriages 
with the Rajputs 
The mother of 
Jahangir was                   
a Kachhwaha 
princess, daughter 
of the Rajput 
ruler of Amber 
(modern- day 
Jaipur). The 
mother of Shah 
Jahan was a Rathor 
princess, daughter 
of the Rajput 
ruler of Marwar 
(Jodhpur).

Mansabdars and Jagirdars
As the empire expanded to encompass different 
regions, the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of 
people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles 
(Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian 
Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other 
groups. Those who joined Mughal service were

so that their revenues were 
roughly equal to the salary

Aurangzeb’s reign, this was

actual revenue collected was 
often less than the granted

increase in the number of

factors created a shortage in the number of

As a result, many 
 tried to extract as much 
revenue as possible while they had a 
. Aurangzeb 
was unable to control these developments in the 
last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore  
suffered tremendously. 
Zabt and Zamindars 
The main source of income available to Mughal 
rulers was tax on the produce of the peasantry. In 
most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural 
elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The 
Mughals used one term – zamindars – to describe all 
intermediaries, whether they were local headmen 
of villages or powerful chieftains.
Akbar’s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried 
out a careful survey of crop yields, prices 
and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 
was divided into revenue circles with its own 
schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. 
This revenue system was known as 
. It 
was prevalent in those areas where Mughal 
administrators could survey the land and keep 
very careful accounts. This was not possible in  
provinces, such as Gujarat and Bengal.

In some areas, the zamindars exercised a great deal 
of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators 
and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling 
against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts 
challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from 
the end of the seventeenth century.

 Akbar Nama and Ain-i Akbari
Akbar ordered one of his close friends and 
courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of 
his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume 
history of Akbar’s reign, titled Akbar 
Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar’s 
ancestors and the second volume recorded 
the events of Akbar’s reign. The third 
volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with 
Akbar’s administration, household, army, 
the revenues and the geography of his 
empire. It also provides rich details about 
the traditions and culture of the people 
living in India. The most interesting aspect 
about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical 
details about things as diverse as crops, 
yields, prices, wages and revenues.

THE MUGHALS
Sulh-i kul
Jahangir, Akbar’s son, described his father’s policy of 
sulh-i kul in the following words: 
As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room 
for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so … in his 
Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by 
the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, 
and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was 
closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians 
and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the 
principle of “universal peace” (sulh-i kul).
The Mughal Empire in the Seventeenth 
Century and After
The administrative and military efficiency of the 
Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial 
prosperity. International travellers described it as the 
fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were 
also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side 
by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities 
were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of 
 were only 445 in number out of a total

cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as 
salaries for themselves and their troopers. 
The Mughal emperors and their 
 spent 
a great deal of their income on salaries and goods.   
who supplied them with goods and produce. But the 
scale of revenue collection left very little for investment 
in the hands of the primary producers – the peasant 
and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived  
from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider 
investing in additional resources – tools and supplies – 
46
to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and 
in this economic world.
The enormous wealth and resources commanded 
by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful 
group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the 
authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his 
servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the 
regions. They constituted new dynasties and held the 
command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. 
Although they continued to recognise the Mughal 
emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth 
century the provinces of the empire had consolidated 
their independent political identities.

TRIBES, NOMADS AND
SETTLED COMMUNITIES
Y
ou saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 how kingdoms  
rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new arts, 
and villages. Over the centuries important political, 
social and economic developments had taken place. 
But social change was not the same everywhere, 
because different kinds of societies evolved 
differently. It is important to understand 
how and why this happened.
In large parts of the subcontinent, society 
was already divided according to the rules 
of 
. These rules, as prescribed by the 
Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers 
of large kingdoms. The difference between 
the high and low, and between the rich and 
poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans 
and the Mughals, this hierarchy between 
social classes grew further. 
Beyond Big Cities: Tribal 
Societies 
There were, however, other kinds of 
societies as well. Many societies in the 
subcontinent did not follow the social rules 
and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. 
Nor were they divided into numerous 
unequal classes. Such societies are often 
called tribes. 
TRIBES, NOMADS AND 
SETTLED COMMUNITIES

Members of each tribe were united by kinship 
bonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from 
agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. 
Most often they combined these activities to make 
full use of the natural resources of the area in which 
they lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved 
from one place to another. A tribal group controlled 
land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst 
households according to its own rules. 
Many large tribes thrived in different parts of the 
subcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills, 
clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies. 
In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and 
preserved their separate culture. 
But the caste-based and tribal societies also 
depended on each other for their diverse needs. This 
caused both societies to change.
Who were Tribal People? 
Contemporary historians and travellers give very 
scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions 
apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But 
they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These 
were passed down to each new generation. Present-
day historians have started using such oral traditions 
to write tribal histories. 
Tribal people were found in almost every region of 
varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes 
controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar 
fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became 
more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, 
was made a noble (
) by Emperor Akbar. In 
Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated 
extensive regions before they were subdued by the 
Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful

tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many 
smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western 
Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The 
distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was 
entirely dominated by tribes – the Nagas, Ahoms and 
many others.
In many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, 
Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. 
Raja Man Singh, Akbar’s famous general, attacked 
and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of 
booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely 
subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured 
many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The 
Mundas and Santals were among the other important 
tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa  
and Bengal.

The Maharashtra highlands and 
Karnataka were home to Kolis, 
Berads and numerous others. 
Kolis also lived in many areas of 
Gujarat. Further south there were 
large tribal populations of Koragas, 
Vetars, Maravars and many others.
The large tribe of Bhils was 
spread across western and central 
India. By the late sixteenth 
century, many of them had 
become settled agriculturists and 
some even zamindars. Many Bhil 
clans, nevertheless, remained  
hunter-gatherers. The Gonds were 
found in great numbers across the 
present-day states of Chhattisgarh, 
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and 
Andhra Pradesh.
How Nomads and 
Mobile People Lived
Nomadic pastoralists moved 
over long distances with their 
animals. They lived on milk and 
other pastoral products. They also 
exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with 
settled agriculturists for grain, 
cloth, utensils and other products.

They bought and sold these goods as they moved 
from one place to another, transporting them on their 
animals.
The Banjaras were the most important trader-
nomads. Their caravan was called 
. Sultan 
Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to 
transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir 
wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain 
on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in 
towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal 
army during military campaigns. With a large army 
there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain.
The Banjaras
Peter Mundy, an English trader who came to India 
during the early seventeenth century, has described 
the Banjaras:
 In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with 14,000 
oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and 
rice ... These Banjaras carry their household – wives and 
children – along with them. One tanda consists of many 
families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who 
continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. 
They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly 
they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is 
cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. 
From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that 
more than 6 or 7 miles a day – that, too, in the cool weather. 
After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as 
there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them.

to cities at present. In what ways is this similar 
to or different from the ways in which the  
Banjaras functioned?

Many pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, 
such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. 
Different castes of petty pedlars 
also travelled from village to 
village. They made and 
sold wares such as ropes, 
reeds, straw matting and 
coarse sacks. Sometimes 
mendicants acted as 
wandering merchants. There 
were castes of entertainers who performed in different 
towns and villages for their livelihood. 
Changing Society: New Castes and 
Hierarchies
As the economy and the needs of society grew, people 
with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or 
, emerged within 
. For example, new castes 
appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other  
hand, many tribes and social groups were taken 
into caste-based society and given the status of

masons – were also recognised as separate

the Brahmanas.

Deliberations on jati 
A twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, 
in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), 
describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of 
Brahmanas. 
They deliberated on the status of a group known as 
rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down 
their occupations, which were to include architecture, 
building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways 
for temples with images in them, preparing wooden 
equipment used to perform sacrifices, building 
mandapas, making jewels for the king.

TRIBES, NOMADS AND
SETTLED COMMUNITIES
Among the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became 
powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. 
They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, 
Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, 
had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to 
be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the 
older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a 
developed society was emerging, and rulers used their 
wealth to create powerful states. 
The rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set 
an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, 
with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes 
became a part of the caste system. But only the leading 
tribal families could join the ruling class. A large 
majority joined the lower 
 of caste society. On the 
other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and 
the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. 
They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal 
social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was 
not widely accepted in these areas. 
The emergence of states is closely related to social 
change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this 
important part of our history are described below.
A Closer Look
The Gonds
The Gonds lived in a vast forested region called 
Gondwana – or “country inhabited by Gonds”. They 
practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe 
was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan 
had its own raja or 
. About the time that the power 
of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond 
kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller 
Gond chiefs. The 
, a history of Akbar’s 
reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga 
that had 70,000 villages. 
The administrative system of these kingdoms was 
becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into

. Each 
 was controlled 
by a particular Gond clan. This 
was further divided into units of 
84 villages called 
. The 
 was subdivided into 
 which were made up of 
12 villages each.
The emergence of large states 
changed the nature of Gond 
society. Their basically equal 
society gradually got divided   
into unequal social classes. 
Brahmanas received land grants 
from the Gond rajas and became 
now wished to be recognised 
as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the 
Gond raja of Garha Katanga, 
assumed the title of Sangram 
Shah. His son, Dalpat, married 
princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the 
Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. 
Dalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very 
her, the kingdom became 
even more extensive. In 
1565, the Mughal forces 
under Asaf Khan attacked 
Garha Katanga. A strong 
resistance was put up by Rani 
Durgawati.  She was defeated 
and preferred to die rather 
than surrender. Her son, too, 
Garha Katanga was a rich 
state. It earned much wealth 
by trapping and exporting wild 
elephants to other kingdoms. 
When the Mughals defeated 
57
TRIBES, NOMADS AND
SETTLED COMMUNITIES
the Gonds, they captured a huge booty 
of precious coins and elephants. They 
annexed part of the kingdom and granted 
the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir 
Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, 
the Gond kingdoms survived for some 
time. However, they became much weaker 
and later struggled unsuccessfully against 
the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. 
The Ahoms
The Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra 
valley from present-day Myanmar in the 
thirteenth century. They created a new 
state by suppressing the older political 
system of the 
 (landlords). 
During the sixteenth century, they 
annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas 
(1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and 
subjugated many other tribes. The 
Ahoms built a large state, and for this 
quality gunpowder and cannons.
However, the Ahoms faced many 
invasions from the south-west. In 1662, 
the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked 
the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave 
defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But 
direct Mughal control over the region 
could not last long. 
The Ahom state depended upon forced 
labour. Those forced to work for the 
state were called 
. A census of the 
population was taken. Each village had 
to send a number of 
 by rotation. 
People from heavily populated areas 
were shifted to less populated places. 
Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the 
administration became quite centralised.

Almost all adult males served in the army during 
war. At other times, they were engaged in building 
dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The 
Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation.
Ahom society was divided into clans or 
. There 
were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the 
Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A 
 
often controlled several villages. The peasant was given 
land by his village community. Even the king could not 
take it away without the community’s consent.
Originally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal 
however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. 
Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the 
king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714 –1744), Hinduism 
became the predominant religion.  But the Ahom kings 
did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after 
adopting Hinduism.
Ahom society was very sophisticated. Poets 
and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was 
encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were 
translated into the local language. Historical Chronicles, 
known as 
language and then in Assamese.
Conclusion
Considerable social change took place in the subcontinent 
during the period we have been examining. 
-based 
society and tribal people constantly interacted with each 
other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies 
to adapt and change. There were many different tribes 
and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of 
time, many of them merged with caste-based society. 
Others, however, rejected both the caste system and 
orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive 
states with well-organised systems of administration. 
They thus became politically powerful. This brought 
them into conflict with larger and more complex 
kingdoms and empire

DEVOTIONAL PATHS
TO THE DIVINE
Y
ou may have seen people perform rituals of  
worship, or singing 
, 
 or 
, 
or even repeating the name of God in silence, and 
noticed that some of them are moved to tears. Such 
intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various 
since the eighth century.
The Idea of a Supreme God
Before large kingdoms emerged, different groups   
of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses. 
As people were brought together through the growth 
of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to 
develop. The idea that all living things pass through 
countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good 
deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, 
the idea that all human beings are not equal even at 
birth gained ground during this period. The belief that 
social privileges came from birth in a “noble” family or 
a “high” caste was the subject of many learned texts.
Many people were uneasy with such ideas and 
turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas 
according to which it was possible to overcome social 
differences and break the cycle of rebirth through 
personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a 
Supreme God who could deliver humans from such 
bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). 
This idea, advocated in the 
 grew in 
popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era.  
DEVOTIONAL PATHS 
TO THE DIVINE
The beginning of 
Bhakti
Worship of certain 
deities, which 
became a central 
feature of later 
Hinduism, gained in 
importance. These 
deities included 
Shiva, Vishnu, and 
goddesses such as 
Durga. These deities 
were worshipped 
through Bhakti, an 
idea that became 
very popular at 
this time. Bhakti is 
generally understood 
as a person’s 
devotion to his or 
her chosen deity. 
Anybody, whether 
rich or poor, belonging 
to the so-called ‘high’ 
or ‘low’ castes, man 
or woman, could 
follow the path of 
Bhakti. The idea of 
Bhakti is present in 
the Bhagavad Gita, a 
sacred book of  
the Hindus.

identified with 
Shi va, Vish n u 
or Durga. In the 
process, local myths and legends became a part of the 
Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended 
in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. 
Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was 
possible for devotees to receive the grace of God 
regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti 
became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas 
adopted these beliefs.
Bhakti in South India –  
Nayanars and Alvars
The seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of 
new religious movements, led by the Nayanars (saints 
devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu) 
who came from all castes including those considered 
“untouchable” like the Pulaiyar and the Panars. They 
were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas 
and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the 
path to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love 
and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the 
earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during 
the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended 
them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and 
Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite 
poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages 
they visited, and set them to music.
You can observe 
this process of 
local myths and 
legends receiving 
wider acceptance 
even today. Can 
you find some

DEVOTIONAL PATHS
TO THE DIVINE
Nayanars and Alvars
There were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different 
social backgrounds, such as potters, “untouchable” 
workers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and 
chiefs. The best known among them were Appar, 
Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are 
two sets of compilations of their songs – Tevaram and 
Tiruvacakam. 
There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally  
divergent backgrounds, the best known being 
Periyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar 
and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya 
Prabandham.
Between the tenth and twelfth centuries, the Chola 
and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many 
of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening 
the links between the bhakti tradition and temple 
worship. This was also the time when their poems 
were compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious 
biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also 
composed. Today we use these texts as sources for 
writing histories of the bhakti tradition.

Philosophy and Bhakti 
of India, was born in Kerala in the eighth century. 
He was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of 
the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme 
God which is the Ultimate Reality. He taught that 
Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless 
and without any attributes. He considered the world 
around us to be an illusion or 
, and preached 
renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of 
knowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman 
and attain salvation.  
Ramanuja, born in Tamil Nadu in the eleventh 
century, was deeply influenced by the Alvars. 
According to him the best means of attaining 
salvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu. 
Vishnu in His grace helps the devotee to attain the 
bliss of union with Him. He propounded the doctrine 
even when united with the Supreme God remained 
distinct. Ramanuja’s doctrine greatly inspired the 
new strand of bhakti which developed in north  
India subsequently.  
Basavanna’s Virashaivism
We noted earlier the connection between the Tamil 
bhakti movement and temple worship. This in turn 
led to a reaction that is best represented in the 
Virashaiva movement initiated by Basavanna and his 
companions like Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi. 
This movement began in Karnataka in the

Virashaiva vachanas
These are vachanas or sayings attributed to Basavanna:
The rich,
Will make temples for Shiva.
What shall I, 
A poor man,
Do?
My legs are pillars,
The body the shrine,
The head a cupola
Of gold.
Listen, O Lord of the meeting rivers,
Things standing shall fall,
But the moving ever shall stay.
What is the temple that Basavanna is offering to God?
Bhakti Movement in the Decean
From the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries, 
Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose 
songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people. 
The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar 
(Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well 
as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, 
who belonged to the “untouchable” Mahar caste. This 
regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a 
form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on 
the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of 
all people. 
These saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, 
outward display of piety and social differences 
based on birth. In fact, they even rejected the idea of 
renunciation and preferred to live with their families, 
earning their livelihood like any other person, while 
humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new 
humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti 
66
lay in sharing others’ pain. As the famous Gujarati 
saint Narsi Mehta said, “They are Vaishnavas who 
understand the pain of others.”
Questioning the social order
This is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant 
Tukaram: 
with the battered and the beaten
Mark him as a saint
For God is with him
He holds
Every forsaken man
Close to his heart 
He treats 
A slave
As his own son
Says Tuka
I won’t be tired 
to repeat again
Such a man
Is God 
In person.
 Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela’s son:
You made us low caste,
Why don’t you face that fact, Great Lord?
Our whole life – left-over food to eat.
You should be ashamed of this.
You have eaten in our home.
How can you deny it?
Chokha’s (son) Karmamela asks
Why did you give me life?

in these compositions.

Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis
A number of religious groups that 
emerged during this period criticised the 
ritual and other aspects of conventional 
religion and the social order, using 
simple, logical arguments. Among them 
were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas 
and Yogis. They advocated renunciation 
of the world. To them the path to 
salvation lay in meditation on the 
formless Ultimate Reality and the 
realisation of oneness with it. To achieve 
this, they advocated intense training of 
the mind and body through practices 
like 
, breathing exercises 
and meditation. These groups became 
particularly popular among “low” castes. 
Their criticism of conventional religion 
created the ground for devotional

 Finding the Lord 
Jalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet 
from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from 
his work:
He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu 
temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on 
Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna 
looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was 
in no other place.
New Religious Developments in  
North India
The period after the thirteenth century saw 
a new wave of the bhakti movement in North 
India. This was an age when Islam, Brahmanical 
another. We saw that new kingdoms (Chapters 2, 3  
and 4) were emerging, and people were taking up new 
people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and 
labourers, thronged to listen to these 
new saints and spread their ideas.
Some of them like Kabir and Baba 
Guru Nanak rejected all orthodox 
religions. Others like Tulsidas and 
Surdas accepted existing beliefs  
and practices but wanted to make 
these accessible to all. Tulsidas 
conceived of God in the form of 
Rama. Tulsidas’s composition, the 
 written in Awadhi

Pradesh), is important both as an

This tradition also included saints like Dadu Dayal, 
Ravidas and Mirabai. Mirabai was a Rajput princess 
married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth 
century. Mirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint 
from a caste considered “untouchable”. She was

devoted to Krishna and composed innumerable

also openly challenged the norms of the “upper” castes 
and became popular with the masses in Rajasthan 
and Gujarat.
A unique feature of most of the saints is that their 
works were composed in regional languages and could 
be sung. They became immensely popular and were 
handed down orally from generation to generation. 
Usually the poorest, most deprived communities and 
women transmitted these songs, often adding their own 
experiences. Thus the songs as we have them today are 
as much a creation of the saints as of generations of 
people who sang them. They have become a part of our 
living popular culture.

have little reliable information about his life. We get 
to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses 
called 
 and 
 said to have been composed 
by him and sung by wandering 
singers. Some 
of these were later collected and preserved in the 
 
 and 
.
In search of the True Lord
Here is a composition of Kabir: 
O Allah-Ram present in all living beings
Have mercy on your servants, O Lord!
Why bump your head on the ground,
Why bathe your body in water?
You kill and you call yourself “humble”
But your vices you conceal.
Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps 
the ekadasi fast
While the Qazi observes the Ramzan
Tell me why does he set aside the eleven 
months 
To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth?
Hari dwells in the East, they say
And Allah resides in the West,
Search for him in your heart, in the heart 
of your heart;
There he dwells, Rahim-Ram.

to or different from those of Basavanna and  
Jalaluddin Rumi?

Kabir’s teachings were based on a complete, indeed 
vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. 
His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external 
worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, 
the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste 
system. The language of his poetry was a form of 
spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. 
He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is 
Kabir believed in a formless Supreme God and 
preached that the only path to salvation was through 
bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from 
among both Hindus and Muslims.
A Closer Look: Baba Guru Nanak
We know more about Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) 
than about Kabir. Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib 
in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a 
centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). 
A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his 
own hymns was established there for his followers. 
Irrespective of their former 
creed, caste or gender, his 
followers ate together in the 
common kitchen (
The 
sacred space thus created by 
Baba Guru Nanak was known 
as 
. It is now known 
as Gurdwara.
Before his death in 1539, 
Baba Guru Nanak appointed 
one of his followers as his 
successor. His name was Lehna 
but he came to be known as 
Guru Angad, signifying that  
he was a part of Baba Guru 
Nanak himself. Guru Angad 
compiled the compositions  
of Baba Guru Nanak, to  
which he added his own in

a new script known as Gurmukhi. 
The three successors of Guru Angad 
also wrote under the name of “Nanak” 
and all of their compositions were 
compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this 
compilation were added the writings of 
Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh 
Bahadur. In 1706, this compilation was 
authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur’s 
son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. 
It is now known as 
, 
the holy scripture of the Sikhs.
The number of Baba Guru Nanak’s 
followers increased through the sixteenth century 
under his successors. They belonged to a number 
of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and 
craftsmen predominated. This may have something 
to do with Baba Guru Nanak’s insistence that his 
followers must be householders and should adopt 
productive and useful occupations. They were also 
expected to contribute to the general funds of the 
community of followers. 
By the beginning of the seventeenth century, the 
town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around 
the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden 
Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern 
historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh 
community as ‘a state within the state’. The Mughal 
emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential 
threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan 
in 1606.  The Sikh movement began to get politicised 
in the seventeenth century, a development which 
culminated in the institution of the 
 by Guru 
Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, 
called the

of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this 
development from the very beginning. He emphasised 
the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted 
that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining 
liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state 
of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with 
a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used 
the terms 
, 
 and 
 for the essence of his 
teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare 
of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are 
now remembered as 
, 
 and 
, which also underline the importance of right 
belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. 
Thus, Baba Guru Nanak’s idea of equality had social 
and political implications. This might partly explain 
the difference between the history of the followers of 
Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of 
like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu, whose ideas were very 
similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak.

THE MAKING OF 
REGIONAL CULTURES
O
ne of the commonest ways of describing people  
is in terms of the language they speak. When we 
refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually 
means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives 
in Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate 
each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, 
poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take 
these identities for granted and assume that they have 
existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers 
separating regions have evolved over time (and in 
fact are still changing). Also, what we understand 
as regional cultures today are often the product of 
complex processes of intermixing of local traditions 
with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. As 
regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and 
yet others derive from older practices in a particular 
area, but take a new form in other regions. 
The Cheras and the Development               
of Malayalam 
Let us begin by looking at an example of the 
connection between language and region. The Chera 
kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in 
the ninth century in the south-western part of the 
peninsula, part of the present-day Kerala. It is likely 
that Malayalam was spoken in this area. The rulers 
introduced the Malayalam language and script in their 
inscriptions. In fact, this is one of the earliest examples 
 
the subcontinent.

At the same time, the Cheras also drew upon 
Sanskritic traditions. The temple theatre of Kerala, 
which is traced to this period, borrowed stories 
Malayalam, dated to about the twelfth century, are 
directly indebted to Sanskrit.  Interestingly enough, a 
fourteenth-century text, the 
dealing with 
grammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalam 
– literally, “diamonds and corals” referring to the two 
languages, Sanskrit and the regional language.   
Rulers and Religious Traditions:              
The Jagannatha Cult
In other regions, regional cultures grew around 
religious traditions. The best example of this 
process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of 
the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To 
date, the local tribal people make 
the wooden image of the deity, which 
suggests that the deity was originally 
with Vishnu.
In the twelfth century, one of the 
most important rulers of the Ganga 
dynasty, Anantavarman, decided 
to erect a temple for Purushottama 
Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 
1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated 
his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed 
himself as the “deputy” of the god.

81
THE MAKING OF  
REGIONAL CULTURES
As the temple gained in 
importance as a centre of 
pilgrimage, its authority in 
social and political matters 
also increased. All those who 
conquered Orissa, such as 
the Mughals, the Marathas 
and the English East India 
Company, attempted to gain 
control over the temple. They felt 
that this would make their rule 
acceptable to the local people.  
The Rajputs and 
Traditions of Heroism
In the nineteenth century, the 
region that constitutes most 
of present-day Rajasthan, 
was called Rajputana by the British. While this may 
suggest that this was an area that was inhabited 
only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. 
There were (and are) several groups who identify 
themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern 
and central India. And of course, there are several 
peoples other than Rajputs who live in 
Rajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often 
recognised as contributing to the distinctive  
culture of Rajasthan. 
These cultural traditions were closely linked 
with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. 
From about the eighth century, most of the 
present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by 
various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) 
was one such ruler. These rulers cherished 
the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, 
than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes 
were recorded in poems and songs, which 
were recited by specially trained minstrels.

Puri.

82
These preserved the memories of heroes and were 
expected to inspire others to follow their example. 
Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories 
– which often depicted dramatic situations, and a 
range of strong emotions – loyalty, friendship, love, 
valour, anger, etc. 
Did women find a place within these stories? 
Sometimes women are depicted as following their 
heroic husbands in both life and death – there are 
stories about the practice of 
or the immolation 
of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So 
those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay 
for it with their lives.

Beyond Regional Frontiers:               
The Story of Kathak 
If heroic traditions can be found in different regions in 
different forms, the same is true of dance. Let us look at 
the history of one dance form, Kathak now associated 
with several parts of north India. The term 
 
is derived from 
, a word used in Sanskrit and 
other languages for story. The 
 were originally 
a caste of story-tellers in temples of north India, who 
embellished their performances with gestures and 
songs. Kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of 
the spread of the bhakti movement. The legends of 
Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called r
, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures 
of the 
 story-tellers.
Under the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak 
was performed in the court, where it acquired its present 
features and developed into a form of dance with a 
distinctive style. Subsequently, it developed in two 
traditions or 
: one in the courts of Rajasthan 
(Jaipur) and the other in Lucknow Under the patronage 
of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, it grew into 
a major art form. By the third quarter of the nineteenth

Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Emphasis was laid on 
intricate and rapid footwork, elaborate costumes, as 
well as on the enactment of stories. 
Kathak, like several other cultural practices, was 
viewed with disfavour by most British administrators 
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, it 
survived and continued to be performed by courtesans, 
and was recognised as one of the six “classical” forms 
of dance in the country after independence.

“Classical” dances
The question of defining any art form as “classical” 
is often quite complicated. Do we define something 
as classical if it deals with a religious theme? Or do 
we consider it classical because it appears to require 
a great deal of skill acquired through long years of 
training? Or is it classical because it is performed 
according to rules that are laid down, and variations 
are not encouraged? These are questions we need to 
think about. It is worth remembering that many dance 
forms that are classified as “folk” also share several 
of the characteristics considered 
typical of “classical” forms. So, 
while the use of the term 
“classical” may suggest 
that these forms are 
superior, this need not 
always be literally true.

Painting for Patrons: The Tradition            
of Miniatures
Another tradition that developed in different ways was 
that of miniature painting. Miniatures (as their very 
name suggests) are small-sized paintings, generally 
done in water colour on cloth or paper. The earliest 
miniatures were on palm leaves or wood. Some of the 
most beautiful of these, found in western India, were 
used to illustrate Jaina texts. The Mughal emperors 
Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised highly 
skilled painters who primarily illustrated manuscripts 
containing historical accounts and poetry. These were 
generally painted in brilliant colours and portrayed 
court scenes, scenes of battle or hunting, and other 
aspects of social life. They were often 
exchanged as gifts and were viewed 
only by an exclusive few – the emperor 
and his close associates.
With the decline of the Mughal 
Empire, many painters moved 
out to the courts of the emerging 
regional states (see also Chapter 8). 
As a result Mughal artistic tastes 
influenced the regional courts of 
the Deccan and the Rajput courts 
of Rajasthan. At the same time, 
they retained and developed their 
distinctive characteristics. Portraits 
of rulers and court scenes came to 
be painted, following the Mughal 
example. Besides, themes from 
mythology and poetry were depicted 
at centres such as Mewar, Jodhpur, 
Bundi, Kota and Kishangarh. 
Another region that attracted 
miniature paintings was the 
Himalayan foothills around the 
modern-day state of Himachal 
Pradesh. By the late seventeenth

86
century, this region had developed a bold and intense 
style of miniature painting called Basohli. The most 
popular text to be painted here was Bhanudatta’s 
. Nadir Shah’s invasion and the conquest 
of Delhi in 1739 resulted in the migration of Mughal 
artists to the hills to escape the uncertainties of the 
plains. Here they found ready patrons which led to 
the founding of the Kangra school of painting. By the 
mid-eighteenth century the Kangra artists developed 
a style which breathed a new spirit into miniature 
painting. The source 
of inspiration was the 
Vaishnavite traditions. 
Soft colours including 
cool blues and greens,

A Closer Look:  Bengal 
The Growth of a Regional Language
As we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions 
in terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we 
assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. 
However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is 
now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, 
BCE) suggest 
that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic  
languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? 
From the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties 
began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south 
of Sanskrit. During the fourth century, the Gupta 
rulers established political control over north Bengal 
and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the 
valley became stronger. In the seventh century, the 
Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages 
related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. 
From the eighth century, Bengal became the centre 
of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). 
Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of 
the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar

conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal 
While Persian was the language of administration, 
Bengali developed as a regional language. 
of dialects came to be united by a common literary 
language based on the spoken language of the western 
part of the region, now known as West Bengal. 
Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it 
passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a 
wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a 
variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, 
and European languages, have become a part of  
modern Bengali. 
Early Bengali literature may be divided into two 
categories – one indebted to Sanskrit and the other 
Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious 
poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature, 
such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader 
of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 6). 
The second includes Nath literature, such as 
the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories 
concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy 
tales, folk tales and ballads. 
Maynamati, Gopichandra and                  
Dharma Thakur 
The Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of 
yogic practices. 
This particular song, which was often enacted, 
described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her 
son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the 
face of a variety of obstacles. 
Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often 
worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood.

and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly 
Brahmanas was relatively weak.
Pirs and Temples
From the sixteenth century, people began to migrate 
in large numbers from the less fertile western Bengal 
to the forested and marshy areas of south-eastern 
Bengal. As they moved eastwards, they cleared 
forests and brought the land under rice cultivation. 
Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and 
shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the 
new communities of peasants. 
This coincided with the establishment of Mughal 
control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of 
received land and often set up mosques that served 
as centres for religious transformation in these areas.  
The early settlers sought some order and assurance 
in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. 
These were provided by community leaders, who also 
functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were 
sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People 
referred to them with affection and respect as
.
This term included saints or Sufis and other 
soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even 
animistic spirits. The cult of 
 became very popular 
and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal.  
Bengal also witnessed a temple-building spree 
the nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapter 2) 
that temples and other religious structures were often 
built by individuals or groups who were becoming 
powerful – to both demonstrate their power and 
proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick  
90
and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the 
support of several “low” social groups, such as the 
Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). 
The coming of the European trading companies created 
new economic opportunities; many families belonging 
to these social groups availed of these. As their social 
and economic position improved, they proclaimed 
their status through the construction of temples. 
When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts 
in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, 
their images began to be housed in temples. The 
temples began to copy the double-roofed (
) or 
four-roofed (
) structure of the thatched huts. 
This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in  
temple architecture. 
In the comparatively more complex four-roofed 
structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four 
walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. 
Temples were usually built on a square platform. The 
interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many 
temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental 
tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly 
in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, 
such decorations reached a high degree of excellence.

temple shown 
here with that in

something significant happening in the subcontinent 
during the first half of the eighteenth century. Notice 
how the boundaries of the Mughal Empire were 
reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent

kingdoms. By 1765, 
notice how another 
power, the British, had 
successfully grabbed 
major chunks of territory 
in eastern India. What 
these maps tell us is 
that political conditions 
in eighteenth-century 
India changed quite 
dramatically and within 
a relatively short span 
of time. 
In this chapter, we 
will read about the 
emergence of new 
political groups in the 
subcontinent during 
the first half of the 
eighteenth century – 
roughly from 1707, 
when Aurangzeb died, 
till the third battle of 
Panipat in 1761.
The Crisis of the Empire and  
the Later Mughals
In Chapter 4, you saw how the Mughal Empire reached 
the height of its success and started facing a variety 
of crises towards the closing years of the seventeenth 
century. These were caused by a number of factors. 
Emperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and 
financial resources of his empire by fighting a long 
war in the Deccan. 
Under his successors, the efficiency of the imperial 
administration broke down. It became increasingly 
difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check 
on their powerful mansabdars. Nobles appointed 
as governors (subadars) often controlled the offices

of revenue and military administration (diwani and 
faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political, 
economic and military powers over vast regions of the 
Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their 
control over the provinces, the periodic remission of 
revenue to the capital declined.
Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of 
northern and western India added to these problems. 
These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures 
of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts 
by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own 
positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by 
rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups 
were now able to seize the economic resources of the 
region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal 
emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the 
gradual shifting of political and economic authority 
into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains 
and other groups. 
Rich harvests and empty coffers 
The following is a contemporary writer’s account of the 
financial bankruptcy of the empire: 
The great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants 
raise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either, and 
their agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the peasants’ 
hands, like a peasant kept in his creditor’s house until he 
can pay his debt. So complete is the collapse of all order and 
administration that though the peasant reaps a harvest of 
gold, his lord does not see so much as a wisp of straw. How 
then can the lord keep the armed force he should? How can 
he pay the soldiers who should go before him when he goes 
out, or the horsemen who should ride behind him?

In the midst of this economic and political crisis, the 
ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the 
city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts 
of wealth. This invasion was followed by a series of 
plundering raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah 
Abdali, who invaded north India five times between 
1748 and 1761.
Nadir Shah attacks Delhi
The devastation of Delhi after Nadir Shah’s invasion was 
described by contemporary observers. One described 
the wealth looted from the Mughal treasury as follows: 
sixty lakhs of rupees and some thousand gold coins, nearly one 
crore worth of gold-ware, nearly fifty crores worth of jewels, 
most of them unrivalled in the world, and the above included 
the Peacock throne.
 Another account described the invasion’s impact 
upon Delhi: 
(those) … who had been masters were now in dire straits; 
and those who had been revered couldn’t even (get water 
to) quench their thirst. The recluses were pulled out of their 
corners. The wealthy were turned into beggars. Those who 
once set the style in clothes now went naked; and those 
who owned property were now homeless … The New City 
(Shahjahanabad) was turned into rubble. (Nadir Shah) then 
attacked the Old quarters of the city and destroyed a whole 
world that existed there …

Shah.
Already under severe pressure from all sides, the 
empire was further weakened by competition amongst 
different groups of nobles. They were divided into 
two major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis 
(nobles of Turkish descent). For a long time, the later 
Mughal emperors were puppets in the hands of either

one or the other of these two powerful groups. 
The worst possible humiliation came when two 
Mughal emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713 –1719) 
and Alamgir II (1754 –1759) were assassinated, 
and two others, Ahmad Shah (1748 –1754) and 
Shah Alam II (1759 –1816) were blinded by  
their nobles.
With the decline in the authority of the 
Mughal emperors, the governors of large 
provinces, subadars, and the great zamindars 
consolidated their authority in different parts 
of the subcontinent, such as Awadh, Bengal  
and Hyderabad. 
The Rajputs 
Many Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to 
Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals 
with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to 
enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In 
the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to 
extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh, 
the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional 
politics at the Mughal court. 
These influential Rajput families claimed the 
subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa. 
Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of 
Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was the 
governor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by 
Emperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to 
extend their territories by seizing portions of imperial 
territories neighbouring their watans. Nagaur was 
conquered and annexed to the house of Jodhpur, 
while Amber seized large portions of Bundi. Sawai 
Raja Jai Singh founded his new capital at Jaipur 
and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. Maratha 
campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe 
pressure on these principalities and checked their 
further expansion.

Seizing Independence
The Sikhs
The organisation of the Sikhs into a political community 
during the seventeenth century (see Chapter 6) helped 
in regional state-building in the Punjab. Several battles 
were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput 
and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution 
of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa 
rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda 
Bahadur’s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by 
striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru 
Gobind Singh, and established their own administration 
between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur 
was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716.

century, the Sikhs organised themselves into a 
number of bands called jathas, and later on misls. 
Their combined forces were known as the grand 
army (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet 
at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to 
take collective decisions known as “resolutions of 
the Guru (gurmatas)”. A system called rakhi was 
introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the 
payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. 
Guru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with 
the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega 
khalsa). Their well-knit organisation enabled them 
to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal 
governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who 
had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the 
Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa 
declared their sovereign rule by striking their own 
coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the 
same inscription as the one on the orders issued by 
the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur.  
The Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century 
extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they 
were divided under different rulers. One of them, 
Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and 
established his capital at Lahore in 1799.  
The Marathas
The Maratha kingdom was established by Chhatrapati 
Shivaji Maharaj (1630). The Maratha kingdom was 
another powerful regional kingdom to arise out 
of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji 
(1630–1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the 
support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). 
Groups of highly mobile, peasant-pastoralists 
(kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha 
army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the 
Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji’s death, 
effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a 
family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji’s 
successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona 
became the capital of the Maratha kingdom.

Towards the end of the 
17th century,  
a powerful state 
started emerging in 
the Deccan under the 
leadership of Shivaji 
which finally led to the 
establishment of the 
Maratha state. Shivaji 
was born to Shahji and 
Jija Bai at Shivneri 
in 1630.  Under the 
guidance of his mother 
and his guardian 
Dada Konddev, Shivaji 
embarked on a career 
of conquest at a young 
age. The occupation 
of Javli made him the 
undisputed leader of 
the Mavala highlands 
which paved the way 
for further expansion. 
His exploits against 
the forces of Bijapur 
and the Mughals 
made him a legendary 
figure. He often 
resorted to guerrilla 
warfare against 
his opponents. By 
introducing an efficient 
administrative system 
supported by a revenue 
collection method 
based on chauth and 
sardeshmukhi, he laid 
the foundations of a 
strong Maratha state.

Under the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very 
successful military organisation. Their success lay 
in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by 
raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas 
where their supply lines and reinforcements could be 
easily disturbed. 
Between 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire 
expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority 
of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized 
from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the 
Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the 
entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to 
levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.  
After raiding Delhi in 1737, the frontiers of Maratha 
domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the 
Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the 
east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu 
countries in the South (see Map 1). These were not 
formally included in the Maratha empire, but were 
made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha 
sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, 
but it came at a price. These military campaigns also 
made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a 
result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas 
during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.
Alongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas 
developed an effective administrative system as well. 
Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule 
was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced 
taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was 
encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha 
chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of 
Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise 
powerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in 
the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity 
of the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under 
Sindhia’s patronage and Indore under Holkar’s. By 
all accounts, these cities were large and prosperous 
and functioned as important commercial and cultural 
centres. New trade routes emerged within the areas 
controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the 
Chanderi region now found a new outlet in Poona, 
the Maratha capital. Burhanpur which had earlier

The Jats
Like the other states, the Jats consolidated their power 
during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. 
Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control 
over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, 
and by the 1680s, they had begun dominating the 
region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and 
Agra. For a while, they became the virtual custodians 
of the city of Agra.  
The Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns 
like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important 
trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under 
Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a 
strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, 
many of the city’s notables took refuge there. His son 
Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired 
another 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to 
fight the Mughals.
While the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly 
traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate 
garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. 
Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first 
associated with royalty under Shah Jahan.

ake a look at Maps 1 and 2. Map 1 was made in  
1154  CE by the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi. The 
section reproduced here is a detail of the Indian 
subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2 
was made in the 1720s by a French cartographer. The 
two maps are quite different even though they are of the 
same area. In al-Idrisi’s map, south India is where we

was made nearly 600 years after Map 1, during this 
period, information about the subcontinent had 
changed considerably. This map seems more familiar to 
us and the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly 
detailed. This map was used by European sailors and 
merchants on their voyages.

INTRODUCTION: TRA... 
Equally important is the fact that the science 
of cartography differed in the two periods. When 
historians read documents, maps and texts from the 
past, they have to be sensitive to the different historical 
backgrounds – the 
 – in which information 
about the past was produced.
New and Old Terminologies
If the context in which information is produced 
changes with time, what about language and 
meanings? Historical records exist in a variety of 
languages which have changed considerably over 
the years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different 
from modern Persian. The difference is not just with 
regard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of 
words also change over time. 
Take the term “Hindustan”, for example. Today we 
understand it as “India”, the modern 
. 
When the term was used in the thirteenth century by 
meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands 
between the Ganga and Yamuna. He used the term 
in a political sense for lands that were a part of the 
the term never included south India. By contrast, in 
the early sixteenth century, Babur used Hindustan 
to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture 
of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see 
later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the 
way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used 
the word “Hind”. While the idea of a geographical 
and cultural entity like “India” did exist, the term 
“Hindustan” did not carry the political and national 
meanings which we associate with it today. 
Historians today have to be careful about the terms 
they use because they meant different things in the 
past. Take, for example, a simple term like “foreigner”. 
It is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian.  
Can you think of 
any other words 
whose meanings 
change in 
different contexts? 
?

In the medieval period, a “foreigner” was any stranger 
who appeared say in a given village, someone who was 
not a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term 
 might be used to describe such a person and 
in Persian, 
.) A city-dweller, therefore, might 
have regarded a forest-dweller as a “foreigner”, but two 
peasants living in the same village were not foreigners 
to each other, even though they may have had different 
religious or caste backgrounds.
Historians and their Sources
Historians use different types of sources to learn about 
the past depending upon the period of their study 
example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty 
and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about 
the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. 
You will notice some continuity in the sources used 
by historians for the study of this period. They still 
rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual 
records for information. But there is also considerable 
discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records 
increased dramatically during this period. They slowly 
displaced other types of available information. Through 
this period, paper gradually became cheaper and more  
The value of paper
Compare the following: 
(1) In the middle of the thirteenth century a scholar 
wanted to copy a book. But he did not have enough 
paper. So he washed the writing off a manuscript he 
did not want, dried the paper and used it. 
(2) A century later, if you bought some food in the 
market you could be lucky and have the shopkeeper 
wrap it for you in some paper.
When was paper more expensive and easily available 
– in the thirteenth or the fourteenth century?

widely available. People used it to write holy texts, 
chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, 
petitions and judicial records, and for registers of 
accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by 
wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They 
were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts

New Social and Political Groups
The study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 
is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the 
scale and variety of developments that occurred over 
the period. At different moments in this period, new 
technologies made their appearance – like the Persian

wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and 
in the subcontinent – potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and 
coffee. Remember that all these innovations – new 
technologies and crops – came along with people, who 
brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this 
was a period of economic, political, social and cultural 
changes. You will learn about some of these changes 
in Chapter 5. 
This was also a period of great mobility. Groups 
of people travelled long distances in search of 
opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth 
and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One 
group of people who became important in this period 
were the Rajputs, a name derived from “Rajaputra”, 
the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth 
centuries, the term was applied more generally to a 
group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status.

The term included not just rulers and chieftains but 
also soldiers and commanders who served in the 
armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. 
A chivalric code of conduct – extreme valour and a 
great sense of loyalty – were the qualities attributed 
to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups 
and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) 
also used the opportunities of the age to become  
politically important. 
Throughout this period there was a gradual 
clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, 
a change faster and more complete in some areas 
than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many 
forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the 
land and became peasants. These new peasant groups

became a part of large, complex societies, and were 
required to pay taxes and offer goods and services 
to local lords. As a result, significant economic

Language and region 
In 1318, the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was 
a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, 
Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), 
Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma‘bari 
(in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) … Awadhi (in eastern 
Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). 
Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to 
these languages, there was Sanskrit which did not 
belong to any region. It was an old language and “common 
people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do”.
Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir 
Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages  
spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline 
the names that are similar and circle those that  
are different. 
Did you notice that the names by which languages 
are known have changed over time? 
By 700 many regions already possessed distinct 
geographical dimensions and their own language and 
cultural characteristics. You will learn more about 
these in Chapter 7. They were also associated with 
like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals 
were able to build an empire that was pan-regional – 
spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were 
equally stable or successful.

INTRODUCTION: TRA...

When the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth 
century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states 
had altered the character of the regions. Across most of 
the subcontinent, the regions were left with the legacies 
of the big and small states that had ruled over them. 
This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct 
and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, 
the management of the economy, elite cultures and 
language. Through the thousand years between 700 
and 1750, the character of the different regions did 
not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of 
larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever 
quite losing their distinctiveness. 
Old and New Religions
The thousand years of history that we are exploring 
witnessed major developments in religious traditions. 
People’s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply 
personal, but more usually it was collective. Collective 
belief in a supernatural agency – religion – was often 
closely connected with the social and economic 
organisation of local communities. As the social worlds 
of these groups altered, so too did their beliefs.
It was during this period that important changes 
occurred in what we call Hinduism today. These 
included the worship of new deities, the construction 
of temples by royalty and the growing importance of 
Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society. 
Brahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant 
position was consolidated by the support of their 
patrons – new rulers searching for prestige.  
One of the major developments of this period was the 
emergence of the idea of bhakti – of a loving, personal 
deity that devotees could reach without the aid of 
priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about 
this, and other traditions, in Chapter 6.

This was also the period when new religions

to India in the seventh century. Muslims regard the 
 as their holy book and accept the sovereignty 
of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and bounty 
embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard 
to social background.
Many rulers were patrons of Islam and the 
learned theologians and jurists. And like Hinduism, 
Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways by its 
that the Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law, Ali, was 
the legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and 
the early leaders (Khalifas) of the community, and 
the succeeding Khalifas. There were other important 
and
 
mystic traditions.
Thinking about Time and                  
Historical Periods
Historians do not see time just as a passing of hours, 
days or years – as a clock or a calendar. Time also 
in the persistence and transformation of ideas and 
beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by 
dividing the past into large segments – periods – that 
possess shared characteristics. 
In the middle of the nineteenth century, British 
historians divided the history of India into three 
periods: “Hindu”, “Muslim” and “British”.  This division 
was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the 
only important historical change, and that there were 
rich diversity of the subcontinent.  
13
INTRODUCTION: TRA... 
Few historians follow this periodisation today. Most 
look to economic and social factors to characterise 
the major elements of different moments of the past. 
The histories you read last year included a wide range 
of early societies – hunter-gatherers, early farmers, 
people living in towns and villages, and early empires 
and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this 
more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of 
regional and imperial state formations – sometimes at 
the cost of pastoral and forest people – the development 
of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the 
arrival of European trading companies.  
 These thousand years of Indian history witnessed 
considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and 
eighteenth centuries were quite different from the 
eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire 
period as one historical unit is not without its problems. 
Moreover, the “medieval” period is often contrasted with 
the “modern” period. “Modernity” carries with it a sense 
of material progress and intellectual advancement. This 
seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking 
in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this 
was not the case.
 During these thousand years, the societies of the 
subcontinent were transformed often and economies 
in several regions reached a level of prosperity that 
attracted the interest of European trading companies. 
As you read this book, look out for signs of change 
and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever 
you can, compare what you read in this book with 
continuities wherever you can, and look at the world 
around you to see what else has changed or remained 
the same.

The Emergence of New Dynasties
By the seventh century, there were big landlords or 
warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. 
Existing kings often acknowledged them as their 
subordinates or 
 They 
were expected to bring gifts for their 
kings or overlords, be present at 
their courts and provide them with 
military support. As 
 gained 
power and wealth, they declared 
themselves to be 
, 
 (the great 
lord of a “circle” or region) and so 
independence from their overlords. 
One such instance was that of 
the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. 
Initially they were subordinate to 
the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the 
mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a 
Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and 
performed a ritual called 
 (literally, the 
golden womb). When this ritual was performed with 
the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the 
not one by birth.   
In other cases, men from enterprising families 
used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For 
instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the 
Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who 
gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, 
successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and 
Rajasthan respectively.  
Administration in the Kingdoms
Many of these new kings adopted high-sounding 
titles such as 
 (great king, overlord 
of kings), 
 (lord of the three 
worlds) and so on. However, in spite of such claims,

they often shared power with their

with associations of peasants, traders and Brahmanas.
In each of these states, resources were obtained 
from the producers – that is, peasants, cattle-keepers, 
artisans – who were often persuaded or compelled to 
these were claimed as “rent” due to a lord who asserted 
that he owned the land. Revenue was also collected 
from traders. 
Four hundred taxes!
The inscriptions of the Cholas who ruled in Tamil 
Nadu refer to more than 400 terms for different kinds 
of taxes. The most frequently mentioned tax is vetti, 
taken not in cash but in the form of forced labour, and 
kadamai, or land revenue. There were also taxes on 
thatching the house, the use of a ladder to climb palm 
trees, a cess on succession to family property, etc.  
Are any such taxes collected today?  
establishment, as well as for the construction of temples 
 
turn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the 
form of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes.
The functionaries for collecting revenue were 
generally recruited from influential families, and 
positions were often hereditary. This was true about 
the army as well. In many cases, close relatives of the 
king held these positions.
Prashastis and Land Grants 
contain details that may not be literally 
true. But they tell us how rulers wanted to depict 
themselves – as valiant, victorious warriors, for 
example. These were composed by learned Brahmanas, 
who occasionally helped in the administration.

administration

The “achievements” of Nagabhata
Many rulers described their achievements in prashastis 
(you read about the prashasti of the Gupta ruler 
Samudragupta last year). 
One prashasti, written in Sanskrit and found in 
Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, describes the exploits of 
Nagabhata, a Pratihara king, as follows:
The kings of Andhra, Saindhava (Sind), Vidarbha (part of 
Maharashtra) and Kalinga (part of Orissa) fell before him 
even as he was a prince …
He won a victory over Chakrayudha (the ruler of Kanauj) …
He defeated the king of Vanga (part of Bengal), Anarta (part 
of Gujarat), Malava (part of Madhya Pradesh), Kirata (forest 
peoples), Turushka (Turks), Vatsa, Matsya (both kingdoms 
in north India) …
Kings often rewarded Brahmanas by grants of land. 
These were recorded on copper plates, which were given 
to those who received the land.

What was given with the land
This is a part of the Tamil section of a land grant given 
by the Cholas: 
We have demarcated the boundaries of the land by making 
earthen embankments, as well as by planting thorny bushes. 
This is what the land contains: fruit-bearing trees, water, 
land, gardens and orchards, trees, wells, open spaces, 
pasture-land, a village, anthills, platforms, canals, ditches, 
and deep lakes. 
He who receives the land can collect taxes from it. He can

He can build large rooms, with upper stories made of baked 
bricks, he can get large and small wells dug, he can plant trees 
and thorny bushes, if necessary, he can get canals constructed 
for irrigation. He should ensure that water is not wasted, and 
that embankments are built.

and their policies.
Warfare for Wealth 
You may have noticed that each of these ruling

prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga 
valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-
Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for 
control over Kanauj. Because there were three “parties” 
it as the “tripartite struggle”. 
Rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and 
resources by building large temples. So, when they 
attacked one another’s kingdoms, they often chose to 
target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich.
One such ruler is Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. 
He raided the subcontinent 17 times (1000–1025) with 
a religious motive. His targets were wealthy temples, 
including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth 
Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid 
capital city at Ghazni.
Other kings who engaged in warfare included the 
Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who 
ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They 
attempted to expand their control to the west and 
the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas 
of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar 
Pradesh. The Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III 
(1168 –1192), who defeated a Turk ruler named Sultan 
Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very 
next year, in 1192. 
A Closer Look: The Cholas 
From Uraiyur to Thanjavur 
How did the Cholas rise to power? A minor  
chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held 
power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate 
to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, 
Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the 
Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He 
built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess  
Nishumbhasudini there.

may have wanted

territories.

Look at Map 1 and 
suggest reasons 
why these rulers

The successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring 
regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The 
Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and 
north were made part of this kingdom. Rajaraja I, 
considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became 
areas. He also reorganised the administration of 
the empire. Rajaraja’s son Rajendra I continued his 
these expeditions.

Chola temples often became the nuclei of settlements 
which grew around them. These were centres of craft 
production. Temples were also endowed with land by 
rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land 
went into maintaining all the specialists who worked 
at the temple and very often lived near it – priests, 
garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, 
etc. In other words, temples were not only places of 
worship; they were the centres of economic, social and 
cultural life. 
Amongst the crafts associated with temples, the 
making of bronze images was the most distinctive. 
Chola bronze images are considered amongst the 
sometimes images were made of devotees as well.

Agriculture and Irrigation 
Many of the achievements of the Cholas were 
made possible through new developments in 
the river Kaveri branches off into several 
small channels before emptying into the 
frequently, depositing fertile soil on 
their banks. Water from the channels 
also provides the necessary moisture 
for agriculture, particularly the 
cultivation of rice.
Although agriculture had 
developed earlier in other 
parts of Tamil Nadu, it was  
century that this area was opened 
up for large-scale cultivation. 
Forests had to be cleared in some 
regions; land had to be levelled in other 
areas. In the delta region, embankments 
canals had to be constructed to carry 
crops were grown in a year.
In many cases it was necessary to 
water crops artificially. A variety of 
methods were used for irrigation. In some 
areas wells were dug. In other places 
huge tanks were constructed to collect 
rainwater. Remember that irrigation 
works require planning – organising

labour and resources, maintaining these works and 
deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the 
new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an 
active interest in these activities.
The Administration of the Empire 
of peasants, known as 
, became prosperous 
with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups 
of such villages formed larger units called 
. 
The village council and the 
 performed several  
administrative functions including dispensing justice 
and collecting taxes. 
Rich peasants exercised considerable control 
over the affairs of the 
 under the supervision 
of the central Chola government. The Chola kings 
gave some rich landowners titles like 
  
(a 
 or peasant serving three kings), 
 
(chief), etc., as markers of respect, and entrusted them

We have seen that Brahmanas often received land 
grants or 
. As a result, a large number of 
Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley 
as in other parts of south India.  
Each 
was looked after by an assembly 
or 
 of prominent Brahmana landholders. These 
recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone 
walls of temples. Associations of traders known as 
 also occasionally performed administrative 
functions in towns. 
Inscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput 
district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in 
which the 
was organised. The 
 had 
separate committees to look after irrigation works, 
gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to 
be members of these committees were written on 
small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put 
into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy 
was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for  
each committee. 
Types of land
Chola inscriptions mention several categories of land:
vellanvagai 
land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors
brahmadeya                                                  
land gifted to Brahmanas
shalabhoga                                                    
land for the maintenance of a school

 Inscriptions and texts
Who could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur 
inscription lays down:
All those who wish to become members of the sabha should 
be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. 
They should have their own homes. 
They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. 
They should have knowledge of the Vedas. 
They should be well-versed in administrative matters                         
and honest. 
If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last 
three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. 
Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of 
his relatives, cannot contest the elections. 
While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, 
here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfth- 
century Tamil work, which informs us about the lives 
of ordinary men and women.
On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas           
(a name used for a social group considered “outcastes” by 
Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under 
old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged 
in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered 
with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; 
dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing 
about, carrying little puppies … In the shade of the marudu 
(arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a 
sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches 
drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little 
hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. 
The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny 
Pulaiyar (plural) to their day’s work; and by day, under the 
shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired 
Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy …
